1.18.010 Authority and purpose.

(1) RCW 42.56.070(1) requires each agency to make available for inspection and copying nonexempt “public records” in accordance with published rules. The Act, at RCW 42.56.010(3), defines “public record” to include any “writing containing information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned, used, or retained” by the agency regardless of physical form or characteristics, and specifically excludes records that are not otherwise required to be retained by the agency. RCW 42.56.070(2) requires each agency to set forth “for informational purposes” every law, in addition to the Public Records Act, that exempts or prohibits the disclosure of public records held by that agency.

(2) The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedures the city of Port Orchard will follow in order to provide full access to public records. These rules provide information to persons wishing to request access to public records of the city of Port Orchard and establish processes for both requestors and city of Port Orchard staff that are designed to best assist members of the public in obtaining such access.

(3) The purpose of the Act is to provide the public full access to information concerning the conduct of government, mindful of individuals’ privacy rights and the desirability of the efficient administration of government. The Act and these rules will be interpreted in favor of disclosure. In carrying out its responsibilities under the Act, the city of Port Orchard will be guided by the provisions of the Act describing its purposes and interpretation.

(4) The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to court case records and administrative court records maintained by the Port Orchard municipal court in connection to judicial proceedings and records related to the management, supervision, or administration of the court. Access to these records is governed by Washington State Court Rules General Rule 31, General Rule 31.1, and case law.

(5) The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to create any additional legal obligations upon the city or an independent cause of action against the city. (Ord. 029-17 § 1; Ord. 014-14 § 2; Ord. 033-08 § 1).


1.18.020 Location of Port Orchard City Hall – Contact information – Public records officer appointed.

(1) Port Orchard City Hall is located at: 216 Prospect Street, Port Orchard, WA 98366.

(2) Any person wishing to request access to public records or seeking assistance in making a request should contact the city’s public records officer. The city clerk is hereby designated as the public records officer for the city of Port Orchard. The mayor may, in his or her discretion, assign additional staff and/or the city attorney to assist the city clerk in responding to public records requests. Requests for records maintained by the Port Orchard police department will be processed by the police department. The city clerk will assist the police department as necessary.

(3) Public records requests relating to the records of the Port Orchard police department should be delivered to:

Public Records Officer: Port Orchard Police Department

546 Bay Street

Port Orchard, WA 98366

Phone (360) 876-1700

Fax (360) 876-5546

All other requests for access to the public records of the city of Port Orchard (or when seeking assistance in making such a request) should be delivered to the public records officer of the city of Port Orchard:

Public Records Officer: Port Orchard City Clerk

City of Port Orchard

216 Prospect Street

Port Orchard, WA 98366

Phone (360) 876-4407

Fax (360) 895-9029

(4) The public records officer will oversee compliance with the act but another employee or the city attorney may process the request. Therefore, these rules will refer to the public records officer “or designee.” The public records officer or designee and the city will provide the “fullest assistance” to requestors; ensure that public records are protected from damage or disorganization; and prevent fulfilling public records requests from causing excessive interference with essential functions of the city. (Ord. 014-14 § 3; Ord. 033-08 § 1).


1.18.030 Availability of public records.

(1) Hours for Inspection of Records. Pursuant to the provisions of POMC 1.18.040(7), once public records are available for inspection and copying, they shall be made available to the requestor during normal business hours of the city of Port Orchard, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. Records to be inspected must be viewed at the offices of the city of Port Orchard.

(2) Records Index. The city of Port Orchard finds that maintaining an index is unduly burdensome and would interfere with city of Port Orchard operations. The requirement would unduly burden or interfere with city of Port Orchard operations in the following ways: the magnitude and diversity of documents produced by city of Port Orchard departments and the employees within the departments, all utilizing their own computers, has resulted in the creation of many different indexes as created by the computer user. The diversity in computer program applications utilized on each personal computer and the organization of documents created by those applications is impossible to organize into a single index. The city of Port Orchard’s overall mission does not allow for the addition, revision, or reassignment of duties for existing personnel so that a single index can be developed and maintained without hiring additional staff. Anticipated revenue, along with adopted priorities for expenditures, does not allow for the hiring of additional staff whose job would be solely devoted to creating and maintaining a single, all-inclusive index.

(3) Organization of Records. The city of Port Orchard will maintain its records in a reasonably organized manner. The city of Port Orchard will take reasonable actions to protect records from damage and disorganization. A requestor shall not take original city of Port Orchard records from any of the city of Port Orchard’s offices.

(4) Internet Access to Records. Many records are also available on the city’s website. Requestors are encouraged to view the documents available on the website prior to submitting a public records request.

(5) Making a Request for Public Records. A public records request must be for identifiable records. A request for all or substantially all records prepared, owned, used, or retained by the city is not a valid request for identifiable records; provided, that a request for all records regarding a particular topic or containing a particular keyword or name shall not be considered a request for all of the city’s records. Any person wishing to inspect or copy public records of the city of Port Orchard should make the request in writing on the city of Port Orchard public records request form, on the Public Records Center portal on the city’s website, by letter, fax, or email addressed to the public records officer to include the information listed below:

(a) Name of requestor;

(b) Address of requestor, if applicable;

(c) Other contact information, including telephone number and/or email address;

(d) Sufficient identification/description of the public records being sought;

(e) The date of the request; and

(f) Whether the requestor wishes to:

(i) Inspect the records (inspection of records is free of charge);

(ii) Have copies made of the records (cost charged to requestor);

(iii) Have the records copied to disc, if technically feasible (cost of disc charged to requestor);

(iv) Have the records scanned and provided via email or copied to disc (scanning cost and disc cost charged to requestor); or

(v) Have the records provided via email, if technically feasible (cost charged to requestor).

(6) Request Form. A form for requesting public records is available for use by requestors at City Hall and online at the city’s website.

(7) The city may deny a bot request that is one of multiple requests from the requestor within a 24-hour period, as responding to multiple requests of this nature would cause excessive interference with other essential functions of the city. “Bot request” means a request for public records that the city reasonably believes was automatically generated by a computer program or script.

(8) Accepting Public Records Requests. The public records officer or designee may accept requests for public records that contain the above information by telephone, fax, email, from the Public Records Center portal, mail services, or in person.

(9) Readily Available Public Records. In the event the records requested in any department are readily available, of a routine nature, and do not involve the interest of any other person, the public records officer or designee may authorize the immediate inspection and/or copying of such record without the necessity of filing the request as provided in subsection (5) of this section. (Ord. 029-17 § 2; Ord. 014-14 § 4; Ord. 033-08 § 1).


1.18.040 Processing of public records requests – General.

(1) Prompt Response. The public records officer or designee will process requests in the order allowing the most requests to be processed promptly and in the most efficient manner.

(2) Acknowledging Receipt of Request. Within five business days of receipt of the request, the public records officer will acknowledge the request in one of the ways provided in this subsection:

(a) Provide the record;

(b) Provide an Internet address and link on the city’s website to the specific records request, unless the requestor notifies the agency they cannot access the records through the Internet, then the city must provide copies of the record or allow the requester to view the copies; if copies are requested, provide the copies to the requestor after payment for the copies has been made by the requestor, or, if copies are being released in installments, after payment of a deposit is made pursuant to POMC 1.18.070;

(c) Acknowledge the request and provide a reasonable estimate of time the city will require to respond to the request. Additional time needed to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify the intent of the request, to locate and assemble the documentation requested, to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, or to determine whether any of the information in the documentation requested is exempt and that a denial should be made as to all or part of the request;

(d) Acknowledge the request and ask for clarification of a request that is unclear, and providing, to the greatest extent possible, a reasonable estimate of the time needed to respond to the request if it is not clarified;

(e) If the request is unclear or does not sufficiently identify the requested records, request clarification from the requestor. Such clarification may be requested and provided by telephone. The public records officer or designee may revise the estimate of when records will be available based on the clarification from the requestor. If the requestor fails to respond to the request to clarify and the entire request is unclear, the city of Port Orchard need not respond to the request. Otherwise the city will respond to the portions of the request that are clear; or

(f) Deny the request accompanied by a written statement of the specific reasons.

(3) Consequences of Failure to Respond. If the city of Port Orchard does not respond in writing within five business days of receipt of the request for disclosure, the requestor should consider contacting the public records officer to determine the reason for the failure to respond.

(4) Protecting Rights of Others. In the event that the requested records contain information that may affect the rights of others and may be exempt from disclosure, the public records officer may, prior to providing the records, give notice to such others whose rights may be affected by the disclosure. Such notice should be given so as to make it possible for those other persons to seek an order from a court to prevent or limit the disclosure. The notice to the affected persons will include a copy of the request.

(5) Records Exempt from Disclosure. Some records are exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part. If the city believes that a record is exempt from disclosure and should be withheld, the public records officer will state the specific exemption and provide a brief explanation of why the record or a portion of the record is being withheld. If only a portion of a record is exempt from disclosure, but the remainder is not exempt, the public records officer will redact the exempt portions, provide the nonexempt portions, and indicate to the requestor why portions of the record are being redacted.

(6) Privilege Log. If the city determines that a record is exempt and should be withheld, in whole or in part, the city will maintain a privilege log of those records. The privilege log will identify:

(a) Type of record withheld;

(b) Date of record;

(c) Number of pages;

(d) Author and/or recipient;

(e) The exemption invoked; and

(f) Brief explanation of the exemption.

A copy of the privilege log will be produced to the records requestor.

(7) Inspection of Records. If a requestor seeks an opportunity to inspect public records, and once the records are available for inspection, the following provisions apply:

(a) Consistent with other demands, the city of Port Orchard shall promptly provide space to inspect public records. No member of the public may remove a document from the viewing area or disassemble or alter any document. The requestor shall indicate which documents he or she wishes the agency to copy. The public records officer or designee will be present when records are being inspected.

(b) The requestor must claim or review the assembled records within 30 days of the city of Port Orchard notification to him or her that the records are available for inspection or copying. The city will notify the requestor in writing of this requirement and inform the requestor that he or she should contact the city to make arrangements to claim or review the records. If the requestor or a representative of the requestor fails to claim or review the records within the 30-day period or make other arrangements, the city of Port Orchard may close the request and refile the assembled records. Other public records requests can be processed ahead of a subsequent request by the same person for the same or almost identical records, which can be processed as a new request.

(8) Providing Copies of Records. After inspection is complete, the public records officer or designee shall make any requested copies or arrange for copying.

(9) Providing Records in Installments. When the request is for a large number of records, the public records officer or designee will provide access for inspection and copying in installments, if he or she reasonably determines that it would be practical to provide the records in that way. If, within 30 days, the requestor fails to inspect either the entire set of records made available, or one or more of the installments made available, the public records officer or designee may stop searching for the remaining records and close the request.

(10) Completion of Inspection. When the inspection of the requested records is complete and all requested copies are provided, the public records officer or designee will indicate that the city of Port Orchard has completed a diligent search for the requested records and made any located nonexempt records available for inspection and/or copying.

(11) Closing Withdrawn or Abandoned Request. When the requestor either withdraws the request or fails to fulfill his or her obligations to inspect the records or pay the deposit or final payment for the requested copies, the public records officer will close the request and indicate to the requestor that the city of Port Orchard has closed the request.

(12) Later Discovered Documents. If, after the city of Port Orchard has informed the requestor that it has provided all available records, the city of Port Orchard becomes aware of additional responsive documents existing at the time of the request, it will promptly inform the requestor of the additional documents and make the records available for inspection or copying.

(13) No Duty to Create Records. The city is not obligated to create a new record in order to satisfy a request for records. (Ord. 029-17 § 3; Ord. 014-14 § 5; Ord. 033-08 § 1).


1.18.050 Processing of public records requests – Electronic records.

(1) Requesting Electronic Records. The process for requesting electronic public records is the same as the process for requesting paper public records.

(2) Providing Electronic Records. When a requestor requests records in an electronic format, if technically feasible, the public records officer will provide the nonexempt records or portions of such records that are reasonably locatable in an electronic format that is used by the city of Port Orchard and is generally commercially available; or will provide the records in a format that is reasonably translatable from the format in which the agency keeps the record. (Ord. 014-14 § 6; Ord. 033-08 § 1).


1.18.060 Exemptions.

(1)  Chapter 42.56 RCW, Public Records Act, provides that a number of types of documents are exempt from public inspection and copying. In addition, documents are exempt from disclosure if any other statute exempts or prohibits disclosure. Requestors should be aware of other exemptions, outside the Public Records Act, that restrict the availability of some documents held by the city for inspection and copying. A list of such laws is available at the office of the city clerk and may be available at the city’s website.

(2) The city of Port Orchard is prohibited by statute from disclosing lists of individuals for commercial purposes. (Ord. 014-14 § 7; Ord. 033-08 § 1).


1.18.070 Costs of providing copies of public records.

(1) The city of Port Orchard finds that calculating the actual cost to charge the requestor is unduly burdensome and would interfere with the city of Port Orchard operations. The amount of work involved in calculating the cost in providing copies for all separate requests would require a significant portion of one employee’s time. The city of Port Orchard’s overall mission does not allow for the addition, revision, or reassignment of duties for existing personnel so that these calculations can be done without hiring additional staff. Anticipated revenue, along with adopted priorities for expenditures, does not allow for the hiring of an additional employee for this purpose. 

The city will charge the requestor for photocopies or electronically produced copies of public records in accordance with the charges set forth in RCW 42.56.120(2). Pursuant to that statute, the city will provide, upon request, a summary of the applicable charges before any copies are made to allow the requestor to revise the request to reduce the number of copies to be made and reduce the applicable charges.

(2) If a request requires the use of a commercial copy service, including but not limited to large-copy projects, color copies, and over-sized copies, the costs for copies will be the actual cost of the copies charged by such outside vendor.

The public records officer or designee may require a deposit of up to 10 percent of the estimated costs of copying the records selected or requested, including customized service charges. The public records officer or designee may also require payment in full of the remainder of the copying costs before providing all the records, after deducting any deposit paid. The public records officer or designee may request payment in full of the cost of copying an installment of records before providing that installment. The city of Port Orchard will not charge sales tax when copies of public records are reproduced at City Hall; however, if copies must be sent to an outside vendor for copying, the cost of sales tax will be charged to the requestor.

(3) Costs for Electronic Records. The cost of providing electronic copies of records on a CD-ROM disc will be the actual cost. If electronically produced copies are being provided by email or through the Public Records Portal, cost for the records will be in accordance with RCW 42.56.120. 

(4) Costs of Mailing. The city of Port Orchard may charge actual costs of mailing, including the cost of a shipping container; and the actual cost of long distance fax transmission.

(5) Payment. Payment for the costs of records may be made by cash, check, or money order made payable to the city of Port Orchard.

(6) Other statutes govern charges for particular kinds of records. As examples, RCW 46.52.085 (charges for traffic accident reports); RCW 10.97.100 (copies of criminal histories); RCW 3.62.060 and 3.62.065 (charges for certain records maintained by courts).

(7) The requestor may challenge the city’s fee estimate when the requestor believes the city has not made a “reasonable estimate of the charges to produce the copies of records” by seeking judicial review of the city’s action by filing a motion in Kitsap County superior court pursuant to the provisions of RCW 42.56.550.

(8) The city of Port Orchard has the discretion to waive charges for photocopies or electronically produced copies of public records. The city may also enter into a contract, memorandum of understanding, or other agreement with a requestor that provides an alternative fee arrangement to the charges authorized in RCW 42.56.120, or in response to a voluminous or frequently occurring request. The city will waive copying charges for documents that are less than 15 pages or the cost of up to two compact discs for administrative convenience, per request. (Ord. 029-17 § 4; Ord. 014-14 § 8; Ord. 033-08 § 1).


1.18.080 Review of denials of public records.

(1) Petition for Internal Administrative Review of Denial of Access. Any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing (including email) to the public records officer for a review of that decision. The petition shall include a copy of, or reasonably identify, the written statement by the public records officer or designee denying the request.

(2) Consideration of Petition for Review. The public records officer shall promptly provide the petition and any other relevant information to the Port Orchard mayor with a copy to the city attorney. The mayor will consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the city of Port Orchard’s receipt of the petition, or within such other time as the mayor and the requestor mutually agree.

(3) Alternative Dispute Resolution. In the event of a dispute regarding the inspection or copying of public records, the parties shall first meet in a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute by agreement of the parties or by mediation. The mediators will be selected from an approved list maintained by the city and available upon request. The party wishing to seek mediation shall provide 15 days’ written notice to the city.

(4) Judicial Review. Any person may obtain court review of denials of public records requests pursuant to RCW 42.56.550 at the conclusion of two business days after the initial denial regardless of any internal administrative review. (Ord. 014-14 § 9; Ord. 033-08 § 1).

Chapter 1.30 DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS PROPERTY

Sections: 

1.30.010    Purpose.

1.30.020    Procedures – Identification and sale of surplus property.

1.30.030    Disposition of proceeds of sale.


1.30.010 Purpose. 

This chapter establishes procedures for disposing of property, other than real estate, which is surplus to the needs of the city. It is the intention of the city council that the procedures set forth in this chapter are preferred over others; therefore, special procedures called for under other legislation are to be deemed exceptions to this chapter. (Ord. 058-17 § 1).


1.30.020 Procedures – Identification and sale of surplus property. 

(1) Identification of Surplus Property. The finance department shall generate and maintain a report identifying all surplus property based on evaluation of the city’s current and possible future use of property.

(2) Council Approval. The city clerk shall periodically submit the report to the city council for review and approval at a regular meeting. Disposition of surplus property must be approved by a majority of the city council. The council’s consideration for disposition shall include the following:

(a) Possible future requirements of the city;

(b) Present value of the property;

(c) Likelihood of locating a buyer;

(d) Intergovernmental cooperation;

(e) The general welfare of the citizens of the city.

(3) Frequency of Disposition. The city clerk shall, at least once a year and as often as is deemed advisable, sell or dispose of all city property designated surplus and approved by the city council.

(4) Methods of Disposition. Surplus property approved by the city council for disposition shall be disposed of through one of the following methods:

(a) Transfer to General Services Administration (GSA);

(b) Transfer to another agency of government;

(c) Public or privately operated consignment auction;

(d) Solicitation of written bids;

(e) Negotiated sale to one or more designated buyers;

(f) Trade-in upon the purchase of a like article; or

(g) Online auction or classifieds.

After attempting disposal of property under one or more of the preceding methods, the department director of the department in possession of the property is authorized to salvage any recyclable material and dispose of the remainder as refuse through appropriate methods of waste disposal where the surplus property due to damage, deterioration or obsolescence no longer has a market value or such market value is exceeded by the cost of repair and the continued cost of storage or the need of the city for existing space makes the continued storage of valueless items impracticable. If an item of property has been deemed by the department director to be of zero value, it may be disposed of in the best interests of the city without first attempting any of the preceding methods of disposal.

Nothing herein shall be interpreted to authorize the gifting of any item of value to a city employee or other private person. (Ord. 058-17 § 1).


1.30.030 Disposition of proceeds of sale. 

The proceeds of such sale are to be paid into the fund that owns the item. (Ord. 058-17 § 1).

2.76.120 Notice of decision.

Not later than five calendar days following the issuance of the examiner’s decision, copies thereof shall be mailed to the applicant, to parties of record and to any person who requested a copy of the decision. The original decision shall be maintained in the official record. (Ord. 047-07 § 13).


2.76.130 Reconsideration.

(1) Request for Reconsideration. The examiner has discretion whether to consider a request for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration must be in writing and filed by a party or aggrieved person within seven working days of the examiner’s decision. The request must include: the grounds for reconsideration, including specific reference to the decision and each claimed error therein whether error of law or fact, and any discovery of new evidence which, upon reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered by a party prior to the close of the hearing on the matter. Failure to allege error is grounds for summary denial of the request.

(2) Effect of Request. The filing of a request for reconsideration shall stay the running of the appeal period until the examiner issues a decision on the request. Upon issuance of a decision on a request for reconsideration, the time for filing an appeal will begin. The examiner will review the request in light of the official record and his or her decision, taking into account the grounds for the request. The examiner may deny the request; may set a hearing in order to supplement the official record and issue a revised decision following that hearing; or may revise the decision without a hearing. If the request is denied without further hearing or submission of materials by other parties, the denial must be issued in writing within five working days of the date of the request. The examiner has the authority to take any action consistent with the powers granted herein, in order to issue a decision on a request for reconsideration. Action taken by the examiner in response to a request for reconsideration, other than a denial, shall be in writing, and shall be issued within 21 calendar days of the date of the request. (Ord. 047-07 § 14).


2.76.140 Appeal from examiner’s decision.

(1) Jurisdiction. All appeals of a decision of the examiner will be to the city council.

(2) Standing. Only an aggrieved person shall have standing to appeal a decision of the examiner.

(3) How to Appeal.

(a) Only parties of record or an aggrieved person may appeal.

(b) An appeal must be in writing, and shall contain all grounds on which error is alleged, including specific reference to the official record and the decision and claimed errors in the decision whether they be errors of law or fact. Any reference to the official record must specify the document by name and/or exhibit number and should reference the applicable page number(s). Any reference to an error of law must include a specific reference to the law, municipal code, ordinance, policy or plan alleged to have been violated. The grounds on which the appeal is based shall be referred to herein as “the scope of the appeal.” The appeal must specify the action the appellant wishes the city council to take in order to correct the alleged error(s). Failure to raise a challenge to an issue of law or fact in the written appeal shall constitute a waiver of right to appeal on that issue of law or fact.

(c) A party of record or aggrieved person may include a group of people such as an association or legal entity. The group, association or entity must select a single contact person to represent the group and must identify that person in writing to the city, including the person’s address and telephone number(s). The identified contact person must be included with the written appeal, and the necessary fees. The identified contact person will receive required notices from the city pursuant to provisions of this chapter, and will be the contact person for purposes of procedural issues relating to the appeal. The purpose of selecting a single contact person to represent the group, association or entity is to avoid unnecessary duplication of written documents in support of or opposition to an appeal, to avoid delay in procedural matters, and to avoid duplication and unnecessary repetition of oral argument at the hearing set for the appeal. If a different contact person is later selected by the group or association, the city must be notified in writing of the change, including the address and telephone number(s) of the new contact person. Failure of receipt of any notice from the city, wherein the city was not timely notified of a change in the identified contact person, will not serve to raise any cognizable issue of denial of procedural due process.

(4) Fees for Appeal. An appeal will not be accepted unless accompanied by the required filing fee and the required deposit for a certified transcript of the hearing. The filing fee for an appeal shall be established by the council pursuant to the city’s fee resolution. In addition to the filing fee, the appellant must pay the costs for a certified transcription of the electronic recording of the hearing. The director will be responsible for obtaining a certified transcription in a timely manner upon receipt of the appeal and payment of the required filing fee and deposit for transcription services. If the actual costs of transcription are less than the deposit, a refund will be made to the appellant. If the actual costs of transcription are more than the deposit, the appellant must pay the additional costs upon notification by the director that costs are due. Failure to pay the actual costs of the transcript will be cause for dismissal of the appeal. Inability to pay the costs of the transcript will be taken into consideration by the examiner, upon submission of an affidavit of inability to pay, supported by documentation tending to prove the assertion of inability to pay. The appeal fee shall be refunded to the appellant, if the appellant substantially prevails on appeal. The city council shall decide whether an appellant has substantially prevailed on appeal, and shall so state in its decision and order. The transcription deposit and costs are nonrefundable.

(5) Effect of Appeal. The timely filing of an appeal will stay the effective date of the examiner’s decision until such time as the appeal is adjudicated by the city council or is withdrawn by the appellant.

No requirements for affordable housing are required for an eight-year tax exemption within either of these areas; or

(b) Within the area shown as “12 Year Eligible Area” in Figure 1 of this chapter, for 12 successive years beginning January 1st of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the certificate, if the property otherwise qualifies for the exemption under this chapter and meets the conditions in this subsection. For the property to qualify for the 12-year exemption under this subsection, the applicant must commit to renting or selling at least 20 percent of the multifamily housing units as affordable housing units to low- and moderate-income households, and the property must satisfy that commitment and any additional affordability and income eligibility conditions adopted by the city under this chapter. In the case of projects intended exclusively for owner occupancy, the minimum requirement of this subsection may be satisfied solely through housing affordable to moderate-income households.

(i) If calculations for the minimum 20 percent of the multifamily housing units required under this subsection result in a fraction, then the minimum number of multifamily housing units for affordable housing shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

(ii) In projects granted 12-year exemptions, housing units identified for households with low, affordable, or moderate annual income shall continue to be made available to low, affordable, or moderate households for the length of the exemption period.

(iii) The mix and configuration of housing units (e.g., studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom) used to meet the requirement for affordable units under this subsection shall be substantially proportional to the mix and configuration of the total housing units in the project.

(iv) When a project includes more than one building with multifamily housing units, all of the affordable housing units required in this subsection must not be located in the same building.

(2) Limits on Exemption. The exemption does not apply:

(a) To the value of land or to the value of non-housing-related improvements not qualifying under this chapter.

(b) In the case of rehabilitation of existing buildings, to the value of improvements constructed prior to submission of the completed application required under this chapter.

(c) To increases in assessed valuation made by the Kitsap County Assessor on nonqualifying portions of building or other improvements and value of land nor to increases made by lawful order of a county board of equalization, the Department of Revenue, or Kitsap County, to a class of property throughout the county or specific area of the county to achieve the uniformity of assessment or appraisal required by law.

(3) Conclusion of Exemption. At the conclusion of the exemption period, the new or rehabilitated housing cost shall be considered as new construction for the purposes of Chapter 84.55 RCW. (Ord. 003-19 § 2; Ord. 023-16 § 2).

(5) “City” means the city of Port Orchard, Washington. (Ord. 1732 § 2, 1998).


3.84.020 Findings.

The city council of the city finds that it is in the city’s best interest to establish a system of registering the ownership of the city’s bonds and obligations in the manner permitted by law. (Ord. 1732 § 3, 1998).


3.84.030 Adoption of registration system.

The city adopts the following system of registering the ownership of its bonds and obligations:

(1) Registration Requirement. All bonds and obligations offered to the public, having a maturity of more than one year, on which the interest is intended to be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, shall be registered as to both principal and interest as provided in this chapter. 

(2) Method of Registration. The registration of all city bonds and obligations required to be registered shall be carried out either by:

(a) A book entry system of recording the ownership of the bond or obligation on the books of the registrar, whether or not a physical instrument is issued; or

(b) Recording the ownership of the bond or obligation and requiring as a condition of the transfer of ownership of any bond or obligation the surrender of the old bond or obligation and either the reissuance of the old bond or obligation or the issuance of a new bond or obligation to the new owner.

No transfer of any bond or obligation subject to registration requirements shall be effective until the name of the new owner and the new owner’s mailing address, together with such other information deemed appropriate by the registrar, are recorded on the books of the registrar.

(3) Denominations. Except as may be provided otherwise by the ordinance authorizing their issuance, registered bonds or obligations may be issued and reissued in any denomination up to the outstanding principal amount of the bonds or obligations of which they are a part. Such denominations may represent all or a part of a maturity or several maturities and on reissuance may be in smaller amounts than the individual denominations for which they are reissued.

(4) Appointment of Registrar. Unless otherwise provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of registered bonds or obligations, the city treasurer shall be the registrar for all registered interest-bearing warrants, installment contracts, interest-bearing leases and other registered bonds or obligations not usually subject to trading without a fixed maturity date or maturing one year or less after issuance and the fiscal agencies shall be the registrar for all other city bonds and obligations with a fixed maturity date or maturing more than one year after issuance.

(5) Duties of Registrar. The registrar shall serve as the city’s authenticating trustee, transfer agent, registrar and paying agent for all registered bonds and obligations for which he, she, or it serves as registrar and shall comply fully with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations respecting the carrying out of those duties.

The rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation of the registrar shall be prescribed in each ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds or obligations, which rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation shall be embodied in a contract executed by the city and the registrar, except that: 

(a) When the fiscal agencies serve as registrar, the city adopts by reference the contract between the State Finance Committee of the state of Washington and the fiscal agencies in lieu of executing a separate contract and prescribing by ordinance the rights, duties, obligations and compensation of the registrar; and 

(b) When the treasurer serves as registrar, a separate contract shall not be required.

In all cases when the registrar is not the fiscal agencies and the bonds or obligations are assignable, the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the registered bonds or obligations shall specify the terms and conditions of:

(i) Making payments of principal and interest;

(ii) Printing any physical instruments, including the use of identifying numbers or other designation;

(iii) Specifying record and payment dates;

(iv) Determining denominations;

(v) Establishing the manner of communicating with the owners of the bonds or obligations;

(vi) Establishing the methods of receipting for the physical instruments for payment of principal, the destruction of such instruments and the certification of such destruction;

(vii) Registering or releasing security interests, if any; and

(viii) Such other matters pertaining to the registration of the bonds or obligations authorized by such ordinance as the city may deem to be necessary or appropriate. (Ord. 1732 § 4, 1998).


3.84.040 Statement of transfer restrictions.

Any physical instrument issued or executed by the city subject to registration under this chapter shall state on its face that the principal of and interest on the bonds or obligations shall be paid only to the owner thereof registered as such on the books of the registrar as of the record date defined in the instrument and to no other person, and that such instrument, either principal or interest, may not be assigned except on the books of the registrar. (Ord. 1732 § 5, 1998).

There is created within the police services budget of the city of Port Orchard a separate line-item to be known as “investigation funding.” Moneys deposited in this line-item shall be used to reimburse police investigation costs, including but not limited to activities related to a defendant’s criminal activity, detection and arrest of the defendant, obtaining evidence for prosecution of the defendant’s case, filing of the defendant’s case, return of the defendant from another jurisdiction, testimony in the defendant’s court case, and/or the recovery from the defendant of lost and stolen property. (Ord. 014-13 § 1; Ord. 1786 § 1, 1999).


3.88.020 Investigation funding assessment. 

In any case where a defendant has been convicted, or receives a deferred sentence of any of the below listed crimes, there shall be, in addition to any fine levied, an assessment in the amount of $50.00, per charge, which shall be deposited into the investigation funding line-item to reimburse police for costs associated with the investigation of the defendant’s case. The fact that this penalty is imposed on each charge shall not in any way reduce the obligation of the defendant to pay any other cost, fine or penalty prescribed by the court. In rendering the assessment, the court shall consider the ability of the defendant to pay pursuant to RCW 10.01.160(3).

(2) “Taxpayer” is any person liable to the license fee or tax imposed by this chapter.

(3) “Tax period or taxable period” are the quarters ending on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st. (Ord. 705 § 2, 1962).

(1) No person shall engage in or carry on any business, occupation, pursuit or privilege for which a license fee or tax is imposed by this chapter without having first obtained and being the holder of, a valid and subsisting license known as an occupation license.

(2) Any taxpayer who engages in or carries on any business subject to the tax imposed by this chapter without having his occupation license is guilty of a violation of this chapter for each day during which the business is engaged in or carried on, and any taxpayer who fails or refuses to pay the license fee or tax on any part thereof on or before the due date shall be deemed to be operating without a license. (Ord. 705 § 3, 1962).


5.04.040 License period.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring a license, or the payment of a license fee or tax, or the doing of any act which would constitute an unlawful burden or interference in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or which would not be consistent with the Constitution or laws of the state.

(2) Any person subject to the payment of a license fee or tax under the provisions of any ordinance of the city, other than this chapter, on account of engaging in any activity for which he is liable to tax under this chapter may deduct the amount of such fee or tax imposed by this chapter on account of such activity, but such person shall nevertheless, in the manner herein provided for, apply for and procure an occupation license.

(Ord. 705 § 9, 1962).


5.04.100 Income records – Returns.

(1) It shall be the duty of each taxpayer taxed upon his gross income to keep and enter in a proper book or set of books or records an account accurately reflecting the amount of his gross income, which account shall always be open to the inspection of the city treasurer or his duly authorized agent, and from which the officer or his agent may verify the return made by the taxpayer.

(Ord. 705 § 11, 1962).

The clerk shall, as soon as practicable, fix a time and place for the hearing of the appeal, which time shall be not more than 10 days after the filing of the notice of appeal, and he shall cause a notice of the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the appellant. At such hearing the taxpayer shall be entitled to be heard and to introduce evidence in his own behalf. The city council shall thereupon ascertain the correct amount of the fee or tax by resolution and the city clerk shall immediately notify the appellant. The amount of the tax, together with costs of the appeal if appellant is unsuccessful therein, must be paid within 30 days after such notice is given.

(2) The mayor may, by subpoena, require the attendance of any person at the hearing of the appeal and may also require him to produce any pertinent books and records.

Upon any telephone business there shall be levied a utility tax equal to six percent of the total gross operating revenues, including revenues from intrastate toll, derived from the operation of such business within the city. Gross operating revenues shall not include charges which are passed on to subscribers by a telephone company pursuant to tariffs required by regulatory order to compensate for the cost to the company of the tax imposed by this chapter. (Ord. 1769 § 3, 1999).


5.08.035 Definitions.

The words and phrases used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise indicates, shall have the following meanings:

(1) “Telephone business” means the business of providing access to a local telephone network, local telephone network switching service, toll service, coin telephone services, telephonic, video, data, pagers, or similar communication or transmission for hire, via a local telephone network, toll line or channel, cable, microwave or similar communication or transmission system. The term includes cooperative or farmer-line telephone companies or associations operating exchanges.

(2) “Telephone business” does not include the providing of competitive telephone service, nor the providing of cable television service, or other providing of broadcast services by radio or television stations.

(3) “Competitive telephone service” means the providing by any person of telecommunications equipment or apparatus, directory advertising and lease of telephone street directories, or service related to that equipment or apparatus such as repair or maintenance service, if the equipment or apparatus is of a type which may be provided by persons not subject to regulation as telephone companies under RCW Title 80, and which a separate charge is made. Transmission of communication through cellular telephones is classified as “telephone business” rather than “competitive telephone service.”

(4) “Cellular telephone service” is a two-way voice and data telephone/telecommunications system based in whole or substantial part on wireless radio communications and which is not subject to regulation by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC).

(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, whenever any person, association, or organization taxable hereunder conducting or operating a taxable activity on a regular basis discontinues operation of that taxable activity for a period of more than four consecutive weeks, or quits business, sells out, or otherwise disposes of its business, or terminates the business, any tax due hereunder shall become due and payable, and such taxpayer shall, within 10 days thereafter, make a return and pay the tax due.

(2) It is recognized that some bona fide charitable or bona fide nonprofit organization taxpayers will be conducting or operating taxable activities only upon an occasional and random basis. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, when such taxpayer conducts only one taxable activity during any calendar quarter, the duration of each such activity does not exceed 15 consecutive calendar days, and the gross receipts therefrom do not exceed $1,500, that taxpayer need not remit the tax due with a return therefor until on or before January 31st of the year following that year in which the activity took place.

(3) Whenever it appears that the collection of taxes from any person, association or organization may be in jeopardy, the city treasurer, after not less than five days’ notice to the taxpayer, is authorized to require that taxpayer to remit taxes and return at such shorter intervals than quarterly or annually, as the city treasurer shall deem appropriate under the circumstances.

The taxpayer shall be required to swear and affirm that the information given in the return is true, accurate and complete.

Failure of the taxpayer to receive such a form shall not excuse a taxpayer from making the return and timely paying all taxes due. The city treasurer shall make forms available to the public during regular business hours.

(3) In addition to the return form, a copy of the taxpayer’s report to the Washington State Gambling Commission as required by WAC Title 230, for the period in which the tax accrued, shall accompany the remittance of the tax amount due. The return, and copy of the report to the Washington State Gambling Commission, shall be filed in the city treasurer’s office after notation by that office upon the return of the amount actually received from the taxpayer.

(2) Taxes imposed under this chapter become a lien upon personal and real property used in the gambling activity in the same manner as provided for under RCW 84.60.010. The lien shall attach on the date the tax becomes due and shall relate back and have priority against real and personal property to the same extent as ad valorem taxes. (Ord. 1790 § 7, 2000).


5.28.080 Failure to make remittance.

(1) If full payment of any tax or fee due under this chapter is not received by the city treasurer on or before the date due, there shall be added to the amount due a penalty fee as follows:

(3) Failure to make payment in full of all tax amounts and penalties within 60 days following the day the tax became due shall be both a civil and criminal violation of this chapter. (Ord. 1790 § 8, 2000).

(b) Bear the actual cost of inspection by any city law enforcement officer or agency at the location at which such books, records, or items are located. A taxpayer choosing to bear these costs shall pay in advance to the city law enforcement officer or agency the estimated cost thereof including, but not limited to, round-trip fare by the most rapid means, lodging, meals and incidental expenses. The actual amount due, or to be refunded, for expenses shall be determined following the examination of the records.

(4) The taxpayer who fails, neglects, or refuses to produce such books and records either within or without this jurisdiction, in addition to being subject to other civil and criminal penalties provided by this chapter, shall be subject to a jeopardy fee.

(2) A tax or other fee has been paid which is less than that properly due, or no tax or other fee has been paid, the city treasurer shall mail a statement to the taxpayer showing the balance due, including the tax amount or penalty assessments and fees. It shall be a separate, additional violation of this chapter, both civil and criminal, if the taxpayer fails to make payment in full within 10 calendar days of such mailing. (Ord. 1790 § 11, 2000).


5.28.120 Failure to make return.

9.09.010 Statement of intent and interpretation.

These standards for public defense services are adopted in order to comply with the requirements of Chapter 10.101 RCW and the Washington State Supreme Court Standards for Indigent Defense (CrRLJ 3.1 Standards). The provisions of these standards shall be broadly and liberally construed to achieve their stated purpose, which is to provide standards which afford “quality representation” in the provision of public defense to indigent criminal defendants. “Quality representation” describes the minimum level of attention, care, and skill that Washington citizens would expect of their state’s criminal justice system. These standards may be amended from time to time to reflect changes in the rules established by the Washington State Supreme Court, the Washington State Bar Association Standard for Indigent Defense Services (WSBA Indigent Defense Standards), or interpretations of the rules and standards by the Washington courts. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.020 Compensation.

The city’s public defender(s) compensation shall be established through negotiation of a contract for defender services. The compensation package should reflect the customary compensation of the community for similar services rendered by other publicly paid attorneys to a public client. The city shall consider training, experience, and the nature and extent of services requested and the time and labor required of the attorney undertaking defender services. Services which require extraordinary fees should be defined in the contract. Among the reasonable expenses to be covered by the contract include expert witnesses, investigative costs, and the administrative overhead costs of paraprofessionals, including, as needed, mental health professionals, social workers, and translators. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.030 Duties and responsibilities of counsel.

(1) Public defense services shall be provided to all clients in a professional, skilled manner consistent with the minimum standards set forth by the American Bar Association, the Washington State Bar Association, the Rules of Professional Conduct, case law and applicable court rules defining the duties of counsel and the rights of defendants in criminal cases. The public defender’s primary and most fundamental responsibility is to promote and protect the interests of the client.

(2) Public defense shall be provided to indigent clients whose eligibility has been determined by court appointment.

(3) All public defenders providing services by contract shall quarterly certify their compliance with the standards for indigent defense by filing a certification of compliance as required by CrRLJ 3.1. Such forms shall be filed with the city of Port Orchard municipal court. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.040 Caseload limits, private practice limits and reporting.

(1) The caseload of the public defender shall consist of misdemeanors and RALJ appeals to superior court. A case is defined as the filing of a document with the court naming a person as a defendant or respondent, to which an attorney is appointed in order to provide representation.

(2) No public defender performing services by contract shall exceed 400 cases in any calendar period. Contracts for services shall prohibit the public defender from performing services under any other similar contract which, taken in conjunction with the services to be performed under the contract, would exceed the case count in any calendar year. The case count for a public defender who maintains a private practice shall be adjusted to reflect the relative percentage which criminal defense relates to the public defender’s total practice. For example, based on an attorney whose practice consists of 50 percent services provided under contract to the city (adjusted for any other public defense services performed for another entity) and 50 percent private practice, the total case count for such an attorney shall not exceed 200 cases.

(3) The request for qualifications process for selection of a public defender and public defender counsel shall strive to obtain a public defender whose experience and training is sufficient to comport with the caseload assumptions and credits assigned. Attorneys assigned to RALJ appeals shall have a minimum of one year’s experience in RALJ appeals or in the event multiple attorneys perform services in the contract, a minimum of one attorney assigned to or supervising RALJ appeals shall have such experience.

(4) The standards provided herein for caseloads may be adjusted up or down depending upon the complexity of any particular case. A public defender may request to have the weighting for an unusually complex case not addressed adequately by these standards increased depending upon the complexity and requirements of the case, and such adjustment shall not be unreasonably refused by the city. The maximum caseload for a particular attorney shall be adjusted downward when the mix of case assignments becomes weighted toward an unanticipated number of more serious offenses or case types that demand more investigation, legal research and writing, use of experts, and/or social workers or other expenditure of time and resources.

(5) If a public defender or assigned counsel is carrying a caseload consisting of cases performed under contract with the city, as well as other criminal cases from other jurisdictions, including a mixed caseload of felonies and misdemeanors, these standards shall be adjusted proportionally to determine a full caseload. If the contract or assigned counsel also maintains a private law practice, the caseload shall be based upon the percentage of time that the lawyer devotes to public defense with the city.

(6) Monthly reports shall be provided by the public defender to the court administrator. The report shall identify the number and type of cases assigned, attorney hours, case disposition, the case count year-to-date, and cases which the public defender has been assigned a higher case count. The public defender case tracking and reporting system shall be maintained independently from client files so as to disclose no privileged information. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.050 Experts and investigators.

(1) A public defense contract shall provide reasonable compensation for an expert of the public defender’s choosing. No appointment shall be from a pre-approved list designated by the city attorney, the city prosecutor, or other city officials. The services of expert witnesses will be provided under contract when approved by the court through ex parte motion. The expert will be paid directly by the city.

(2) Public defense attorneys shall use investigation services as appropriate. The investigator shall have appropriate training and experience in the area of criminal defense and investigations relating to criminal matters. Normally, a ratio of one investigator to four attorneys shall be provided as necessary. Contracts for public defense services shall include investigative services as a part of reimbursed overhead. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.060 Administration and support services.

(1) Contracts for public defense services and proposals submitted in pursuit of such contracts shall provide for or include adequate administrative costs and support, including but not limited to travel, telephones, law library and/or electronic research capabilities, financial accounting, case management systems, computers, word processing equipment and software, office space and supplies. The public defense attorney shall have access to an office that accommodates confidential meetings with clients and a telephone system, Internet access and postal address to ensure prompt response to client contact.

(2) Public defense attorneys shall have adequate support staff to ensure the effective performance of defense counsel. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.070 Qualifications and training.

(1) Every public defender performing services under contract with the city shall satisfy the minimum requirements for practicing law in the state of Washington as determined by the Washington State Supreme Court and possess a license to practice law in the state.

(2) Public defenders performing services under contract shall:

(a) Be familiar with the statutes, court rules, constitutional provisions, and case law relevant to the practice area; and

(b) Be familiar with the Washington Rules of Professional Conduct (WRPC); and

(c) Be familiar with the Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation approved by the Washington State Bar Association; and

(d) Be familiar with the consequences of a conviction or adjudication, including possible immigration consequences and the possibility of civil commitment proceedings based upon a criminal conviction; and

(e) Be familiar with mental health issues and be able to identify the need to obtain expert services; and

(f) Complete seven hours of continuing legal education within each calendar year and courses related to public defense practice; and

(g) Have the opportunity to attend courses that foster trial advocacy skills and to review professional publications and other media; and

(h) Complete and sign the certification form included in the public defense contract. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.080 Supervision, monitoring and evaluation of attorneys.

The city recognizes that smaller firms providing public defense services may provide quality service through experienced practitioners. When applicable, public defenders should make provision for supervision, monitoring and evaluation in accordance with Bar Association standards or provide alternative methods for the supervision, monitoring and evaluation of attorneys which achieve substantially the same goals. Supervision and evaluation efforts should include review of time and caseload records, review and inspection of transcripts, in-court observations, and periodic conferences. Performance evaluations made by a supervising attorney should be supplemented by comments from judges, prosecutors, other defense lawyers and clients. Attorneys should be evaluated on their skill and effectiveness as criminal lawyers or as dependency or civil commitment advocates. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.090 Substitution conflict counsel.

(1) The selection process for a public defender shall be by review of names and experience levels of the attorneys who will actually provide services, to ensure that they meet minimum qualifications. The public defender shall be prohibited from sub-contracting defense services without the express written consent of the city.

(2) In the event of conflict or removal of the public defender, conflict counsel shall be available, either through a joint contract with the public defender and conflict counsel, by separate contract with conflict counsel or by court appointment. In the event that alternative or conflict counsel is required to be assigned, the public defender shall bear no part of the costs associated with the appointment of alternative or sub-conflict counsel. The public defender shall continue representation of clients as necessary upon conclusion of the agreement for public defense services.

(3) Conflict counsel shall adhere to the standards established by this chapter, including but not limited to an evaluation and reporting of the case count under the procedures set forth in the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(4) Conflict counsel may be assigned by the municipal court upon the request of the public defender. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.100 Disposition of client complaints.

The public defender shall provide a method to respond promptly to client complaints. Complaints should first be directed to the attorney, firm or agency which provided representation. If the client feels that he or she has not received an adequate response, the city shall designate a person or agency to evaluate the legitimacy of complaints and to follow up meritorious ones. The complaining client should be informed as to the disposition of his or her complaint within one week. Nothing herein shall bar a client from also filing a complaint with the Washington State Bar Association. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.110 Termination and removal of defender services.

Termination of the contract shall occur for “good cause.” Good cause shall include the failure of the contract public defender to render adequate representation to clients, the willful disregard of the rights and best interests of the client, and the willful disregard of these standards. Termination may also occur for violation of the express terms of the contract, and these standards; provided, however, that the public defender shall be provided reasonable opportunity, following notice, to cure any technical contract violations that do not impair the provision of quality representation to the indigent client. Removal by the court of counsel from representation normally should not occur over the objection of the attorney and the client. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.120 Nondiscrimination.

Neither the city, in its selection of an attorney, firm or agency to provide public defense representation, nor the attorneys selected, in their hiring practices or in their representation of clients, shall discriminate on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation or handicap. Both the city and the contractor shall comply with all federal, state and local nondiscrimination requirements. (Ord. 023-14 § 1).


9.09.130 Guidelines for awarding public defense contracts.

Chapter 9.31 GRAFFITI

Sections:

9.31.010    Definitions.

9.31.020    Graffiti deemed nuisance.

9.31.030    Graffiti prohibited.

9.31.040    Graffiti – Notice of removal.

9.31.050    City costs enforceable – Debt – Lien.

9.31.060    Appeal.

9.31.070    Removal by city.

9.31.080    Civil infraction.


9.31.010 Definitions.

(1) “Enforcement officer” means a law enforcement officer, code enforcement officer or other person or persons appointed by the city council for purposes of enforcing this chapter.

(2) “Graffiti” means the defacing, damaging or destroying by etching, scratching, spraying of paint or marking of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances on public or private buildings, structures, places and property, both real and personal.

(3) “Graffiti abatement procedure” means the abatement procedure, which identifies graffiti, issues notice to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures in absence of response.

(4) “Private contractor” means any person with whom the city shall have duly contracted to remove graffiti.

(5) “Responsible party” means an owner, tenant, or an entity or person acting as an agent for an owner by agreement, who has authority over the property or is responsible for the property’s maintenance or management.

There may be more than one responsible party for a particular property. (Ord. 1894 § 1, 2003).


9.31.020 Graffiti deemed nuisance.

(1) Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.

(2) Although it is appropriate, where possible, to request that the courts require people who are convicted of acts of defacement and vandalism involving application of graffiti to public or private property to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, obtaining convictions for such acts is difficult because the offenses involving graffiti can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the acts are frequently nonexistent.

(3) Although the public should be encouraged to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting the same to the proper authorities, it is also important to eliminate the presence of graffiti from the community so that the product of the illegal acts of those involved in application of graffiti is not visible and the property on which the graffiti is located and surrounding properties do not suffer diminution of value. (Ord. 1894 § 2, 2003).


9.31.030 Graffiti prohibited. 

It shall be unlawful for any person to etch, scratch, write, paint or draw upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage or other structure, tree or other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as “graffiti” within the city without permission from the city. Violation of any of the provisions of this section shall constitute a gross misdemeanor, and may be punished by a fine of up to $5,000 and a jail term not in excess of one year. (Ord. 1894 § 3, 2003).


9.31.040 Graffiti – Notice of removal.

(1) Whenever an enforcement officer determines that graffiti exists on any public or private buildings, structures, places, or other real or personal property which are visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other right-of-way within the city and when weather conditions permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the city engineer or designee shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The responsible party shall have 15 days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city. If the graffiti is on personal property, which is removable from public view (such as an automobile), the responsible party shall have 48 hours to remove the property from public view.

(2) The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be served upon the responsible party of the affected premises by mail at the party’s last known address. The notice shall also be posted at the property. As an alternative to mailing the notice, the enforcement officer may cause a copy of the notice to be personally served in the responsible party in the manner authorized by statute for personal service. The notice shall be in substantially the following form:

NOTICE TO ABATE GRAFFITI

Date:

To:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to Chapter 9.31 of the city of Port Orchard Municipal Code, the city of Port Orchard has determined that there is a graffiti nuisance located on the property commonly known as [address], Port Orchard, Washington, which is visible to public view. You are required, at your own expense, to remove or paint over the graffiti within fifteen (15) days after the date of this notice [or if the graffiti is on removable personal property to remove the personal property from public view within forty eight hours after the date of this notice]; or, if you fail to do so, the city requires the nuisance to be abated by removal or painting over of the graffiti. The cost of the abatement by the city or private contractors employed by the city to abate the nuisance will be assessed upon your property and such costs will constitute a lien upon the land until paid. 

In addition, if the graffiti is not removed or abated by the time specified, the city may begin issuing civil infractions pursuant to Port Orchard Municipal Code Section 9.31.080.

You may appeal this Notice to Abate Graffiti decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the city council of the city of Port Orchard within ten days after the date of this notice.

(Ord. 1894 § 4, 2003).


9.31.050 City costs enforceable – Debt – Lien.

Any and all costs incurred by the city in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance as provided in this chapter shall constitute a debt owed to the city by the responsible party and shall be enforceable as a lien against the property upon which such nuisance existed, in addition to the other legal remedies available for enforcement of debts. (Ord. 1894 § 5, 2003).


9.31.060 Appeal.

Within 10 days from the mailing or from personal service of the notice of intent to remove graffiti, the responsible party or person occupying or managing the premises affected may appeal the matter to the city council. Filing of an appeal will stay, during the pendency of the appeal, any enforcement or actions by the city to abate the graffiti nuisance. (Ord. 1894 § 6, 2003).


9.31.070 Removal by city. 

Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as the enforcement officer approves, then the graffiti may be abated by city forces or by private contract, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter upon the premises for such purposes during regular business hours or at times mutually agreeable with the property owner or occupant. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the city. If the city provides for the removal of the graffiti, it shall not authorize nor undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located. When graffiti is painted over, the city or its private contractor shall attempt to match the paint with the underlying color of the defaced surface. Property owners in the city of Port Orchard may consent in advance to city entry onto private property for graffiti removal purposes. (Ord. 1894 § 7, 2003).


9.31.080 Civil infraction. 

In addition to any other remedy provided in this chapter, any responsible party violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a civil infraction, subject to a civil penalty of $100.00. Each five-day calendar period that a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. (Ord. 1894 § 8, 2003).

In order to protect the health and welfare of all citizens, including workers in their places of employment, it is necessary to prohibit smoking in public places and workplaces. (Ord. 002-07 § 2).

A “public place” does not include a private residence unless the private residence is used to provide licensed child care, foster care, adult care, or other similar social service care on the premises.

Public places include, but are not limited to: schools, elevators, public conveyances or transportation facilities, museums, concert halls, theaters, auditoriums, exhibition halls, indoor sports arenas, hospitals, nursing homes, health care facilities or clinics, enclosed shopping centers, retail stores, retail service establishments, financial institutions, educational facilities, ticket areas, public hearing facilities, state legislative chambers and immediately adjacent hallways, public restrooms, libraries, restaurants, waiting areas, lobbies, bars, taverns, bowling alleys, skating rinks, casinos, reception areas, and no less than 75 percent of the sleeping quarters within a hotel or motel that are rented to guests.

9.44.050 Intent of chapter as applied to certain private workplaces.

This chapter is not intended to regulate smoking in a private enclosed workplace within a public place, even though such workplace may be visited by nonsmokers, excepting places in which smoking is prohibited by the chief of the Washington State Patrol, through the director of fire protection, or by other law, ordinance, or regulation. (Ord. 002-07 § 2).

Any person passing by or through a public place while on a public sidewalk or public right-of-way has not intentionally violated this chapter. Local law enforcement agencies shall enforce this section by issuing a notice of infraction to be assessed in the same manner as traffic infractions. The provisions contained in Chapter 46.63 RCW for the disposition of traffic infractions apply to the disposition of infractions for violation of this subsection, except as follows:

(a) The provisions in Chapter 46.63 RCW relating to the provision of records to the department of licensing in accordance with RCW 46.20.270 are not applicable to this chapter; and

(b) The provisions in Chapter 46.63 RCW relating to the imposition of sanctions against a person’s driver’s license or vehicle license are not applicable to this chapter.

The form for the notice of infraction for a violation of this subsection shall be prescribed by rule of the Supreme Court.

9.44.070 Smoking prohibited within 25 feet of public places or places of employment – Application to modify presumptively reasonable minimum distance.

Smoking is prohibited within a presumptively reasonable minimum distance of 25 feet from entrances, exits, windows that open, and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited, so as to ensure that tobacco smoke does not enter the area through entrances, exits, open windows, or other means. Owners, operators, managers, employers, or other persons who own or control a public place or place of employment may seek to rebut the presumption that 25 feet is a reasonable minimum distance by making application to the director of the local health department or district in which the public place or place of employment is located. The presumption will be rebutted if the applicant can show by clear and convincing evidence that, given the unique circumstances presented by the location of entrances, exits, windows that open, ventilation intakes, or other factors, smoke will not infiltrate or reach the entrances, exits, open windows, or ventilation intakes or enter into such public place or place of employment and, therefore, the public health and safety will be adequately protected by a lesser distance. (Ord. 002-07 § 2).


9.44.080 Fines payable to city.

All fines or forfeitures collected upon enforcement of this chapter shall be paid into the general fund of the city of Port Orchard. (Ord. 002-07 § 2).

The city of Port Orchard is not assuming, nor is it imposing on city personnel, an obligation for breach of which the city or its personnel are liable in money damages. (Ord. 002-07 § 2).

(2) Any person so redeeming a vehicle impounded by the city shall pay the towing contractor for costs of impoundment removal, towing and storage prior to redeeming such vehicle, except as provided for by subsection (3) of this section. Such towing contractor shall accept payment as provided in RCW 46.55.120(1)(b) as now or hereafter amended. If the vehicle was impounded pursuant to POMC 10.72.035 and was being operated by the registered owner when it was impounded, it may not be released to any person until all penalties, fines or forfeitures would by the registered owner have been satisfied.

(3) Either the agency that ordered the vehicle impounded or the Port Orchard municipal court is authorized to release a vehicle impounded pursuant to POMC 10.72.030(4) through (8) prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment. However, the agency may only order early release upon the basis of the following:

(a) A petition of the spouse of the driver based on economic or personal hardship to such spouse resulting from the unavailability of the vehicle and after consideration of the threat to public safety that may result from release of the vehicle including, but not limited to, the driver’s criminal history, driving record, license is authorized; or

(b) The owner of the vehicle was not the driver, the owner did not know that the driver’s license was suspended or revoked, and the owner has not received a prior release under this subsection or POMC 10.72.030(2).

Other than for the reasons for release set forth in subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b) of this subsection, the agency shall deny release in all other circumstances without discretion. The person redeeming the vehicle still must satisfy the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section. The court may waive any or all of the administrative fee.

(4) Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded as a result of a parking or traffic citation has a right to a municipal court hearing to contest the validity of an impoundment or the amount of removal, towing, and storage charges if such request for hearing is in writing, in a form approved by the Port Orchard municipal court and signed by such person, and is received by the Port Orchard municipal court within 10 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the date the notice was given to such person by the registered tow truck operator pursuant to RCW 46.55.120(2) (a). Such hearing shall be provided as follows:

(a) If all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under POMC 10.72.030, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall be released immediately and a hearing as provided in POMC 10.72.050 shall be held within 90 days of the written request for hearing.

(b) If not all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under POMC 10.72.030, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall not be released until after the hearing provided pursuant to POMC 10.72.050, which shall be held within five business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the written request to the court for hearing.

(c) Any person seeking a hearing who has failed to request such hearing within the time specified in subsection (4) of this section may petition the Port Orchard municipal court for an extension of time to file a request for hearing. Such extension shall only be granted upon the demonstration of good cause as to the reason(s) the request for hearing was not timely filed. For purposes of this section, good cause shall be defined as circumstances beyond the control of the person seeking the hearing that prevented such person from filing a timely request for hearing. In the event such extension is granted, the person receiving such extension shall be granted a hearing in accordance with this chapter.

(d) If a person fails to file a timely request for hearing and no extension to file such a request has been granted, the right to a hearing is waived, the impoundment and the associated costs of impoundment are deemed to be proper, and the city shall not be liable for removal, towing, and storage charges arising from the impoundment. (Ord. 1915 § 3, 2003; Ord. 1804 § 5, 2000).


10.72.050 Post-impoundment hearing procedure.

Hearings requested pursuant to POMC 10.72.040 shall be held in the Port Orchard municipal court, which court shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated removal, towing, and/or storage fees were proper.

(1) At the hearing, an abstract of the driver’s driving record is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the status of the driver’s license, permit, or privilege to drive and that the driver was convicted of each offense shown on the abstract. In addition, a certified vehicle registration of the impounded vehicle is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle.

(2) If the impoundment is found to be proper, the court shall enter an order so stating. In the event that the cost of impoundment, removal, towing, and storage have not been paid or any other applicable requirements of POMC 10.72.040(1) and (2) have not been satisfied or any period of impoundment under POMC 10.72.030 has not expired, the court’s order shall also provide that the impounded vehicle shall be released only after payment to the city of any fines imposed on any underlying traffic or parking infraction and satisfaction of any other applicable requirements of POMC 10.72.040(1) and (2).

(3) If the impoundment is found to be improper, the court shall enter an order so stating and order the immediate release of the vehicle. If the costs of impoundment have already been paid, the court shall enter judgment against the city and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment in the amount of the costs of impoundment.    

(4) In the event that the court finds that the impound was proper, but that the removal, towing, storage, fees charged for the impoundment were improper, the court shall determine the correct fees to be charged. If the costs of impoundment have been paid, the court shall enter a judgment against the city and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment for the amount of the overpayment.

(5) No determination of facts made at a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution and such determination shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

(6) As to any impoundment arising from an alleged violation of RCW 46.20.342 or 46.20.420, if it is determined to be improper, then the law enforcement officer directing the impoundment and the government employing the officer are not liable for damages if the officer relied in good faith and without gross negligence on the records of the department in ascertaining that the operator of the vehicle had a suspended or revoked driver’s license.

(xix) Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities and emergency taxi services.

(xx) Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site.

(4) Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ continuing needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other to implement program elements.

(5) Request for Modification of CTR Program Elements. An affected employer may request a modification of the CTR program elements. This request must be in writing and delivered to Kitsap Transit. Such request may be granted by Kitsap Transit if one of the following conditions exists:

(a) Beyond Control. The affected employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program element(s) for which the affected employer seeks an exemption, for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or

(b) Undue Hardship. The affected employer can demonstrate that compliance with the CTR program element(s) would constitute an undue hardship.

Kitsap Transit may ask the employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer’s request.

(6) Exemption from CTR Program.

(a) Exemption from All Requirements. An affected employer may submit a request to Kitsap Transit to grant an exemption from all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular worksite. The employer must demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its work force, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if and only if the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of SOV trips and VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by Kitsap Transit at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program. Kitsap Transit shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. Kitsap Transit shall review annually all employers receiving exemptions and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

(b) Employee Exemptions. Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a worksite’s CTR program. Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. Kitsap Transit will use the criteria identified in the CTR board administrative guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. Kitsap Transit shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. Kitsap Transit shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

(c) Exemption for Variable-Shift Employees. An affected employer may submit a request to Kitsap Transit to exempt specific employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. Kitsap Transit will use the criteria identified in the CTR board guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. Kitsap Transit shall review annually all employee exemption requests and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year. (Ord. 014-08 § 9; Ord. 1760 § 6, 1999).


10.86.080 CTR zone, base year values and goals.

(1) CTR Zone and Values. The city authorizes the board of commissioners of Kitsap Transit to, by resolution, establish the CTR zone(s) boundaries and the base year values for SOV rate and VMT per employee within the CTR zone(s).

(2) Percentage Reductions of SOVs and VMT per Employee. The CTR goals for an affected employer’s CTR program shall be a reduction in the proportion of SOV commute trips and VMT per employee by the percentage set forth in the CTR plan, from the base year values of the CTR zone in which the affected employer is located. The methods used to determine an affected employer’s SOV rate and VMT per employee shall be consistent with the CTR board guidelines (RCW 70.94.537).

(3) Modification of CTR Program Goals. An affected employer may request that Kitsap Transit modify the employer’s CTR goals. Such request shall be filed in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the worksite is required to submit its program description and annual report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the worksite is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The worksite must also demonstrate that it has implemented all the elements contained in its approved CTR program. Kitsap Transit will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR board guidelines. An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one year after Kitsap Transit has approved the employer’s initial program description or annual report. (Ord. 014-08 § 10; Ord. 1760 § 7, 1999).


10.86.090 Credit for commute trip reduction efforts.

(1) Credit for Programs Implemented Prior to the Base Year. Employers with successful transportation demand management (TDM) programs implemented prior to the 1992 base year may be eligible to receive a special one-time CTR program exemption credit, which exempts them from most CTR program requirements. Affected employers wishing to receive this credit must apply to Kitsap Transit within 90 days of the effective date of the initial ordinance codified in this chapter. Application shall include data from a survey of employees or equivalent to establish the applicant’s VMT per employee and proportion of SOV commute trips. The survey or equivalent data shall conform to all applicable standards established in Chapter 2, Section 7, of the state CTR guidelines. An affected employer shall be considered to have met the 1995 CTR goals if their VMT per employee and proportion of SOV commute trips are equivalent to a 12 percent or greater reduction from the base year CTR zone values. These three percentage point credits apply only to the 1995 CTR goals.

(2) Process to Apply for CTR Program Exemption Credit. Affected employers may apply for program exemption credit for the results of past or current CTR efforts by applying to Kitsap Transit in their initial CTR program description or as part of any other annual CTR progress report. Application shall include results from a survey of employees, or equivalent information that establishes the applicant’s VMT per employee and proportion of SOV commute trips. The survey or equivalent information shall conform to all applicable standards established in Section 7 (Survey Guidelines) of the CTR board guidelines. Employers that apply for program exemption credit and whose VMT per employee and proportion of SOV commute trips are equal to or less than the CTR goals for one or more future goal years, and commit in writing to continue their current level of effort, shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter except for the requirements to report performance in 1995, 1997 and 1999. If any of these reports indicate the employer does not satisfy the next applicable CTR goal(s), the employer shall immediately become subject to all requirements of this chapter.

(3) Notice of Leadership Certificate. As public recognition of their efforts, affected employers who meet or exceed the CTR goals as set forth in this chapter will receive a commute trip reduction certificate of leadership from the city. A notice of this certificate of leadership shall be published in the official newspaper. (Ord. 014-08 § 11; Ord. 1760 § 8, 1999).


10.86.100 CTR program review and annual reports.

(1) CTR Program Review.

(a) Approval. Kitsap Transit shall provide the employer with written notification if the employer’s CTR program is deemed acceptable. Such notification shall be by certified mail or delivery, return receipt, addressed to the employer’s employee transportation coordinator. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period or comment on the CTR program within 90 days of submission, the employer’s CTR program or annual report shall be deemed approved. Kitsap Transit may extend the review period up to 90 days. The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.

(b) Conditional Approval. Kitsap Transit may determine that an employer’s CTR program is approved on the condition that certain aspects of the program be modified. In this case, Kitsap Transit shall notify the affected employer of the required modifications. Such notification shall be by certified mail or delivery, return receipt, addressed to the affected employer’s employee transportation coordinator. Affected employers will be given 30 days from the date of such notice to submit a revised CTR program. Kitsap Transit shall have 30 days from the date the revised CTR program is received to accept or reject the revised CTR program.

(c) Rejection. Kitsap Transit shall provide the employer with written notification if the employer’s CTR program is deemed unacceptable and therefore rejected. Such notification shall be by certified mail or delivery, return receipt, addressed to the affected employer’s employee transportation coordinator within 45 days of the CTR program submittal date. The letter will specify the cause(s) for the rejection. Kitsap Transit will schedule a meeting with the affected employer within 21 days of the date of notice. During the meeting, Kitsap Transit will provide technical assistance to the affected employer. The affected employer will be given 30 days from the date of the meeting to submit a revised CTR program. Kitsap Transit shall have 30 days to accept or reject the revised CTR program.

(2) CTR Annual Progress Reports. At a minimum, the employer’s CTR program report and description must include:

(a) A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services;

(e) A statement of organizational commitment to provide appropriate resources to the program to meet the employer’s established goals. (Ord. 014-08 § 12; Ord. 1760 § 9, 1999).


10.86.110 Extensions.

An affected employer may request from Kitsap Transit additional time to submit a CTR program, or CTR annual progress report, or to implement or modify a CTR program. Such requests shall be made in writing and delivered by certified mail to Kitsap Transit no less than 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days may be considered for reasonable cause. Kitsap Transit shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by certified letter, return receipt within 15 days of receiving the request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting the CTR goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any CTR program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s annual reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s annual reporting date may be extended at the discretion of Kitsap Transit. (Ord. 1760 § 10, 1999).


10.86.115 Implementation of employer’s CTR program.

Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than 90 days after receiving written notice from Kitsap Transit that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period, without receiving notice from Kitsap Transit.

(b) Fails to Achieve Either Goal.

(i) With Good Faith Effort. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in this chapter and in RCW 70.94.534(2), but has not met or is not likely to meet the applicable SOV or VMT goal, Kitsap Transit shall work collaboratively with the employer to make modifications to its CTR program. After agreeing on modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description to Kitsap Transit for approval within 30 days of reaching an agreement.

(ii) Without Good Faith Effort. If an employer fails to make a good faith effort, as defined in this chapter and in RCW 70.94.534(2), and fails to meet either the applicable SOV or VMT reduction goal, Kitsap Transit shall work collaboratively with the employer to identify modifications to the CTR program and shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. Kitsap Transit shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program.

(c) The vacation is sought to enable the city to implement a plan, adopted by resolution or ordinance, that provides comparable or improved public access to the same shoreline area to which the streets or alleys sought to be vacated abut, had the properties included in the plan not been vacated.

(2) Before adopting a resolution vacating a street or alley under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the city shall:

12.16.120 Joint trenches.

In requiring undergrounding of electric and telecommunications facilities, it is the city’s intent to authorize and encourage establishment of joint or common trenches, as follows:

(1) Subject to any applicable rates and tariffs, utilization of a single trench where feasible by all utilities and rights-of-way franchise holders is hereby encouraged and shall be required wherever feasible. Upon application for an underground right-of-way use permit, the city’s public works department shall determine whether other utilities and franchise holders have applied, or may be likely to apply on a timely basis, for undergrounding along the same right-of-way and whether the permit, if issued, should require joint use of a common trench. If at the time of application for an underground permit it does not appear that all utilities involved in the undergrounding project have made appropriate arrangements for the use of the common trenches, the public works department may delay the issuance of such permit until all utilities involved in such relocation shall have been given the opportunity to be heard upon two weeks’ notice. 

(2) Where new structures require underground services extending into or across the public right-of-way to existing overhead distribution systems for connection, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner, owner’s agent or other persons applying for such underground service from a power, telecommunications, or cable television utility to provide adequate provisions and capacity for joint usage in a trench with conduit or other required facilities for present and future service extensions to the structure. The utility, property owner, owner’s agent, or other person applying for the permit shall notify all other utilities as to the availability of a common trench (for example, natural gas). The issuance of a permit may be delayed until all utilities involved in a street crossing for underground service connection to a structure have been given the opportunity to be heard upon two weeks’ notice.

(3) Subject to any applicable rates and tariffs, whenever a power, telecommunications, or cable television facility, including but not limited to electrical power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, and fiber optics, is required to be placed underground in a joint trench, then the costs of excavation and fill and also the costs of conduit, cable, vaults, and other appurtenant facilities shall be borne on an equal basis, or as agreed, by the utilities, franchise holders, or others participating in the undergrounding project. (Ord. 030-08 § 7; Ord. 019-07 § 1).


12.16.130 Enforcement.

(1) Any violation of the provisions of this chapter, or any amendments thereto, by any individual or entity shall constitute a civil infraction and any individual or entity committing such infraction shall be subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $1,000 for each violation and for each day upon which any such violation shall continue. The public works director, or designee, shall be responsible for investigation of violations and for enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

(2) To the extent a franchise agreement exists between the city and a utility provider, and to the extent the franchise agreement contains provisions regarding enforcement that encompass the provisions of this chapter, said enforcement provisions of the franchise agreement shall control. (Ord. 030-08 § 8; Ord. 019-07 § 1).


12.16.140 Utility corridors.

(1) The following are designated as utility corridors within the city of Port Orchard. All utilities installed pursuant to this section shall be located within these designated corridors:

(a) For properties north of Bay Street within the central downtown overlay district, as described in POMC Title 20, all utilities shall be located within the city right-of-way fronting those properties.

(b) For properties abutting the south side of Bay Street within the central downtown overlay district, as described in POMC Title 20, and which are west of Sidney Avenue, all utilities shall be located within the city right-of-way along the north side of Prospect Street.

(c) For properties abutting the south side of Bay Street within the central downtown overlay district, as described in POMC Title 20, and which are east of Sidney Avenue, all utilities shall be located within the city right-of-way along the north side of Prospect Alley.

(2) The location of utilities without a designated utility corridor shall be as directed by the public works director.

(3) The public works director may waive the requirements for installation within a designated utility corridor if the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the public works director that such installation constitutes a hazard to persons or property. (Ord. 019-17 § 17; Ord. 030-08 § 9).


12.16.150 Downtown overlay district – Special requirements.

Within the downtown overlay district, as described in POMC Title 20, all transformers, pedestals, vaults and/or handholds shall be installed in such a manner as to avoid being visible or hazardous to the public and shall be either installed underground or inside a building, per utility standards established by the utility provider. A design plan shall be prepared and presented to the director of public works who shall have the authority to approve the location of transformers in accordance with this section. (Ord. 019-17 § 17; Ord. 030-08 § 10).


12.16.160 Cost of conversion – Existing overhead facilities.

The cost and expense of converting existing overhead facilities to underground, installing new facilities underground, and connecting said facilities to buildings, residences and other structures, shall be borne by the serving utilities, the owners or occupants of the real property served, persons applying for such underground service, and/or the city when applicable. The cost for such service shall be in accordance with the applicable tariff files with the WUTC, the rules, regulations, and published policies of the respective utilities furnishing such service, or as may be contractually agreed upon between the utility and such owner or applicant.

12.24.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter shall be:

(1) To maintain the use of city streets for travel, transportation and incidental authorized purposes, and to retain the use of other public places for the purposes established; 

(2) To consider the interests of owners and occupants of property adjacent to public places, while respecting the rights of all users thereof; 

(3) To preserve the appearance of city streets and public places, to carry out design controls in areas subject thereto, encourage improvements that make public places more pleasing; and 

(4) To establish a process for the review, approval, denial and appeal of permits for uses of the public streets, alleys and other public places so as to ensure the protection of the public health, safety and welfare and the prevention of obstructions and/or public nuisances. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.020 Applicability.

This chapter shall authorize, through a temporary, revocable permit, certain limited use of public alleys, places and streets by private individuals. Newsstands are regulated in POMC 12.24.190. This chapter shall not apply to the particular uses of city streets and sidewalks that are regulated by the other chapters of this title. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.030 Nuisances. 

(1) Any structure built or material placed or dumped in or on any public place by anyone, without having first obtained and complied with a permit issued under this chapter, may be declared a public nuisance and abated as set forth in the city’s public works standards or Chapter 7.48 RCW. Other equivalent proceedings may be taken as are authorized by law or city ordinances.

(2) The director may declare that a street tree or any portion of a privately owned tree extending into the right-of-way is a public nuisance if it impacts the safe operations of the transportation system, including but not limited to: impeding signs and signals, or harbors a contagious disease or an insect infestation that threatens the health of other trees or vegetation. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.040 Exceptions.

When required by the United States Constitution or the Washington Constitution or a federal or state statute enacted thereunder, the director shall suspend the application of any particular section of this chapter or waive compliance with a requirement, including payment of fees, the provision of an indemnity deposit or contract, and the furnishing of insurance. The director shall maintain a record of all such granted waivers and suspensions. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.050 Street use permits.

(1) Permit Required. It is unlawful for anyone to make use, as defined in POMC 12.24.210, of any public place: (a) without first securing a written permit as authorized by this chapter; (b) without complying with all conditions of such permit; and (c) without complying with the city’s public works standards. The city public works department is not required to obtain a permit or comply with permit procedures for street maintenance/improvement work performed by the city. 

(2) Review Procedures. A street use permit is exempt from permit processing procedures in the city’s land use regulatory development code (pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140), except where specified within this chapter. The director makes a final decision on the street use permit application without a hearing, which can be administratively appealed as set forth in POMC 12.24.200. Issuance of a street use permit is not a quasi-judicial decision, and the city is not required to hold an open record or closed record hearing (as defined in RCW 36.70B.020) on any decision.

(3) Elements of a Complete Application. A complete street use permit application shall consist of the following: 

(a) Application Form. A completed street use permit application form, including the applicant’s name, address, phone number and email address. If the applicant’s designee is completing the application, then an affidavit signed by the applicant must be submitted, verifying that the applicant has given permission to the designee for the submission of the street use permit application; 

(b) Other Permit Applications. If the street use permit is associated with a proposed project, copies of the related permit applications must be submitted;

(c) Identification of the Public Place. The public place or defined portion of the public place to be used must be identified in detail;

(d) Identification of the Proposed Use. The application must specifically identify the proposed use of the public place, and provide detail on the amount of space required for the proposed use and the dates proposed for such use;

(e) Plans and Specifications. The plans and specifications for any utility or structure proposed in or on the public place; 

(f) Existing Structures. A plan identifying and locating any existing public improvements, utilities, or structures in the area to be used and any trees that may be affected by the proposed use; 

(g) Authorization of Property Owner. When the proposed use involves a structural building overhang, a retaining wall, or a permanent method of lateral support, the application shall also be accompanied by documentation showing the individual or entity that is the record owner of the premises served by the proposed use and showing the record owner of the premises consents to the premises being served by the proposed use;

(h) Fees. The street use permit fee as established by the city in the fee resolution. 

(4) Assurances. Before the city issues any street use permit, the applicant will be required to provide certain assurances (deposit of funds, surety bond, indemnification agreement, etc.), as needed, all as described in POMC 12.24.090 through 12.24.140. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.060 Processing of applications. 

(1) The director shall review each application for a permit for compliance with any applicable codes. 

(2) The director may require additional information or material when he/she deems appropriate, including, but not limited to: a map, photographs, construction plans, or a survey of the site; the director may inspect the premises, solicit comments from other abutters or the public, post or require posting of notice at the site inviting comment to the authorized department, or give notice of the submission of a street use permit application according to requirements for an administrative review in POMC Title 20 for notice of application procedure. 

(3) If an application for a street use permit requires a permit under any other chapter of the city’s code, but the other permit application has not been filed with the appropriate department, then the street use permit application shall be sent to the appropriate director/department for review. The director/department with the authority to review the associated permit applications shall send his/her findings and comments to the director. 

(4) If the director determines that engineering or other studies should be prepared before a permit is approved, the applicant shall prepare the studies, or authorize the city to prepare the studies at the applicant’s expense, before the application will be further processed. (Ord. 019-17 § 17; Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.070 Criteria for approval.

Factors for the director’s consideration in evaluating an application for a permit include, but are not limited to:

(1) The applicant’s constitutional rights;

(2) The impact of the proposed use on the following:

(a) The paramount purpose of streets for travel and transportation;

(b) Utilities; authorized secondary street uses; and any use being made by the public of the site;

(c) Fire access and public safety;

(d) Uses under permit; street trees; and other proposed or past uses of the site;

(e) Rights of light, air, and access and lateral support of abutting properties and on access or easements of properties dependent upon the public place for access;

(f) The environment, including but not limited to efforts to minimize impervious surface, loss of native vegetation, and stormwater runoff;

(g) Drainage, surface and underground; springs and watercourses; and the stability of soils; and

(h) Where applicable, city land use, transportation, open space, shoreline, and beautification policies and approved neighborhood land use plans;

(3) The abutter’s property rights;

(4) The public and private benefits of the proposed use;

(5) The site and its terrain;

(6) In addition to the considerations listed above, where the following situations occur, factors for consideration include:

(a) For public places used as parks or open space, the impact of the proposed use on their character as a park drive or boulevard, or as open space;

(b) For shoreline street ends, their purpose to provide the public with visual or physical access to the water and the shoreline;

(c) For environmentally critical areas, the requirements of POMC Title 20. (Ord. 019-17 § 17; Ord. 043-16 § 4; Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.080 Approval of street use permit.

(1) If the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter, all other applicable codes and the proposed use is consistent with the rights of the public, the director may approve the application; fix the duration and the terms or conditions of the permit; and, when required, upon the applicant’s furnishing of a deposit or surety bond, insurance, covenant, and indemnification (as required by POMC 12.24.090 through 12.24.140), and payment of all required fees, issue the permit. The original permit shall remain in the custody of the city, and a copy shall be given to the permittee and shall be posted or available at the site.

(2) The permit shall specify the portion of the public place that may be occupied, the dates or days and hours of use, and the allowed use. The permit shall only be valid for the portion of the public place, the dates or days and hours of use, and the use as identified on the permit. Every permit shall include the language in POMC 12.24.150(1) on the face of the permit.

(3) Every permit shall be conditioned to state that all activities in the public place shall implement stormwater best management practices (BMPs) in accordance with the city’s current stormwater manual, as amended. Failure to implement stormwater BMPs shall be a violation of this title and subject to enforcement. (Ord. 043-16 § 4; Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.090 Assurances required.

Before the city approves a street use permit, the director shall determine the appropriate assurances (as set forth in POMC 12.24.100 through 12.24.140) as necessary to assist the city in (1) the collection of expenses charged under this chapter and costs associated with a use under a permit; (2) assure performance of the requirements of this chapter and the covenants or conditions in a permit; (3) place on the permittee the risks associated with the use and provide a degree of financial responsibility in the event of an accident or injury; and (4) restoration of the public place when the permittee’s use has been revoked or terminated to at least as good a condition as required by current applicable standards. The city’s acceptance of an indemnity deposit/agreement, establishment of an escrow account, a surety bond, or insurance does not limit an applicant’s or a permittee’s liability to the amount deposited or stated in the instrument. The director, when required to do so by a constitutional provision, or state or federal law, may waive compliance with any of the conditions of POMC 12.24.100 through 12.24.140. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.100 Indemnity deposit with finance department.

(1) If the director determines that there is a substantial risk of injury, damage, or expense to the city or probable city expenditures arising from an applicant’s proposed use of any public place, the director may require the applicant to make an indemnity deposit with the finance director in an amount based on the director’s estimate of the injury, damage, or expense to the city, or cost of restoring the public place if a mishap or accident occurs. 

(2) The establishment of an indemnity deposit with the city shall provide a source of funds, held by the city, to pay probable city expenditures arising from: (a) a proposed use or restoration of the public place after the use; (b) reimbursement of the city for the time associated with city employees’ inspection and code enforcement activities; and (c) ancillary city expenses relating to the permit. Annual street use permit fees are billed separately. A deposit, or escrow account under POMC 12.24.110, establishes a balance with the city in favor of the applicant or permittee against which a city department may deduct fees and charges as they occur, including annual fees and deposits for particular permits. 

(3) The indemnity deposit shall also be used to pay the cost of: (a) restoring the public place; (b) removal of any earth or other debris; (c) replacing or repairing any damaged utility or trees in the public place; (d) completing any work left unfinished; (e) resetting any traffic control devices; (f) performing engineering and other studies required by the applicant’s use of the public place; and (g) any other expense that the city may sustain in conjunction with the permitted work. The deposit shall also be used to pay the city’s administrative expenses equal to the city’s costs for services such as inspections, surveys, preparing plans, letting contracts, and contract administration or supervision. The balance of the cash indemnity deposit, if any, after all such deductions, shall be returned to the applicant or permittee. If the indemnity deposit is insufficient, the applicant or permittee shall be liable for the deficiency. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.110 Escrow account. 

(1) An escrow account (or cash set aside account) differs from a deposit in that the deposit holder, rather than the city, is a public depository; interest on the deposit accrues to the account, rather than to the city; and withdrawals from the account are governed by the escrow agreement rather than by city rules on guaranty deposits. The director may accept the establishment of an escrow account in a qualified public depository as defined in Chapter 39.58 RCW that is eligible to receive city moneys as a substitute for: 

(a) Making all or part of an indemnity deposit required by POMC 12.24.100 if the amount involved equals or exceeds $1,000 and the terms of the escrow authorize the deduction and payment to the city of charges identified in POMC 12.24.100; or 

(b) Filing a surety bond required by POMC 12.24.120 if the amount involved is $10,000 or less and, in the event of the applicant’s or permittee’s default, the authorizing official anticipates that the city could reasonably complete the work needed to protect the public and restore the public place for the amount placed in the escrow account. 

(2) The director shall require that the escrow account be established using the city’s form, which is approved by the city attorney. Interest accruing in the escrow account shall be added to the principal account and the balance after deductions returned to the applicant or permittee. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.120 Surety bond. 

(1) A surety bond provides a promise by a licensed surety company, within the limits and according to the terms of the bond, to perform work or pay the city’s expenses to perform the work in the event of the permittee’s default. A surety bond is not a substitute for providing the city public liability insurance for any tortious injury. The director may authorize the filing of a surety bond consistent with the procedures in this chapter, in lieu of making all or part of an indemnity deposit.

The bond shall run for the full period of the permit plus two years after city acceptance of the permitted work. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.130 Liability insurance. 

(1) Liability insurance protects the city as an additional insured from public liability as a result of an accident, injury, or damage arising from the use of a public place; and assists in making permittees financially responsible for meeting liabilities that may arise from their use of public places. 

(2) Every permittee, as a condition of every street use permit, shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, public liability insurance in an amount sufficient to protect the city from all potential claims and risks of loss from perils in connection with any activity that may arise from or be related to the permittee’s activity upon or the use or occupation of the public place allowed by the permit and claims and risks in connection with activities performed by the permittee by virtue of the permission granted by the permit. The insurance policy shall: (a) be in effect for the duration of the permit; name the city of Port Orchard, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, and agents as additional insureds for primary and noncontributory limits of liability subject to a separation of insureds clause; (b) apply as primary insurance regardless of any insurance that the city may carry; and obligate the insurance company to give notice to both the director and the city clerk at least 30 calendar days before any cancellation of the policy. 

(3) The director, in consultation with the city attorney, shall establish the amount of the insurance, and unless constitutional liberties prohibit it, shall require that the insurance be provided prior to issuance of the permit. The city requires insurance coverage to be placed with an insurer admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State or with a surplus lines carrier according to Chapter 48.15 RCW, except that if it is infeasible to obtain coverage with the required insurer, the city may approve an alternative insurer. Evidence of such insurance shall be provided before the city issues the street use permit. (Ord. 022-16 § 2).

(a) Any liability, claims, actions, suits, loss, costs, expense judgments, attorneys’ fees, or damages of every kind and description resulting directly or indirectly from any act or omission of the permittee, its subcontractors, anyone directly or indirectly employed by them, and anyone for whose acts or omissions they may be liable, arising out of the permittee’s use or occupancy of the public place; and 

(b) All loss by the failure of the permittee to fully or adequately perform, in any respect, all authorizations of obligations under permit. 

(2) If the application is for a permit to use or occupy a public place with a bulkhead, steps, retaining wall, rockery, structure, or an extension or appurtenance to a structure or any facility with an anticipated continued occupancy of a public place of more than one year, the owner of the adjacent property, and any existing lessee, sublessee, tenant and subtenant using or occupying the part of the premises served or connected to the permitted use, shall, in the manner provided by law for the execution of deeds, execute and deliver to the city upon a form to be supplied by the authorizing official an agreement in writing: signed and acknowledged by the owners and by any existing lessee, sublessee, tenant and subtenant; containing an accurate legal description of the premises; covenanting on the part of the owner, lessee, sublessee, tenant and subtenant, for themselves and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, lessees, sublessees, tenants and subtenants and forever defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless the city, its officials, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense, attorneys’ fees, or damages of every kind and description, excepting only damages that may result from the sole negligence of the city, that may accrue to, be asserted by, or be suffered by any person or property, including, without limitation, damage, death, or injury to members of the public or to the permittee’s officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants’ invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns, arising out of or by reason of: 

(a) The existence, condition, construction, reconstruction, modification, maintenance, operation, use, or removal of the permitted area or any portion thereof, or the use, occupation, or restoration of the public place or any portion thereof by the owner, lessee, sublessee, tenant and subtenant, heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, lessees, sublessees, tenants and subtenants; 

(b) Anything that has been done or may at any time be done by the owner, lessee, sublessee, tenant and subtenant, heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, lessees, sublessees, tenants and subtenants by reason of the permit; or 

(c) The owner, lessee, sublessee, tenant and subtenant, heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, lessees, sublessees, tenants and subtenants failing or refusing to strictly comply with every provision of the permit; or arising out of or by reason of the permit in any other way. 

(3) The director may require that the indemnification agreements for the types of structures identified in subsection (2) of this section shall be a covenant running with the land and shall be recorded against the property at the applicant’s cost. 

(4) In addition, the agreement shall contain a provision which expressly states that the permit:

(a) Is wholly of a temporary nature;

(b) Vests no permanent right whatsoever;

(c) May be revoked, the structures and obstructions removed, and public place restored to the condition that existed prior to use occurring in the public place upon 30 calendar days’ notice, posted on the premises, or published in the official newspaper of the city; or without notice, if the permitted use is dangerous or the structures are insecure or unsafe, as determined by the director, or are not constructed, maintained, or used in accordance with the Port Orchard Municipal Code. 

(5) An agreement after it has been received and recorded with the county auditor shall be retained by the city clerk in the files and records of the clerk’s office. 

(6) The director may waive execution of the signature on an agreement by a tenant or subtenant on a month-to-month lease or on a tenancy at will.

The fee shall be collected as a condition to issuing or continuing any permit or use. (Ord. 020-18 § 4; Ord. 022-16 § 2).


12.24.170 Exception/waiver, fees and assurances. 

(1) The director may grant an exception from paying fees, making an indemnity deposit, posting a surety bond, or providing liability insurance from the United States of America. 

(2) The authorizing official may grant an exception from paying fees, making an indemnity deposit, posting a surety bond, or providing liability insurance when the primary purpose of the project is environmental remediation and the project is being conducted in compliance with 42 U.S.C. 9621 and is subject to 42 U.S.C. 9621(e). 

(3) The authorizing official may grant an exception from paying fees, making an indemnity deposit, posting a surety bond, or providing liability insurance when the use is for a public transportation-related-infrastructure project, like light rail, and is authorized under a separate ordinance; or when the use is for a city transportation project.

13.04.010 Bimonthly water rates. 

Water rates are based on a bimonthly schedule and are a function of size of service plus consumption.

(1) Effective January 1, 2016, and January 1st of each subsequent year shown, the water rates, as calculated bimonthly, are shown on the water rate table.

(a) Single Connections. Single connections are where one customer is being served through a master meter and the billing is based on the flow through such master meter. The minimum bimonthly base rate is shown on the water rate table, plus consumption charges for water usage in excess of 5,000 gallons are set forth in subsection (1)(c) of this section.

(b) Larger Meters. Base rate for the first 5,000 gallons is calculated based on the size of service plus the meter size cost difference as shown on the water rate table. Consumption charges for water usage in excess of 5,000 gallons are set forth in subsection (1)(c) of this section.

(c) Consumption charges in excess of 5,000 gallons allotted per customer will be charged in the five tiers as shown in the water rate table.

(d) Multiple Connections. Multiple connections are where more than one customer is being served through a master meter and the billing is based on the flow through such master meter. The minimum bimonthly base rate is determined by the number of customers multiplied by the base rate plus the difference in cost between three-fourths-inch service and the actual meter size.

13.04.030 Water capital facility charge – Extension of water.

(1) The water capital facility charge is designed to mitigate the impact of new demands on the existing water system and to require new users to pay their fair share of the value of the water system including, but not limited to, water supply, treatment, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. The water capital facility charge applies to new construction, changes in use, and building modifications which increase the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs). An ERU is 180 gallons per day for nonresidential connections. Prior to connecting to the city’s water system the property owner shall pay, in addition to other applicable charges, the applicable water capital facility charge.

(a) The water capital facility charge for a residential connection is based on a set fee per ERU which is set forth in POMC 13.04.025. An ERU for this purpose shall be computed based on the water meter size and shall be calculated according to the average flow factor of a displacement type meter where a three-quarter-inch meter shall have a flow factor equal to one ERU. An ERU for residential connections is one single-family dwelling unit, whether detached or attached and configured as an apartment unit, condominium unit, townhouse unit, or any other configuration.

(b) The water capital facility charge for a nonresidential connection shall be calculated based on meter size as set forth in POMC 13.04.025.

(c) Per Resolution No. 1666, the city treasurer is authorized to waive the connection fee of the water systems which do not impact the fire flow storage requirements of the city. All other fees, charges and expenses shall be paid as in accordance with this chapter. Examples of these connections are irrigation systems, fire protection systems, and relocating service lines which cross private property.

(2) If, after connection of a nonresidential service, the actual water usage has increased or the property use expanded so that there are a greater number of ERUs being used on the property than for which the water capital facility charge was paid, the property owner shall pay to the city an additional water capital facility charge based upon the new or expanded use. The additional water capital facility charge shall be based upon the charge rate in effect at the time the increase in use is requested and/or detected, whichever first occurs.

(3) Water Capital Facility Charge – Exception. The following exception applies to the assessment of the water capital facility charge. All four elements of the below-listed requirements must be present to qualify for the exception:

(a) A nonresidential account paid the water capital facility charge at the time the property connected to the city’s water system;

The credit shall be equal to that portion of the property owner’s principal assessment, not including interest and penalties, which is directly applicable to the construction of the improvements that are a basis for calculating the value of the capital facility charge. The credit shall be applied at the time of payment of the water capital facility charge and shall not be used to reduce any assessments in the local improvement district.

(5) A credit against the water capital facility charge may be applied for those property owners that construct at their own expense any of the improvements that are a basis for calculating the value of the water capital facility charge or for those property owners that pay a latecomer’s fee toward those same improvements. The credit shall be the smaller of the following:

13.04.040 Sewer capital facility charge – Extension of sewer.

(1) The sewer capital facility charge is designed to mitigate the impact of new demands on the existing sewer system and to require new users to pay their fair share of the value of the sanitary sewer system. The sewer capital facilities charge applies to new construction, changes in use, and building modifications that increase the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs). An ERU is 180 gallons per day for nonresidential connections. An ERU for residential connections is one single-family dwelling unit, whether detached or attached and configured as an apartment unit, condominium unit, townhouse unit or any other configuration. The ERU consumption is based upon metered water consumption or comparison to similar accounts when metered water consumption data is not readily available.

(a) Sewer Capital Facility Charge – Exception. The following exception applies to the assessment of the sewer capital facility charge. All four elements of the below-listed requirements must be present to qualify for the exception:

(i) A nonresidential account paid the sewer capital facility charge at the time the property connected to the city’s sewer system;

(ii) Sometime after the original connection, the property owner decides to construct a new building, change the original use, or modify the original building;

(iii) After the building improvements are completed, the total sewer usage for the nonresidential account will be equal to or less than the usage at the time of the original connection; and

(iv) The new construction, change in use, or building modification has not resulted in additional direct connection to the city’s sewer system or the establishment of an additional sewer account.

(2) The sewer capital facility charge consists of two components: the general facility fee and the wastewater treatment facility fee. The general facility fee and the wastewater treatment facility fees are set forth in POMC 13.04.025. The properties within Divisions 1 through 10, inclusively, of the McCormick Woods Land Company shall have a wastewater treatment fee which is set forth in POMC 13.04.025.

(3) The sewer capital facility charge shall be paid before connecting to the city sanitary sewer system, or before changing the use, or increasing the total ERU count above the amount for which a sewer capital facility charge has been paid. If work is to be done that requires a sewer capital facility charge, it shall be paid before a permit shall be issued.

(4) If, after connection of a nonresidential service, the actual sewer usage has increased or the property use expanded so that there are a greater number of ERUs being used on the property than for which the sewer capital facility charge was paid, the property owner shall pay to the city an additional sewer capital facility charge based upon the new or expanded use. The additional sewer capital facility charge shall be based upon the charge rate in effect at the time the increased use is requested and/or detected, whichever first occurs.

(5) A credit against the sewer capital facilities charge may be applied for those property owners that paid their assessments in full through a local improvement district formed by the city, where such local improvement district is formed to finance the construction of any of the improvements that are a basis for calculating the value of the sewer capital facilities charge. The credit shall be equal to the amount of the property owner’s principal assessment, not including interest and penalties. The credit shall be applied at the time of payment of the sewer capital facilities charge and shall not be used to reduce any assessments in the local improvement district.

(6) A credit against the sewer capital facilities charge may be applied for those property owners that construct at their own expense any of the improvements that are a basis for calculating the value of the sewer capital facilities charge or for those property owners that pay a latecomer’s fee toward those same improvements. The credit shall be the smaller of the following:

(a) That portion of the design and construction costs of a latecomer’s agreement that is directly applicable to the construction of the improvements that are a basis for the value of the sewer capital facilities charge; or

(b) That proportionate amount of the sewer capital facilities charge that is attributable to the sewer facilities either constructed by the property owner or paid through a latecomer’s fee.

(7) The above provisions notwithstanding, the amount of credit shall not exceed the amount of the sewer capital facilities charge for the property to which the credit is being applied.

(8) At the time the sewer capital facilities charge is paid, a sewer inspection fee shall be paid per lateral connection to the main. The sewer inspection fee is set forth in POMC 13.04.025.

(9) All materials shall comply with the requirements of the city. If the city supplies any materials, the cost of these plus overhead and sales tax will be paid by the customer.

(10) Extension of Sewer to Property Contiguous to the City Shall Annex – Exception. Property lying within the urban growth boundary and contiguous to the Port Orchard city limits shall annex to the city as a condition of sewer connection. In the alternative, the city may elect to defer annexation and require the owner to execute a utility extension agreement as described in subsection (11) of this section.

(11) Requirement for Utility Extension Agreement.

(a) Property lying within the urban growth area which is not contiguous to the Port Orchard city limits shall be permitted water and/or sewer connection only upon entering into an appropriate agreement with the city containing a waiver of protest to annexation/limited power of attorney authorizing annexation at such time as the city determines the property should be annexed to the city. Application for extension of utilities is subject to the following provisions:

(i) Application fees as established by the city council shall be paid upon the submittal of a signed utility extension agreement (UEA) requesting water and/or sewer for property outside the city, but located within the urban growth area;

(ii) The applicant will bear the entire cost of water and/or sewer connection pursuant to this chapter, as written or hereafter amended, subject to any provision in effect at the time of connection for latecomer reimbursement;

(iii) The applicant will be subject to all applicable provisions of this chapter, as written or hereafter amended, for extension of city utilities, the payment therefor, and all enforcement provisions therein; and

(iv) The UEA shall not be executed prior to the time formal application is made for approval of the project for which utilities are requested. The term of said agreement shall terminate at the time any project application or approval expires or is revoked for any reason. A new agreement shall also be required for any extension of project application or approvals or when the director of planning determines that a substantial change or addition has been made to the project.

(b) The city may disconnect the utilities for failure of the applicant or his/her successors or assigns, for violation of this chapter, or for violation of the terms and conditions of the UEA.

(c) Following execution, such agreement shall be recorded by the city clerk in the chain of title for such property in the records of the Kitsap County auditor. (Ord. 020-15 § 7; Ord. 008-13 § 4; Ord. 027-11 § 5; Ord. 013-08 § 9; Ord. 023-06 § 2; Ord. 010-05 § 5; Ord. 1897 § 5, 2003; Ord. 1799 § 5, 2000).

(4) If the delinquent water and/or sewer charges remain unpaid over a period of 30 days after the due and payable date, service will be discontinued by turn-off. Service will not resume thereafter until the delinquent charges and penalties, together with a turn-off fee, have been paid in full. The turn-off fee shall be set forth in POMC 13.04.025.

(a) It is unlawful for the owner or occupant of the premises to turn on/off the water, cause damage, or cause it to be turned on after it has been shut off or locked by the city. The above charges under this subsection (4) will apply if the city has to return to re-shut off an account that is supposed to be turned off at the meter for nonpayment. Violations will result in a fee as determined by the city which is set forth in POMC 13.04.025.

(b) In the event of a declared state of emergency, due to a natural disaster, weather or public health emergency, the city treasurer is authorized to suspend disconnection of water and/or sewer services and to waive turn-off fees for the duration of the declared emergency. All other fees and charges shall continue to accrue.

(5) Where both water and sewer delinquent charges are involved, the customer shall not be billed double penalties.

(6) In the event of a declared local state of emergency, due to a natural disaster, weather or public health emergency, the city treasurer is authorized to suspend disconnection.

The cost of construction shall be documented in writing by the developer on final invoices or other documents showing the amounts paid by the developer/owner. The city will not accept written estimates in determining the cost of construction. In the event of a disagreement between the city and the developer/owner concerning the cost of the water and/or sewer facilities, the city public works director’s decision shall be final.

(2) “Developer” or “owner” means a property owner or authorized agent of the property owner who may construct a water and/or sewer facility, and desires a latecomer agreement under the terms and conditions set forth in this chapter. The city or the county may be a “developer” or “owner” under this chapter.

The latecomer agreement shall be a standard contract approved as to form by the city attorney. Where the city constructs water or sewer facilities under a latecomer agreement, the agreement may provide for the total reimbursement of the cost of construction of the water and/or sewer facilities. 

(4) “Latecomer fee” means a charge collected by the city, whether separately stated or as part of a connection fee for providing access to the city’s water and/or sewer system, against a real property owner who connects to, hooks up to or uses a water or sewer facility subject to a latecomer agreement created under this chapter and Chapter 35.91 RCW.

(5) “Latecomer” means a property owner not a party to a duly executed and recorded latecomer agreement, owning property in the area benefitted by such agreement, who seeks to connect to the water and/or sewer facilities constructed under the latecomer agreement within the time frame established in the agreement, and who many only do so by making payment to the city of his/her pro rata share of the cost of construction. 

(6) “Water or sewer facilities” means storm, sanitary, or combination sewers, pumping stations and disposal plants, water mains, hydrants, reservoirs or appurtenances. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).

At the developer’s request, the city must contract with the owner of real estate for the construction or improvement of water or sewer facilities that the owner elects to install solely at the owner’s expense. However, the city is only required to enter into such a contract if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) The latecomer agreement must be for the construction of water and/or sewer facilities in locations where the city’s ordinances require such facilities to be improved or constructed as a prerequisite to further property development; and

(2) The water and/or sewer facilities to be improved or constructed must be located within the city’s corporate limits, or within 10 miles of the city’s corporate limits; and

(3) If Kitsap County is a party to the latecomer agreement, the water and/or sewer facilities may not be located outside the county; and

(4) The latecomer agreement shall meet all of the conditions required by the city under this chapter, and shall be filed and recorded with the county auditor; and

(5) The water and/or sewer facilities must be consistent with all applicable comprehensive plans and development regulations of the municipalities through which the facilities will be constructed or will serve; and

(6) The sewer and/or water facilities to be constructed or improved must be included in the city’s comprehensive plan. Unless the city provides written notice to the owner of its intent to request comprehensive plan approval for the facilities, the owner must request comprehensive plan approval for the water and/or sewer facility; and 

(7) The owner shall submit the total cost of the water or sewer facility to the city, within 120 days of the completion of the water or sewer facility, so that the city may use this information as the basis for determining the reimbursements by future users who benefit from the water or sewer facility, but who did not contribute to the original cost of the water or sewer facility. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.040 City or county participation in latecomer agreements.

(1) If authorized by ordinance or contract, the city or county may participate in financing water or sewer facilities development projects that are authorized and improved or constructed in accordance with POMC 13.08.030. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance or contract, the city or the county participating in the financing of water or sewer facilities improved or constructed under this chapter:



(a) Shall have the same rights to reimbursement as owners of real estate who make contributions as authorized under this section; and

(b) Are entitled to a pro rata share of the reimbursement based on the respective contributions of the owner and the city/county.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the city or county seeking reimbursement from an owner of real estate subsequently connecting to the water and/or sewer facilities constructed under this section is limited to the dollar amount authorized in the resolution contemplated in subsection (3) of this section. This does not prevent the city or county from collecting amounts for services or infrastructure that are additional expenditures not subject to the ordinance, contract or agreement, nor does it prevent the collection of fees that are reasonable and proportionate to the total expenses incurred by the city or county in complying with this section.

(3) To the extent that it may require in the performance of the latecomer agreement, the city or county may install the water or sewer facilities in and along the city or county streets in the area to be served as hereinabove provided, subject to reasonable requirements as the manner of occupancy of the streets as the city or county may by resolution provide. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.050 Effect, duration, reimbursement of pro rata share.

(1) The provisions of the latecomer agreement may not be effective as to any owner of real estate not a party thereto unless the latecomer agreement has been recorded in the office of the county auditor of the county in which the real estate of the owner is located, prior to the time the owner taps into or connects to the water or sewer facilities.

(2) The latecomer agreement shall provide for the pro rata reimbursement to the owner or the owner’s assigns for 20 years. The agreement may provide for an extension of the 20-year reimbursement period for a time not to exceed any moratorium, phasing ordinance, concurrency designation or other governmental action that prevents making applications for, or the approval of, any new development within the benefit area for a period of six months or more. Upon the extension of the reimbursement period pursuant to this section, the agreement must specify the duration of the contract extension and must be filed and recorded with the county auditor. Property owners who are subject to the reimbursement obligations in the latecomer agreement shall be notified by the contracting municipality of any extension filed under this section.

(3) The contracting municipality shall reimburse the developer/owner from latecomer fees received by the contracting municipality from property owners in the benefitted area who subsequently connect to or use the water or sewer facilities, but who did not contribute to the original cost of the facilities. The reimbursement of the pro rata share must be made by the contracting municipality within the period of time that the latecomer agreement is effective. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.060 Conditions imposed on and included in latecomer agreements.

Every latecomer agreement shall include the following conditions:

(1) The water or sewer facility shall be constructed by the developer/owner according to plans and specifications approved by the city;

(2) The water or sewer facility shall be inspected and approved for ownership and maintenance by the city;

(3) The developer/owner shall transfer the water and/or sewer facility to the city with a bill of sale, without cost to the city, at the time the city approves the facility for ownership and maintenance;

(4) The developer/owner shall comply with all of the owner’s obligations under the latecomer agreement and the applicable city rules and regulations;

(5) The developer/owner shall provide sufficient security to the city to ensure completion of the water and/or sewer facility and compliance with other performance measures under the contract;

(6) The developer/owner shall pay all of the city’s costs associated with the water or sewer facility including, but not limited to, engineering, legal and administrative costs;

(7) The city shall verify and approve all contracts and cost of construction related to the water and/or sewer facility;

(8) The agreement shall include a provision requiring that, every two years from the date the agreement was executed, the developer/owner entitled to reimbursement shall provide the municipality with information regarding the current contact name, address and telephone number of the person, company, or partnership that originally entered into the latecomer agreement. If the owner fails to comply with the notification requirements of this subsection within 60 days of the specified time, then the contracting municipality may collect any reimbursement funds owed to the property owner under the agreement. The funds collected under this subsection must be deposited in the capital fund of the municipality. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.070 Preliminary determination of latecomer benefitted area.

The city public works director shall determine whether a request for a latecomer agreement satisfies the requirements in POMC 13.08.030. If the request satisfies the requirements, the director shall define the latecomer assessment area, based upon a determination of the locations in which the city’s ordinances require the facilities to be improved or constructed as a prerequisite to further property development, as well as a review of the applicable comprehensive plan(s). The director shall also review the owner’s calculations relating to the cost of construction, the amount of the proposed latecomer fee and the receipts and invoices relating to the construction of the water and sewer facilities. The amount of the pro rata share to be paid under the latecomer agreement shall be recommended by the owner, so that each property within the latecomer benefitted area will be assessed a share of the costs of the improvements which is proportional to the benefits which accrue to the property. The methodology utilized in calculating the amount of the pro rata share shall be the responsibility of the owner. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.080 Notice – Hearing – Consideration by city council.

(1) Upon the public works director’s recommendation that the request for the latecomer agreement meets the requirements of this chapter, the city shall prepare a latecomer agreement for inclusion in the council agenda after the time period established in subsection (3) of this section.

(2) The preliminary determination of the benefitted area boundaries and the proposed pro rata share, along with the property owners’ rights and options, shall be forwarded by certified mail to the property owners of record within the proposed benefitted area shown on the records of the county assessor.

(3) If any property owner requests a hearing within 20 days of the mailing date of the preliminary determination, a hearing shall be held before the city council, notice of which shall be given to all affected property owners by mail not less than 10 days prior to the hearing. After considering public testimony at the hearing, the city council shall make a final determination of the latecomer benefitted area and the pro rata share, based on the criteria set forth in this chapter and as specified in Chapter 35.91 RCW. The council may adopt, reject or modify the city public works director’s recommendation. The final determination of the latecomer benefitted area and pro rata share shall be established by ordinance.

(4) In the event that no hearing is requested, the city public works director’s recommendation of the latecomer assessment area and pro rata share shall be final.

(5) The latecomer agreement, request and supporting documents, along with the public works director’s determination of cost of construction, latecomer benefitted area and pro rata share shall be presented to the city council for consideration. If the latecomer agreement meets the requirements of this chapter, the city council may modify or approve the latecomer agreement. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.090 Method for determining pro rata share.

The developer/owner may propose any method for determining the pro rata share. For example, the method of assessment permitted for local improvement district assessment, including, but not limited to, the front-foot method, the zone and termini method, and square footage method, may be proposed. The city may, in its discretion, determine the method for determining the pro rata share used to calculate the latecomer fee and the city’s decision on the method shall be final. The fair pro rata share of the cost of the water and/or sewer facilities attributable to the developer/owner’s property shall be deducted from the cost of construction. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.100 Approval and acceptance of facilities.

Upon the completion of water or sewer facilities pursuant to a latecomer agreement, the city council shall be authorized to approve their construction and accept the water and/or sewer facilities for ownership and maintenance. The city may then charge for their use such water or sewer rates that the city is authorized by law to establish. All further maintenance and operation costs shall be borne by the city. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.110 Contract payment made prior to hook-up.

A person, firm or corporation may not be granted a permit or be authorized to tap into or use any such water or sewer facilities or extensions subject to a latecomer agreement during the period of time prescribed in the latecomer agreement without first paying to the city, in addition to any and all other costs and charges made or assessed for such tap or use, or for the water lines or sewers constructed in connection therewith, the amount required by the provisions of the applicable latecomer agreement. All amounts so received by the city shall be paid out by it under the terms of the latecomer agreement to the developer/owner within 60 days after the receipt thereof. Whenever any tap or connection is made into any water or sewer facilities subject to a latecomer agreement without such payment having first been made, the city council may authorize the removal, or cause to be removed, such unauthorized tap or connection and all connecting tile or pipe located in the facility right-of-way, and dispose of unauthorized material so removed, without any liability whatsoever. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).


13.08.120 No city liability.

Nothing in this chapter is intended to create a private right of action for damages against the city or any municipality for failing to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The city, its officials, employees or agents may not be held liable for failure to collect a latecomer fee unless the failure was willful or intentional. Failure of the city to comply with the requirements of this chapter does not relieve the city of any future requirements to comply with this chapter. (Ord. 002-15 § 1).

Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards. The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited.

Examples of pollutants include, but are not limited to, the following: trash or debris; solid waste; construction materials; petroleum products including, but not limited to, oil, gasoline, grease, fuel oil, heating oil; antifreeze and other automotive products; fixed and mobile vehicle washes; metals in either particulate or dissolved form in excess of naturally occurring amounts; flammable or explosive materials; radioactive materials; batteries; acids, alkalis, or bases; paints, stains, resins, lacquers, or varnishes; degreasers or solvents; drain cleaners; commercial and household cleaning materials; carpet cleaning wastes; pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers; steam cleaning wastes; laundry waste; soaps, detergents, or ammonia; swimming pool or spa filter backwash (diatomaceous earth); swimming pool cleaning wastewater; chlorine, bromine, and other disinfectants; heated water; chlorinated swimming pool or hot tub water; human and animal wastes; domestic or sanitary sewage; recreational vehicle waste; animal carcasses; food and food wastes; yard waste; bark and other fibrous materials (does not include large woody debris in approved restoration projects); collected lawn clippings, leaves, or branches; wastes associated with building construction; concrete and concrete by-products; silt, sediment, including dirt, sand, and gravel; dyes and ink (except as stated in subsection (2)(e) of this section); chemicals not normally found in uncontaminated water; any other process-associated discharge except as otherwise allowed in this section; and any hazardous material or waste not listed above.

(2) Conditional Discharges. The following types of discharges shall not be considered illicit discharges for the purposes of this chapter if they meet the stated conditions or unless the director determines that the type of discharge, whether singly or in combination with others, is causing or is likely to cause pollution of surface water or groundwater: 

(a) Discharges from potable water sources, including water line flushing, hyper-chlorinated (> 10 mg/liter chlorine) water line flushing, fire hydrant system flushing, and pipeline hydrostatic test water. Planned discharges shall be dechlorinated to a total residual chlorine concentration of 0.1 ppm or less, pH-adjusted if necessary, and volumetrically and velocity controlled to prevent re-suspension of sediments in the stormwater system; 

(b) Discharges from lawn watering and other irrigation runoff; however, these shall be minimized through water conservation efforts; 

(c) Dechlorinated spa or swimming pool discharges. The discharges shall be dechlorinated to a total residual chlorine concentration of 0.1 ppm or less, pH-adjusted and reoxygenized if necessary, and volumetrically and velocity controlled to prevent resuspension of sediments in the stormwater system. Discharges shall be thermally controlled to prevent an increase in temperature of the receiving water. Swimming pool cleaning wastewater and filter backwash shall not be discharged to the storm drainage system; 

(d) Street and sidewalk wash water, water used to control dust, and routine external building wash down that does not use detergents. The amount of street wash, dust control, and building wash water shall be minimized. At active construction sites, street sweeping must be performed prior to washing the street; 

(e) Dye testing with verbal notification to the city a minimum of 24 hours prior to the time of the test;

(f) Nonstormwater discharges covered by another NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency or Washington State Department of Ecology; provided, that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations; and provided, that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system; 

(g) Discharges resulting from maintenance, repair, or operation of firefighting equipment and facilities that are not directly associated with public firefighting, including discharges from public firefighting training exercises, unless city-approved best management practices are implemented;

(h) Other nonstormwater discharges shall be in compliance with the requirements of a stormwater pollution prevention plan reviewed and approved by the city, which addresses control of such discharges by applying AKART to prevent contaminants from entering surface or groundwater.

(3) Allowable Discharges. The following types of discharges shall not be considered illicit discharges for the purposes of this chapter if they do not contain pollutants or unless the director determines that the type of discharge, whether singly or in combination with others, is causing or is likely to cause pollution of surface water or groundwater: 

(a) Diverted stream flows, rising groundwaters, uncontaminated groundwater infiltration (as defined in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations: 40 CFR 35.2005(20)), uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation water from agricultural sources that is commingled with urban stormwater, springs, water from crawl space pumps, footing drains, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, and discharges from emergency firefighting activities in accordance with “S2. Authorized Discharges” of the city’s NPDES permit. 

(b) Discharges specified in writing by the city as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 

(c) If a person can demonstrate that there are no additional pollutants being discharged from the premises above the background conditions of the water entering the site, that person shall not be in violation of subsection (1) of this section. 

(4) Prohibition of Illicit Connections. 

(a) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 

(b) Any connection identified by the director that could convey anything not composed entirely of surface and stormwater directly into municipal drainage facilities is considered an illicit connection and is prohibited with the following exceptions: connections conveying allowable discharges or connections conveying discharges pursuant to an NPDES permit or a state waste discharge permit. 

(c) Illicit connections must be disconnected and redirected, if warranted, to an approved on-site wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the city. 

(d) Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which is connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the city requiring that such locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be identified as a storm sewer, sanitary sewer, or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the city. 

(5) Prohibition of Stormwater Discharge to Sanitary Sewer. Stormwater shall not be discharged into the sanitary sewer without written permission to do so from the city of Port Orchard. 

(6) Prohibition of Waste Disposal. No person shall throw, deposit, leave, maintain, or keep in or upon any public or private property, the stormwater drainage system, or waters of the state any refuse, rubbish, garbage, litter, or other discarded or abandoned objects, articles, or accumulations that may cause or contribute to pollution. Wastes deposited in proper nonleaking waste receptacles for the purposes of collection are exempt from this prohibition. (Ord. 007-18 § 1; Ord. 019-09 § 8).


15.30.080 Suspension of MS4 access. 

(1) Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the public health or welfare, or to the MS4, or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons.

(2) Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. The city may terminate a person’s MS4 access if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may appeal such termination in accordance with POMC 15.30.150. No person shall reinstate MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city. (Ord. 019-09 § 9).


15.30.090 Industrial or construction activity discharges. 

Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. The city may require proof of compliance with said permit in a form acceptable to the city prior to allowing discharges to the MS4. (Ord. 019-09 § 10).


15.30.100 Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices (BMPs). 

(1) General. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system, watercourses, surface water, or groundwater through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs which have been approved by the city for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the state. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 

(2) BMP Descriptions. Approved BMPs are described in the stormwater management manual(s) adopted by the city. The manual(s) describes the types of regulated activities, the types of contaminants generated by each activity, the contaminant’s effect on water quality, the required source control BMPs, and the available treatment BMPs. The manual(s) includes information on design, maintenance, and allowable use of additional or alternative BMPs. 

(3) Priority of BMP Implementation. In applying the BMP manual, the director shall first require the implementation of source control BMPs unless the BMP manual specifically requires treatment BMPs. If source control BMPs (or treatment BMPs if required by the BMP manual) do not prevent contaminants from entering surface and stormwater or groundwater, the director may require implementation of additional source control BMPs and/or treatment BMPs according to AKART.

(4) Prevention of Pollution of Surface and Groundwater. BMPs shall be applied as required herein, so that when all appropriate combinations of individual BMPs are utilized, pollution of surface or groundwater is prevented. If all BMPs required herein, or by the director are applied, and pollution still occurs, the discharger shall modify existing practices or apply further water pollution control measures, as specified by the director. In the absence of implementation of applicable BMPs, the director shall be authorized to conclude that individual activities are causing pollution in violation of this section, and shall be authorized to enforce this chapter accordingly. (Ord. 019-09 § 11).


15.30.110 Watercourse protection. 

Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 019-09 § 12).


15.30.120 Notification of illicit discharges.

(1) Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person, including any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, who has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting, or may result in, illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the state, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. 

(a) In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services (911) and the public works department (360-876-4991). 

(b) In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the public works department in person or by phone (360-876-4991) or facsimile (360-876-4980) within 48 hours after said discharge. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone notice. 

(2) If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained in accordance with POMC 15.30.160. (Ord. 019-09 § 13).


15.30.130 Inspection and investigation. 

(1) Authorization. 

(a) Whenever implementing the provisions of this chapter or whenever there is cause to believe that a violation of this chapter has been or is being committed, the director is authorized to inspect during regular working hours and at other reasonable times all stormwater facilities within the city of Port Orchard to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 

(b) The director may observe BMPs or examine and/or sample surface and stormwater or groundwater as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. The director is further authorized, as set forth in subsections (2) and (4) of this section, to enter in or upon any public or private property for the purpose of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to the pollution of, or the possible pollution of, surface and/or groundwater. Whenever an on-site inspection of a property is made, the findings shall be documented. A copy of the inspection findings shall be furnished to the owner or the person in charge of the property after the conclusion of the investigation. 

(2) Right of Entry. The director is authorized to enter at all reasonable times in or upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of inspecting and investigating any conditions relating to the provisions of this chapter or any regulation adopted under this chapter; provided, that the city shall first obtain from the owner or person responsible for such premises, permission to enter. If entry is refused, the city shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. The right of entry is subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section. 

(a) If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the director. 

(b) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the facility operator. 

(c) No person who is the owner or operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity shall deny the city reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. 

(3) Obstructing the Director. No person shall obstruct the director in the performance of his or her official duties in the enforcement of this chapter, including but not limited to: 

(a) Intentional use of, or threat to use, force to obstruct a person he or she knows, or should reasonably know, is the director and is performing his or her official duties in the enforcement of stormwater system regulations; or 

(b) Acting in a manner that he or she knows, or should reasonably know, will interfere with or obstruct a person known to be, or who should reasonably be known to be, responsible for the enforcement of stormwater system regulations; or 

(c) Refusing to identify himself or herself and give his or her current address to the director for the enforcement of this chapter pursuant to an investigation of a violation upon request by the director. 

(4) Inspection Requirements. The director is authorized to develop inspection procedures and requirements for all stormwater facilities in the city of Port Orchard. In addition to any procedures for inspections developed by the director, the following shall apply:

(a) Prior to making any inspections on private property, the director shall present identification credentials, state the reason for the inspection, and request entry. 

(b) If the property, or any building or structure on the property, is unoccupied, the director shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person(s) having charge or control of the property or portions of the property and request entry. 

(c) Unless entry is consented to by the owner or person(s) in control of the property, or portion of the property, or unless conditions are reasonably believed to exist in the opinion of the director which create immediate danger to public health or safety, the director shall obtain a search warrant or other remedy, prior to entry, as authorized by the laws of the state of Washington. 

(d) Nothing in this section prevents the director from inspecting a stormwater system without consent of the property owner or a search warrant, provided the inspection can be conducted while remaining on public property or other property on which permission to enter is obtained. 

(5) Monitoring, Sampling, and Analysis. 

(a) Whenever the director determines that any person has violated or is violating the provisions of this chapter, the director may require the person responsible for the violation to sample and analyze any discharge, surface water, stormwater, groundwater, and/or sediment, in accordance with sampling and analytical procedures or requirements determined by the director. When the director has reason to believe that a connection is resulting in an illicit discharge, the director may sample and analyze the discharge and recover the costs from a person in an enforcement proceeding. When the discharge is likely to contain illicit discharges on a recurring basis, the director may conduct, or may require the person to conduct, ongoing monitoring (including sampling and testing) at the person’s expense. 

(b) The city shall have the right to set up on any facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility’s stormwater discharge. 

(c) The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. When monitoring is required, the discharger shall sample and analyze any discharge, surface and stormwater, groundwater, and/or sediment, in accordance with sampling and analytical procedures or requirements determined by the director. A copy of the analysis shall be provided to the director. (Ord. 019-09 § 14).


15.30.140 Enforcement and penalties. 

(1) Authorization. The director is authorized to enforce this chapter and any permit, order or approval issued pursuant to this chapter, against any violation or threatened violation thereof. 

(2) Compliance. The director shall attain compliance with this chapter by requiring the implementation of BMPs. The director may initially rely on education and informational assistance to gain compliance with this chapter, unless the director determines a violation poses a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare, endangers any property, or adversely affects the safety and operation of city right-of-way, utilities and/or other property owned or maintained by the city, that should be addressed through immediate penalties. The director may demand immediate cessation of discharges and assess penalties for violations that are an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or danger to the environment. Enforcement actions shall escalate for non-compliance. Enforcement shall include one or more of the following actions, singly or in combination. The director may apply whatever enforcement action, or combination of actions, is determined appropriate within the following range of actions, regardless of the position in the range. 

(a) Written warning with voluntary compliance. May be applied to first time, minor violations. Educational materials and informational assistance will be provided to the violator. 

(b) Compensatory actions such as community service related to stormwater education or mitigation in lieu of penalty or enforcement proceedings. Requires a formal written agreement between the director and the violator. 

(c) Written notice of violation ordering compliance. 

(d) Civil or criminal penalties. In accordance with subsections (4) and (5) of this section.

(e) Emergency cease and desist order. In circumstances where a violation poses a hazard to public health, safety, or welfare, endangers any property, or adversely affects the safety and operation of city right-of-way, utilities and/or other property owned or maintained by the city, the director is authorized to issue cease and desist orders. The cease and desist order may require immediate compliance with this chapter by halting operations and/or terminating discharges may be applied by means of the use of a stop work order. 

(f) Disconnection from the MS4. Applies to illicit connections to MS4, to illicit discharges in emergency situations, or continued failure of the property owner to comply. 

(g) Revocation of permit. Where the violation of this chapter provides a nuisance or poses a hazard to public health, safety and welfare, and has not previously been abated, the director may, upon written notice, revoke any and all permits associated with the site. Service of a written notice of revocation shall be in the same manner as service of a notice and order. Revocation of a permit by the director may be appealed within 10 working days of service of written notice. The appeal must be in accordance with POMC 15.30.150.

(3) Notice and Order. 

(a) Contents. The director shall have authority to issue to an owner or person responsible for a violation of this chapter an order to maintain or repair a component of a stormwater facility or BMP to bring it into compliance with this chapter or other city regulations, to remove any illicit connection, to cease any illicit discharge, and to repair or remediate any damages to the environment caused by any such violation. The order shall include the following: 

(i) The order identification number or permit number; and 

(ii) The street address, when available, and the tax parcel number of real property and/or description of personal property sufficient for identification of where the violation occurred or is located; and

If the director has determined that corrective work is required, the order shall require that all required permits be secured, that work physically be commenced, and that the work be completed within such times as the director determines are reasonable under the circumstances; and 

(vi) A statement advising that if any required work is not commenced or completed within the times specified, the director may proceed to cause abatement of the violation and cause the work to be done and charge the costs thereof as a lien against the property and as a joint and separate personal obligation of any person in violation; and 

(vii) Any requirements for monitoring, analyses and reporting; and 

(viii) A statement specifying the amount of any civil penalty assessed as a result of the violation and, if applicable, the conditions on which assessment of such civil penalty is contingent; and 

(ix) An order to the owner to provide the director a detailed plan showing drawings and steps that will be taken to achieve compliance within a specific time. The plan is subject to the approval of the director; and 

(x) A statement advising that the order shall become final unless, no later than 10 working days after the notice and order are served, any person aggrieved by the order requests an appeal in accordance with POMC 15.30.150. 

(b) Service. Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all persons identified in the notice and order either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice and order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. If the address of any such person cannot reasonably be ascertained, a copy of the notice and order shall be mailed to such person at the address of the location of the violation. The failure of any such person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. Service by certified mail in the manner provided in this section shall be effective on the date of postmark. The notice and order may be, but is not required to be, posted on the subject property. 

(c) Appeal. Persons to whom the notice and order of the director is issued may appeal the same within 10 working days of service. The appeal must be in accordance with POMC 15.30.150.

(4) Civil Infraction. Conduct made unlawful by this chapter shall constitute a class one civil infraction and is subject to enforcement and fines as provided in Chapter 2.64 POMC. Each day of noncompliance with any of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a separate offense.

(a) In addition to any other available sanction or remedial procedure, any person engaging in conduct made unlawful by this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty no greater than set by POMC 2.64.030 per day for each violation from the date set for compliance until the date of compliance. 

(b) Payment of a monetary penalty pursuant to this chapter does not relieve the person of the duty to correct the violation. 

(c) All civil penalties recovered during the enforcement of this chapter shall be deposited into a fund which shall be used by the city for the protection of surface and stormwater or groundwater as set forth in this chapter, through education or enhanced implementation. 

(5) Criminal Prosecution. Any person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to criminal prosecution and upon conviction, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor for the first offense and a gross misdemeanor for any subsequent offense occurring within a five-year period. Each day of noncompliance with any of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a separate offense.

(6) Recovery of Costs Incurred by the City. In addition to any costs for enforcement under this chapter, any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge, including but not limited to the costs for bringing the city back into compliance with its NPDES permit associated with any violation of these regulations, and any fines levied for violations of the city’s NPDES permit. 

(7) Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. Any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator’s expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 

(8) Summary Abatement. 

(a) Whenever any violation of this chapter causes or creates a condition, the continued existence of which constitutes, in the opinion of the director, an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the director may summarily and without prior notice, at the cost of the owner, abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. 

(b) Within 15 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including labor and materials, legal expenses, administrative costs, and interest to the extent such costs are known. Persons to whom the assessment of costs of abatement is issued may appeal the same within 10 working days of service. The appeal must be in accordance with POMC 15.30.150. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 

(9) The owner shall pay the abatement costs in not more than 12 equal payments. Such costs shall accrue interest at the rate set by the city’s finance department per annum or the rate charged to the city for obtaining the funds necessary to abate, whichever interest is greater. 

(10) Injunctive Relief. In addition to any other remedy provided by this chapter or the Port Orchard Municipal Code, the city may initiate injunction or abatement proceedings or any other appropriate action in courts against any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter and/or to restore a condition which existed prior to the violation. In any such proceeding, the person violating and/or failing to comply with any provisions of this chapter shall be liable for the costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the city in bringing, maintaining, and/or prosecuting such action. 

(11) Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state, or local law and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative remedies. (Ord. 019-09 § 15).


15.30.150 Appeals. 

(1) The director’s notice and order, revocation of a permit, or assessment of costs of abatement may be appealed to the city council by persons to whom the notice and order, revocation of a permit, or assessment of costs of abatement is issued. An appeal shall be considered timely if, but only if, it is filed in writing with the director within 10 working days of service, and the appeal fee adopted by the city council is paid in full. In addition to the appeal fee, if the director determines that the services of an independent consultant are reasonably necessary in adjudicating the appeal, the appellant shall make an initial cash deposit to pay for an independent review as the same may be reasonably required by the director. The initial deposit, which is only an estimate of the consultant’s costs, shall be paid in advance of the hearing. If it is determined during any point in the appeal process that the initial deposit is insufficient to cover all reasonable consultant’s costs, the appellant shall be required to make an additional deposit in an amount sufficient to cover the same. Any portion of the deposit that is not used to cover all reasonable consultant’s costs shall be refunded to the appellant. The amount of the deposit shall be at least $500.00 but not more than $1,500, and it shall be determined by the director based upon a good faith estimate of permissible costs. The appellant shall be given equal access to any report prepared by the consultant. 

(2) The director shall accept appeals that meet the requirements of this section and shall schedule such appeals for consideration by the city council. The city council hearing shall be scheduled within 60 days after the appeal is accepted. The director shall reject any appeal that fails to meet the filing and submittal requirements of this section. The appeal fee shall be refunded in the event the director rejects the appeal or in the event that the appellant files a statement with the director withdrawing the appeal at least 15 calendar days before the scheduled hearing. In all other cases, the appeal fee shall be nonrefundable. 

(3) The written appeal shall contain all of the following information and attachments: 

(a) A copy of the notice and order, revocation of a permit, or assessment of costs of abatement being appealed; 

(b) The name of the property owner and, if applicable, the owner’s agent; 

(c) The name and signature of each appellant and a statement showing that each is entitled to file the appeal under subsection (1) of this section; and 

(d) A statement of appeal identifying each issue in the notice and order or assessment of costs of abatement that the appellant wishes to appeal, the reasons why each issue is in error as a matter of fact and/or law, and evidence relied upon. 

(4) The city council, under its quasi-judicial authority, shall hear the appeal in an open record hearing. At least 10 business days before the hearing, notice of the same shall be mailed to parties who are entitled to notice of the decision. The notice of hearing does not need to be posted or published. The appeal shall be limited to those issues raised in subsection (3)(d) of this section, and shall be similar in format as other quasi-judicial matters that may from time to time come before the city council. 

(5) At least 10 business days before the hearing, the director and appellant shall each submit, as part of the record, separate reports to the city council containing a statement of the issues and applicable laws, discussion and analysis, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and copies of any pertinent document referenced therein. The burden shall be on the city to support the order of the director by a preponderance of the evidence. Reports, if any, prepared by the independent consultant referenced in subsection (1) of this section shall be part of the record. The city council shall decide as follows, based upon the record made during the course of the public hearing: 

(a) Uphold the order, revocation, or assessment of costs of abatement of the director in its entirety; or 

(b) Uphold the order, revocation, or assessment of costs of abatement of the director in part and reverse the order, revocation, or assessment of costs of abatement in part; or 

(c) Reverse the order, revocation, or assessment of costs of abatement of the director in its entirety. 

(6) The city council shall issue a final decision on the appeal supported by written findings and conclusions within 10 business days of the hearing. The decision shall also include venue information and limitations on filing judicial appeal(s) of the decision. The director shall serve a copy of the final decision to the appellant and other parties of record. Service shall be in the same manner as set forth in POMC 15.30.140(3)(b). (Ord. 019-09 § 16).


15.30.160 Records retention. 

If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its occurrence. Such records shall be kept and maintained on a permanent basis from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. The record shall includes books, documents, memoranda, reports, and correspondence relating to any operation, maintenance, monitoring, sampling, and chemical analysis associated with the discharge and all records which pertain to matters which are the subject of any enforcement or litigation activities brought by the director pursuant to this chapter. Copies of any or all records shall be provided to the director upon his request. (Ord. 019-09 § 17).


15.30.170 Construction – Intent. 

This chapter is enacted as an exercise of the city’s power to protect and preserve public health, safety, and welfare. Its provisions shall be liberally construed to give full effect to the objectives and purposes for which it was enacted. This chapter is not enacted to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will, or should be, especially protected or benefited by the terms of this chapter. The primary obligation of compliance with this chapter is placed upon the person holding title to the property. Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be, or shall be, construed to create or form a basis for liability for the city, its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of the person holding title to the property (owner of record) to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or by reason or in consequence of any act or omission, to act in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this chapter by the city, its officers, employees, or agents.

20.02.005 Title citation.

This title shall be known and may be cited as the Port Orchard “land use and development regulatory code” or “land use and development regulations.” (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.02.010 Purpose.

This title establishes comprehensive land use and development regulations for the city. It is the declared purpose of the city council that these regulations implement the city’s policies adopted in the city’s comprehensive plan in compliance with the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA) and the Shoreline Management Act (SMA), and implement the requirements of the state’s Regulatory Reform Act, which has a primary goal of integrating environmental review with project review. This land use and development regulatory code is to be used as a guide by governmental agencies when taking action within the city’s urban growth area (UGA). (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.02.015 Authority.

(1) This title is adopted under the authority of Article XI, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution. 

(2) The following authority is granted in administering this title: 

(a) The community development director (“director”), as the duly authorized representative of the mayor, is charged with the responsibility of carrying out an official interpretation of the provisions of the land use and development regulatory code.

(a) Incomplete, invalid, inaccurate, or defective applications eligible for vesting pursuant to this chapter;

(b) Uses not specifically disclosed in an application eligible for vesting pursuant to this chapter; 

(c) Any other application or permit not specifically identified in this chapter, as it exists or may be amended;

(e) Preapplication plans; or

(f) Any application or permit that may reasonably result in a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare of the community. The city’s exercise of police power to protect the public health and safety, and/or general welfare immediately extinguishes any “vested right.” (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.08.020 Approved applications.

(1) Allowed Use. A building, land use, or development application must be allowed under the zoning or other land use control ordinances in effect on the date of the application to be deemed a valid counter-complete building application eligible for vesting pursuant to this chapter.

(2) Supplemental Information. Supplemental information required after an application is deemed counter-complete shall not affect the validity of the vesting for the application.

(3) Substantial Revisions. Substantial revisions requested or required by an applicant to a vested, but not yet approved, application pursuant to POMC 20.24.070 shall be deemed a new application when such revisions would result in a substantial change in the basic site design plan, intensity, density, or similar factors, involving a change of 10 percent or more. Vesting for the new application shall occur upon the date of submission of a valid and counter-complete building application for the changed project.

(4) Vesting of Land Use and Development Approval Applications. The following applies to all applications described in POMC 20.08.010, excluding building permits:

An application shall be reviewed for consistency with the construction, public works, and stormwater standards in effect on the date a separate application for a construction, utility, or stormwater drainage permit is deemed counter-complete. An applicant may submit a separate construction, utility, or stormwater drainage permit application simultaneously with any application described in POMC 20.08.010 to vest for construction or public works standards.

(c) Effective Regulations. An application shall be subject to all land use, building, and land use control ordinances in effect on the vesting date.1 

(d) Identified Development. An application that is deemed complete is vested for the specific use, density, and physical development identified in the application.

(e) Applicable Standards. Applications submitted that are not listed in POMC 20.08.010 shall be governed by the standards applicable to the specific application type. These applications shall not vest for any additional zoning or land use control ordinances.

(f) Owner Solely Responsible. The property owner is responsible for monitoring the time limitations and review deadlines for the application. The city shall not be responsible for maintaining a valid application. If the application expires, a new application may be filed, but shall be subject to the zoning or land use control ordinances in effect on the date the new application is deemed counter-complete. 

(g) The applications do not vest to processes and procedures. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

20.24.010 Preapplication conference.

(1) The purpose of a preapplication conference is to discuss the nature of the proposed development; application and approval requirements, fees, review process, and schedule; and applicable policies and regulations. As appropriate, the director shall invite representatives of affected agencies, such as other city departments and special purpose districts, to attend any preapplication meeting. The preapplication conference may be recorded.

(2) Requests for scheduling a preapplication conference shall be submitted on forms provided by the city along with payment of the associated fee pursuant to the city’s current fee schedule.

(3) Unless waived by the director, potential applicants or their designees are required to attend a preapplication conference with city staff for all Type II, Type III, and Type IV land use actions. This meeting requirement should be deemed waived in the event the director or director’s designee is unavailable to meet within 30 calendar days of a request for such meeting. When a preapplication conference is required, the applicant shall meet with the director and any other staff members, as appropriate, to discuss the proposed development.

(4) Applicants may also request an optional preapplication conference if not otherwise required.

(a) Identification of the subject property;

(b) Description of the type of planned development, including proposed uses, estimated density; and

(c) Identification of any requests for deviation from code requirements.

(6) Failure of the director or any city staff member to provide any of the information required by this section shall not constitute a waiver of any of the standards, criteria, or requirements for the application. Any discussion at the preapplication conference is for the purpose of acquainting the applicant with the known requirements for an undefined proposal. As a result, the discussions shall not bind the city in any manner or prevent the city’s future enforcement of all applicable codes, plans, and regulations. (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.24.020 Master permit required.

(1) A master permit application is required for all land use and development projects and shall be submitted in conjunction with the associated permit application(s) required for the project. The master permit application may not be submitted alone.

(2) The director shall establish and may revise at his/her discretion submittal requirements for the master permit application. At a minimum, the master permit application shall require the following:

(a) Name and contact information of applicant;

(b) Signature by the property owner or person having authorization to sign on behalf of the property owner;

(c) List of all project permit applications submitted with the master permit;

(d) List of any permits or decisions applicable to the project proposal that have been obtained prior to filing the application or that are pending before the city or any other governmental entity;

(e) Indication of whether review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) applies to the project, or if the project is categorically exempt, pursuant to Chapter 20.160 POMC; and

(f) Indication of whether stormwater drainage review applies to the project pursuant to Chapter 20.150 POMC.

(3) For purposes of this subtitle, all references to an “application” refers to both the master permit and associated permit application(s). (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.24.030 Submission requirements.

(1) The director shall establish and may revise at his/her discretion submittal requirements for each type of land use and development permit application required under this title. The submittal requirements shall be in the form of a counter-complete checklist. The requirements shall be made available to the public in a form that clearly explains what material must be submitted for an application to be considered complete, including type, size, detail, and number of copies for each item.

(2) At a minimum, the following shall be completed and submitted by the applicant for all land use and development applications:

(a) Master permit application form, pursuant to POMC 20.24.020;

(b) Appropriate application form, provided by the department, for each permit submitted with the master permit, including all required items stated therein;

(c) Payment of any and all applicable permit fees pursuant to this title and the city’s current fee schedule at the time of application;

(d) Environmental checklist (if not exempt from SEPA review pursuant to Chapter 20.160 POMC) and any requirements for SEPA review, when applicable; and

(e) Applicable signatures, stamps, or certifications, and attestation by written oath of applicant to the accuracy of all information submitted for an application.

(f) Requirements for related permits shall also be provided when applicable.

(3) The director may require additional material when the director determines, after a determination of technical completeness pursuant to POMC 20.24.050, that such information is needed to adequately assess the proposed project.

(4) When not required by law, submittal requirements may be waived by the director, in writing, only if the applicant can demonstrate that normally required information is not relevant to the proposed action and is not required to show that an application complies with applicable city codes and regulations.

(5) The city’s acceptance of documents from an applicant using a counter-complete checklist is used only for purposes of documenting what was submitted by the applicant; it is not a technical review for completeness or compliance with state or local laws and regulations. See POMC 20.24.040 for the counter-complete review process. (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.24.040 Counter-completeness.

(1) Applications may either be brought in person to the city or applications may be mailed to the city for counter-complete review.

(2) An application is counter-complete if the director finds that the application purports and appears to include the information required by the master permit application and associated permit application(s); provided, no effort shall be made to evaluate the substantive adequacy of the information in the application(s) in the counter-complete review process. No effort shall be made to determine ownership of land as part of the counter-complete review process.

(3) The director shall make a counter-complete determination regarding an application brought in person to the city while the applicant is present. For applications mailed to the city, the counter-complete determination shall be made within two business days from the date of receipt. If the city does not provide a counter-complete determination for a mailed application, the application shall be deemed counter-complete as of the third day from receipt.

(4) If the director decides the application is counter-complete, then the application may be submitted and the appropriate fee shall be paid by the applicant.

(5) If the director decides the application is not counter-complete, then the city shall reject and return the application and identify in writing what is needed to make the application counter-complete. (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.24.050 Application review.

Within five business days of determining an application as counter-complete, the director shall transmit a copy of the application, or appropriate parts of the application, to each affected government agency and city department for review and comment to determine technical completeness of the application. The affected agencies and city departments shall have 15 calendar days from the date of the transmittal to comment on whether the application is technically complete and to provide a list of missing information if it is not complete. The agency or city department is presumed to have no comment if comments are not received within this 15-calendar-day period from application transmittal. The director shall grant an extension of time only if the application involves unusual circumstances, provided comments are received at least three business days prior to the 28-day deadline for determining technical completeness. (Ord. 056-19 § 3).


20.24.060 Technical completeness.

(1) Within 28 calendar days of determining an application as counter-complete, the director shall determine whether an application is technically complete. A project permit application is technically complete for purposes of this section when it meets the submission requirements of this chapter as well as the submission requirements contained in other applicable sections of the code. This determination of technical completeness shall be made when the application is sufficient for continued processing even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be subsequently undertaken.

(2) A determination of technical completeness shall not preclude the city from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the notice of completeness or at some later time. Such new information may be required to establish whether the proposal meets applicable city codes and regulations, whether additional environmental study is required, or, more generally, when there are substantial changes in the proposed action.

(3) The city may determine that a counter-complete application is not technically complete because the information submitted is not sufficient for further processing, is incomplete, or is factually incorrect. If the applicant receives a written determination from the city that an application is not technically complete, the applicant shall have up to 90 calendar days to submit the necessary information to the city. Within 14 calendar days after an applicant has submitted the requested additional information, the city shall determine whether the application is technically complete.

(4) If an applicant either refuses in writing to submit additional information or does not submit the required information within 90 calendar days, the application shall be terminated.

(5) If the director does not provide written notification that an application is technically incomplete within the 28-day period, the application shall be deemed technically complete for processing as of the twenty-ninth calendar day following the determination of counter-completeness. (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1). Formerly 20.24.050).


20.24.070 Project review – Public notice.

(1) Within 10 business days of determining an application as technically complete, and before making a decision on the application, the director shall issue a notice of application as set forth in POMC 20.25.010. The director shall grant an extension of time only if the application involves unusual circumstances.

(2) Except when a land use action is categorically exempt from SEPA, environmental review shall be conducted concurrently with review of other proposed land use actions requested by an applicant. When a proposed development requires more than one land use action, the applicant may request concurrent review of all proposed land use actions. (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 002-19 § 2; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1). Formerly 20.24.080).


20.24.080 Required corrections.

(1) Following a determination of technical completeness and the commencement of project review, the director may make a determination in writing that some information is incorrect or that additional information is required. The applicant shall have up to 90 calendar days to submit corrected/additional information.

(2) Within 14 calendar days of receiving corrected/additional information, the director shall determine whether the information, plans, or other review materials are now correct and sufficient for further review. If the city determines that the information submitted by the applicant is insufficient, or if additional information is required, the city shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies and the procedures of this section shall apply as if the city made a new request for information.

(3) If an applicant either refuses in writing to submit additional information or does not submit the required information within 90 calendar days, the application shall be canceled. (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1). Formerly 20.24.060).


20.24.090 Revisions.

(1) If, in the judgment of the director, the content of an application is so substantially revised by an applicant, either voluntarily or as corrections, that such revised proposal constitutes a substantially different proposal than that originally submitted, the director shall deem the revised proposal to be a new application.

(2) In reaching a decision whether a revision is substantial, the director shall consider the relative and absolute magnitude of the revision, the environmental sensitivity of the site, any changes in location of significant elements of the project and their relation to public facilities, surrounding lands and land uses, and the stage of review of the proposal. Lesser revisions that would not constitute substantial revisions during early stages of review may be substantial during later stages due to the reduced time and opportunity remaining for interested parties to review and comment upon such changes.

(3) Written notice of such determination of substantial revision shall be provided to the applicant and all parties of record.

(4) A determination that any revision is substantial shall result in the time periods mandated by the Regulatory Reform Act, Chapter 36.70B RCW, and set forth in this title to reset and start from the date at which the revised project application is determined to be technically complete.

(5) A revised project application shall be subject to all laws, regulations, and standards in effect on the date of receipt of such technically complete substantial revision. (Ord. 056-19 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1). Formerly 20.24.070).


20.24.100 Decision criteria. 

The criteria set forth below shall apply to all Type I through IV land use and development permit applications:

(1) Determination of Consistency. The applications are reviewed by the city to determine consistency between the proposed project and the applicable land use and development regulations and the comprehensive plan.

(3) For project permit applications, the city shall issue a notice of decision within 120 days of the issuance of the determination of technical completeness on the application, unless the applicant has agreed to a different deadline.

(4) In calculating the time periods for issuance of the notice of decision, the following periods shall be excluded:

(a) Any period during which the applicant has been requested by the director to correct plans, perform required studies, or provide additional required information. The period shall begin from the date the director notifies the applicant of the need for additional information, until the date the director determines that the additional information satisfies the request for information, or 14 calendar days after the date the additional information is provided to the city, whichever is earlier;

(b) If the director determines that the information submitted is insufficient, the applicant shall be informed of the particular insufficiencies and the procedures set forth in POMC 20.24.060 for calculating the exclusion period shall apply;

Chapter 20.26 PERMITTING AND DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL – DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS

Sections:

20.26.010    Intent and discretionary nature.

20.26.020    Form of agreement, effect and general provisions.

20.26.030    Application requirements.

20.26.040    Phasing.

20.26.050    Processing procedures and appeals.


20.26.010 Intent and discretionary nature.

The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the use of development agreements, consistent with RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210. The city may, but under no circumstances is required to, enter into a development agreement with a person having ownership or control of real property within the city. The development agreement may address such project elements as those set forth in RCW 36.70B.170B(3). The development agreement shall be consistent with the applicable development regulations of the city. The consideration provided by the property owner for the city’s decision to enter into the development agreement may vary, depending on the benefit the development agreement will provide to the city and/or the public in general. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.26.020 Form of agreement, effect and general provisions.

(1) Form. All development agreements shall be on the standard form approved in advance by the city attorney for this purpose.

(2) Decision Type. Development agreements are a Type V action and shall be reviewed and approved pursuant to the procedures in Chapter 20.22 POMC and this chapter.

(3) Effect. Development agreements are not project permit applications and are not subject to the permit processing procedures in Chapter 36.70B RCW or Chapter 20.24 POMC. A development agreement shall constitute a binding contract between the city and the property owner and the subsequent owners of any later-acquired interests in the property identified in the development agreement. A development agreement governs the project identified in the development agreement during the term of the development agreement, or for all or that part of the build-out period specified in the development agreement, and may not be subject to an amendment to a zoning ordinance or development standard adopted after the effective date of the agreement. A permit or approval issued/granted by the city after execution of a valid development agreement must be consistent with the development agreement.

(3) Limitations. 

(a) A development agreement shall be limited to a 20-year term if any provision of the agreement requires the city to: 

(i) Refrain from exercising any authority that it would have otherwise been able to exercise in the absence of the development agreement; 

(ii) Defer application to the subject property of any newly adopted development regulations that would otherwise apply to the property identified in the agreement; or

(iii) Allow vesting beyond the applicable deadlines for a phased development. 

(b) The development agreement shall also contain a proviso that the city may, without incurring any liability, engage in action that would otherwise be a breach if the city makes a determination on the record that the action is necessary to avoid a serious threat to public health and safety, or if the action is required by federal or state law.

(4) Developer’s Compliance. The development agreement shall include a clause stating that the city’s duties under the agreement are expressly conditioned upon the property owner’s substantial compliance with each and every term, condition, provision and/or covenant in the development agreement, all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations and the property owner’s obligations as identified in any approval or project permit for the property identified in the development agreement.

(5) No Third Party Rights. Except as otherwise provided in the development agreement, the development agreement shall create no rights enforceable by any party who/which is not a party to the development agreement.

(6) Liability. The development agreement shall include a clause providing that any breach of the development agreement by the city shall give right only to damages under state contract law and shall not give rise to any liability under Chapter 64.40 RCW, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, or similar state constitutional provisions.

(7) Termination and Modification. Every development agreement shall have an identified, specific termination date. Upon termination, any further development of the property shall conform to the development regulations applicable to the property at the time of permit application. The city shall not modify any development agreement by extending the termination date. Any request for a modification shall be consistent with the city’s development regulations applicable to the property at the time of the request, not the original execution date of the development agreement. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.26.030 Application requirements.

A complete application for a development agreement shall consist of the following:

(1) Name, address, telephone number and email address (if any) of the property owner. If the applicant is not the property owner, the applicant must submit a verified statement from the property owner that the applicant has the property owner’s permission to submit the application;

(2) Address, parcel number and legal description of the property proposed to be subject to the development agreement;

(3) Recent title report confirming that the property identified in the application is owned by the applicant/property owner;

(4) Identification of any application (project permit application, comprehensive plan amendment application, development regulation amendment application) that is related to the proposed development agreement;

(5) SEPA checklist;

(6) A completed application form and the application fee established by the city for this purpose; and

(7) Any other information requested by the community development director relevant to the processing of the development agreement. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.26.040 Phasing.

(1) In order to phase a project to extend the vested rights associated with an underlying project permit application, a development agreement is required. This ensures the availability of public facilities and services to all of the property in the identified individual phases, allows tracking of the available capacity of public facilities and utilities during each phase of construction, and with the extension of the vested rights associated with the project, provides certainty to the developer in the subsequent development approval process.

(2) The deadlines in the city’s code relating to each type of project permit application must be consulted to establish the baseline vesting period. The city is not required to extend the vesting period. If the city decides to do so through a development agreement, it must be in exchange for the property owner’s provision of corresponding benefits to the city in the form of, for example, contributions to public facilities and amenities over and above what would normally be required. In any event, the city shall not allow vesting to extend beyond the established 20-year period after approval of the project permit application.

(3) A development agreement for a phased development (such as a subdivision) shall include (in addition to all of the information in POMC 20.26.030), all of the following:

(a) Identification of the phasing schedule;

(b) Identification of the number of phases and all lots included in each phase;

(c) Identification of the approximate dates for construction of public streets, public utilities and other improvements in each phase;

(d) Identification of the approximate dates for commencement of development of each lot, lot sales and building occupancy;

(e) Identification of the benefits that the property owner will provide to the city in exchange for permission to phase the development according to the proposed schedule;

(f) Establishment of the deadline for the property owner to submit development applications, including building permit applications, for each phase;

(g) A description of the manner in which each phase is designed such that all site requirements are satisfied independently of phases yet to be given final approval and constructed;

(h) A description of the manner in which the property owner will ensure that adequate public facilities are available when the impact of development occurs. The property owner shall acknowledge in the development agreement that if the demand for public facilities or services needed to accommodate a subsequent development phase increases following the issuance of a development permit for a prior phase in the approval process, or if public facilities or services included in a concurrency or SEPA determination are not constructed as scheduled in the city’s capital facilities plan, final development approval may have to be delayed for future phases pending the achievement of the adopted levels of service. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.26.050 Processing procedures and appeals.

(1) A development agreement must be submitted for review in conjunction with at least one land use and development permit for the underlying project. The development agreement application may be consolidated for processing with the underlying project permit application or other application for approval. If the development agreement is consolidated with a project permit application, the property owner must agree to waive the deadline in RCW 36.70B.080 and POMC 20.24.100 for issuance of a final decision on the underlying application, as well as the prohibition of no more than one open record hearing and one closed record hearing on the underlying project permit application in RCW 36.70B.060(3).

(2) Public Notice and Public Hearing.

(a) Notice of the public hearing shall be provided pursuant to POMC 20.22.070.

(b) If the owner of the real property which is the subject of the development agreement owns another parcel or parcels of real property which lie adjacent to the real property included in the development agreement, notice under this subsection shall be given to owners of real property located within 300 feet of any portion of the boundaries of such adjacently located parcels of real property owned by the owner of the real property included in the development agreement.

(c) The hearing on the development agreement shall be held pursuant to POMC 20.22.070. While the director or hearing examiner may provide a recommendation on a development agreement (even if the director or hearing examiner makes the final decision on the underlying project permit application), the city council shall make the final decision whether to approve a development agreement by ordinance after the public hearing.

(d) Modifications to a development agreement shall be in writing, signed by the duly authorized representatives of the parties, be consistent with this chapter and, where considered substantive as determined by the director, follow the same procedures set forth in this chapter.

(3) Appeal. A development agreement associated with an underlying project permit application may be appealed in the same manner and within the same deadline as the underlying project permit application. A development agreement associated with a legislative approval, such as a comprehensive plan amendment, may be appealed in the same manner and within the same deadline as the legislative approval.

(4) Recording Against the Property. The city shall record the development agreement against the property with the real property records of the Kitsap County auditor. During the term of the agreement, it is binding upon the owners of the property and any successors in interest to such property. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

20.28.200    Deadline for final decision.

20.28.210    Effect of approval.

20.28.220    Expiration.


20.28.100 Purpose.

The purpose of a variance is to provide a means whereby the literal terms of the city’s zoning code need not be applied, if circumstances or conditions not created by, or not within the property owner’s control, have created practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that undermine the spirit of these regulations or undermine public safety and welfare. A variance cannot authorize a change to an allowed use or required density limitations. In sum, the variance procedures provide relief from specific dimensional standards in the code (e.g., setbacks) when they have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other codes. Variances are not favored and are intended to allow relief in circumstances in which the zoning code requirements significantly diminish the value of a specific property. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.110 Applicability. 

(1) Deviation from Land Use Regulations Only. The variance procedures provided for in this chapter are for the consideration of deviations from only the city’s land use regulations provided for under this title;

(2) Shoreline Variances. For properties located within the city’s shoreline zone, a deviation from the standards and regulations of the city’s shoreline master program requires a separate shoreline variance pursuant to the procedures under Chapter 20.164 POMC;

(3) Exceptions and Modifications Versus Variances. A code standard or approval criterion (“code section”) may be modified without approval of a variance if the applicable code expressly allows exceptions or modifications. If the code section does not expressly provide for exceptions or modifications, then a variance is required to modify that code section and the provisions of this chapter apply;

(4) Types of Variances. There are three types of variances: administrative (1 and 2) and quasi-judicial. The type of variance required depends on the extent of the variance request and the discretion involved in the decision-making process;

(5) Prohibitions. The city will not grant any variance that will allow the establishment of a use which: 

(a) Is not otherwise permitted in the zone;

(b) Would result in the extension of a nonconforming use or structure; or 

(c) Would change the development regulations in the zone applicable to the subject property;

(6) A variance will not result in violation(s) of any other adopted ordinance or code standard; each code standard to be modified shall require a separate variance request; 

(7) An application for an administrative Type 1 variance may only apply to a single lot/parcel or a single identified development project; and

(8) No more than three administrative Type 1 variances may be approved for one lot or parcel. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.120 Administration of administrative variance.

The director is authorized and directed to administer the provisions of this chapter relating to administrative variances. There is no public hearing, and after issuance of the final decision, the hearing examiner has the authority to hear and issue a decision on an appeal in an open record hearing. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.130 Procedure for administrative variance.

Administrative variance applications are processed pursuant to Chapter 20.24 POMC. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.140 Requirements for a complete application.

A complete application for either an administrative or quasi-judicial variance application shall include the items listed below. Refer to the relevant city application form for numbers of copies of each item that must be included and the type of accompanying electronic submittal that is required (if relevant).

(1) Application form. Seven copies of a completed application form (including all supporting documents);

(2) Date, name, address, telephone number and email of the applicant;

(3) Name, address, telephone number and email of the owner of the property identified in the application; 

(4) Legal description of the subject property;

(5) Description and photographs of existing site conditions, any plans and/or relevant information to the proposed variance;

(6) A site plan and building elevation drawings of all structures proposed to be developed on the subject property. More specific architectural drawings may be required depending on the content of the variance request; 

(7) Identification of all sections of the city’s zoning code from which the applicant seeks the variance and a complete description of the requested variance from such section(s);

(8) Description of any proposed development of the property, applying the proposed variance from the identified code section(s);

(9) An explanation of the rationale for the proposed variance;

(10) The applicant’s narrative statement describing the manner in which the application satisfies the criteria for variance approval in POMC 20.28.150 or 20.28.180 depending on the type of variance;

(11) A SEPA checklist (unless categorically exempt);

(12) Concurrency determination (water, sewer and traffic if applicable);

(13) The application fee established by the city;

(14) Any other required information as indicated by city staff in a preapplication meeting. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.150 Administrative variances – Definition and criteria for approval. 

(1) Administrative Variance Type 1. 

(a) A Type 1 administrative variance is defined as: 

(i) Front Yard Setbacks. Up to a 10 percent reduction to the front yard setback standard in the applicable land use zoning district.

(ii) Interior Setbacks. Up to a 10 percent reduction of the dimensional standards for the side and rear yard setbacks required in the applicable land use zoning district. 

(iii) Lot Coverage. Up to a 10 percent increase of the maximum lot coverage required in the applicable land use zoning district.

(iv) Landscape Area. Up to a 10 percent reduction in landscape area (overall area or interior parking lot landscape area). 

(v) Building Height. Up to a 10 percent increase in maximum building height in the applicable land use zoning district, except within any land use zoning district or overlay district with view protection regulations. 

(b) A Type 1 administrative variance may be approved if the applicant demonstrates all of the following: 

(i) There is no presumption of validity favoring the action of granting a variance;

(ii) The variance requested is required due to the lot configuration, or other conditions of the site;

(iii) The variance does not require the removal of any trees within a critical area or its buffer, designated greenbelt, or habit conservation area; or it is proposed in order to avoid or reduce impact to floodplains, significant trees, wetlands, or other natural features. Modification of the standard shall not be more than is necessary for the preservation of the natural feature to be preserved or protected;

(iv) The subject property cannot be reasonably used under the city’s land use regulations as written.

(2) Administrative Variance Type 2.

(a) The following Type 2 administrative variances may be approved on individual platted and recorded lots only. The administrative variance procedure shall not be used to modify a standard for lots yet to be created through a platting process under Chapter 20.86 or 20.88 POMC.

(i) Variance to Parking Standards. A variance may be approved to the minimum or maximum standards for off-street parking (quantities and dimensions of parking spaces) if the applicant demonstrates all of the following: 

(A) There is no presumption of validity favoring the action of granting a variance;

(B) The individual characteristics of the use at that location require more or less parking than is generally required for a use of this type and intensity, or modified parking dimensions, as demonstrated by a parking analysis or other facts provided by the applicant;

(C) The need for additional parking cannot reasonably be met through provision of on-street parking or shared parking with adjacent or nearby uses; and 

(D) All other code standards are met in conformance with the underlying zoning district and design standards. 

(ii) Variance to Bicycle Parking Standards. There is no presumption of validity favoring the action of granting a variance. A variance may be approved to reduce the number of required bicycle parking standards required in Chapter 20.124 POMC if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed use by its nature would be reasonably anticipated to generate a lesser need for bicycle parking. 

(iii) Variance to Vehicle Stacking Area. There is no presumption of validity favoring the action of granting a variance. A variance may be approved to reduce the amount of vehicle stacking area required for drive-through facilities if such a reduction is deemed appropriate after analysis of the size and location of the development, limited services available and other pertinent factors.

(iv) Variance to Loading Area Standards. There is no presumption of validity favoring the action of granting a variance. A variance may be approved to modify the loading area standards if such a reduction is deemed appropriate after analysis of the use, anticipated shipping or delivery traffic generated by the use and alternatives for loading/unloading, such as use of on- or off-street parking areas during nonbusiness hours; provided, that traffic, pedestrian access, and circulation standards are not impeded. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.160 Administration of quasi-judicial variances.

The planning director is authorized and directed to administer the provisions of this chapter relating to quasi-judicial variances. The authority to hold an open record hearing and provide a final decision on variances is granted to the hearing examiner and the city council has the authority to make a decision on appeal after a closed record hearing. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.170 Procedure for quasi-judicial variance approval.

Quasi-judicial variance applications are processed pursuant to Chapters 20.20, 20.22, 20.24 and 20.25 POMC. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.180 Quasi-judicial variances – Definition and criteria for approval. 

(1) Quasi-Judicial Variances – Definition. Any request for a variance under the city’s zoning code that does not meet the definition of an administrative variance above shall be processed as a quasi-judicial variance. 

(2) Approval Criteria. There is no presumption of validity favoring the action of granting a variance. The hearing examiner may not approve a quasi-judicial variance unless the applicant demonstrates that all of the following criteria are satisfied: 

(a) That, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including its size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of these regulations will deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the same vicinity and zone as the subject property; 

(b) That a grant of a variance will be subject to conditions to ensure that the adjustment authorized is the minimum variation needed and that it will not constitute a grant of special privilege(s) inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which such property is located;

(c) The special circumstances applicable to the property are not self-imposed by any person having an interest in the property; and

(d) The variance will not allow the establishment of a use which: (i) is materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; (ii) is not otherwise permitted in the zone; (iii) would result in the extension of a nonconforming use or structure; or (iv) would change the terms of the zone applicable to any or all of the subject property. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.190 Conditioning.

Issuance of a variance may be made subject to such conditions as are necessary to carry out the purpose of this code and ensure that the variance authorized shall not constitute a granting of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which such property is located. Conditions serving to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property in the neighborhood shall include, but shall not be limited to: limitations on size and location, hours of operation, requirements for landscaping or buffer yards, lighting and ingress and egress. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.200 Deadline for final decision.

A variance application (either administrative or quasi-judicial) shall be approved, approved with conditions or denied within 120 days after the application has been determined complete, unless the applicant consents in writing to a longer processing time period. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.210 Effect of approval.

Issuance of a variance shall be deemed to allow variation from the code section identified in the approval only to the extent authorized in the decision. Development of the property subject to the variance shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits and approvals required by the city, or any applicable regional, state and federal agencies. Approval of a variance shall not be a precedent for the approval of other variances in the zoning district. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.28.220 Expiration.

A variance approval shall become null and void three years after the effective date, unless one of the following has occurred: 

(1) A building permit has been issued and construction begun and diligently pursued;

(2) An extension has been granted by the planning director. Such extension shall be for a maximum of one year, and no extension may be granted which would extend the validity of the variance more than five years beyond the effective date of the variance. No extension will be granted if it necessitates modification of any condition of approval. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

20.38.600 Downtown height overlay district (DHOD).

A downtown height overlay district (DHOD) is hereby established with boundaries as shown on Figure 1. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.610 DHOD intent.

The intent of the downtown height overlay district (DHOD) is to protect scenic views on north facing slopes in the vicinity of Sinclair Inlet and downtown, protect property values, provide access to light, ensure that the scale of development in downtown Port Orchard does not negatively impact the historic character of the community, and otherwise protect the general health, safety, and welfare of the community. The intent of the DHOD is to be achieved by establishing height limits for buildings and by establishing a method of measuring buildings that is different than the methods used elsewhere in this title to recognize the generally sloping characteristics of the overlay district. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.620 DHOD applicability.

No new building or modification of an existing building may be permitted in the DHOD unless it complies with the height limits established in this chapter. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.630 DHOD conflicts.

Where the requirements of this chapter conflict with another chapter, the more restrictive requirement shall control. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.640 DHOD height limits.

(1) DHOD Height Zones Established. Within the DHOD as shown on the zoning map, there are three different DHOD height zones with height limits established as follows:

(a) DHOD 3: 38 feet – three stories.

(b) DHOD 4: 48 feet – four stories.

(c) DHOD 5: 58 feet – five stories.

(2) DHOD Height Bonus. A 10-foot (one story) height bonus not to exceed 20,000 feet in area may be granted to exceed the applicable maximum height provided in subsection (1)(a) of this section if the applicant agrees to construct and operate (or lease to an operator) a grocery store in the same building for which the bonus is sought, with the grocery store space measuring at least 10,000 square feet in area. In addition to the 20,000-square-foot bonus limit, the area of this additional 10 feet of building height shall not exceed 95 percent of the area of the floor immediately below this bonus height (floor). Any height bonus shall require a development agreement between the developer and the city that provides assurances to the city guaranteeing that the ground floor commercial space will be developed and operated as a grocery store upon project completion.

(3) DHOD Height Zone Map. The height zones described in this section shall be applied as reflected on the DHOD Height Zone Map as shown in Figure 1.


[IMAGE]


Figure 1: DHOD Height Zone Map

(Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.650 DHOD height measurement.

Building heights shall be measured one of two ways based on whether the parcel to be developed abuts Bay Street or whether it does not abut Bay Street.

(1) Building heights for lots abutting Bay Street shall be measured from the average grade of the property line that abuts Bay Street rather than from the grade plane as defined in Chapter 20.12 POMC (see “building height” and “grade plane”).

(2) Building heights for lots not abutting Bay Street shall be measured in accordance with the definition of building height as found in Chapter 20.12 POMC. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.660 DHOD variances.

Property owners may seek variances from the building height standards imposed under the DHOD pursuant to Chapter 20.28 POMC, Variances. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.670 DHOD map amendments.

Property owners seeking to modify the boundaries of the DHOD or the DHOD Height Zone Map in POMC 20.38.640(3) (Figure 1) may do so by a site-specific rezone pursuant to Chapter 20.42 POMC, Site-Specific Rezones. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.700 Self storage overlay district (SSOD).

A self storage overlay district (SSOD) is hereby established with boundaries as shown on Figure 2.


[IMAGE]


Figure 2: SSOD Map Included Parcels

(Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.710 SSOD intent.

The intent of the self storage overlay district (SSOD) is to limit self-storage uses to areas of the city where the creation of self-storage facilities will not disrupt the creation of new neighborhoods and will allow for the development of mixed use centers. The SSOD identifies locations where self-storage uses will be of a minimum impact, as shown on Figure 2. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.720 SSOD applicability.

No new self-storage facility or expansion of an existing self-storage facility shall be permitted except within the boundaries of the SSOD. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.730 SSOD conflicts.

Where the requirements of this chapter conflict with another chapter, the more restrictive requirement shall control. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.38.740 SSOD map amendments.

Property owners seeking to modify the boundaries of the SSOD as shown on Figure 2 may do so by a site-specific rezone pursuant to Chapter 20.42 POMC, Site-Specific Rezones. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).

Article I. Use Classifications and Table


20.39.010 Use classification.

(1) Classification of Uses.

(a) Organization of Use Tables. The use table in POMC 20.39.040 is organized into principal uses and accessory uses.

(b) Principal Uses.

(i) In order to regulate a variety of similar uses, use categories have been established for principal uses. Use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning uses to appropriate categories with other, similar uses. Use categories classify principal uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics.

(ii) Where a use category contains a list of included uses, the list is to be considered example uses, and not all-inclusive. The director has the responsibility for categorizing all uses.

(iii) The allowed use table in POMC 20.39.040 establishes permitted uses by district. No building or lot may be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which it is located.

(iv) Use definitions and standards for permitted principal uses are specified beginning in POMC 20.39.100.

(v) More than one principal use may be established on a property or in a structure.

(c) Accessory Uses.

(i) An accessory use is any use that is subordinate in both purpose and size, incidental to and customarily associated with a permitted principal use located on the same lot.

(ii) The allowed use table in POMC 20.39.040 establishes permitted accessory uses by district.

(d) Temporary Uses. A temporary use is a use that is in place for a limited period of time only. All uses shall be treated as permanent principal or accessory uses except where temporary uses are specifically authorized in code such as in the Temporary Uses (Chapter 20.58 POMC), Street Use Permits (Chapter 12.24 POMC), Special Events (Chapter 5.94 POMC), or Fireworks (Chapter 5.60 POMC) chapters.

(e) Principal Uses Not Listed.

(i) A principal use not specifically listed is prohibited unless the director determines the use to be part of the use category as described in this chapter.

(ii) The director is responsible for categorizing all principal uses. If a proposed use is not listed in a use category, but is similar to a listed use, the director may consider the proposed use as part of that category. When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the director must consider the criteria in subsection (1)(f) of this section. Determinations whether a proposed principal use is a similar use may be made using the process found in Chapter 20.10 POMC. The director shall determine whether a code interpretation for a proposed principal use shall require a code interpretation pursuant to Chapter 20.10 POMC.

(iii) Where a principal use not listed is found by the director not to be similar to any other use category, the use is only permitted following a code amendment (see Chapter 20.06 POMC).

(f) Criteria for Determining Whether a Proposed Use Is a Similar Use.

(i) The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use;

(ii) The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use;

(iii) Relative amounts of sales;

(iv) Relative number of employees;

(v) Hours of operation;

(vi) Building and site arrangement;

(vii) Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements;

(viii) The number of vehicle trips generated;

(ix) How the proposed use is advertised;

(x) The likely impact on surrounding properties; and

(xi) Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.

(g) Accessory Uses Not Listed.

(i) An accessory use not listed is prohibited unless the director determines that the accessory use meets the criteria listed in subsection (1)(h) of this section.

(ii) Determinations whether a proposed accessory use is a similar use may be made using the process found in subsection (1)(f) of this section. The director shall determine whether a code interpretation for a proposed accessory use shall require a code interpretation pursuant to Chapter 20.10 POMC.

(iii) Where an accessory use not listed is found by the director not to be similar to any other use category, the use is only permitted following a code amendment (see Chapter 20.06 POMC).

(h) Criteria for Determining Whether a Proposed Accessory Use May Be Permitted. The accessory use may be permitted when the director determines the proposed accessory use:

(i) Is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with an allowed principal use;

(ii) Is subordinate to and serving an allowed principal use;

(iii) Is subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to the principal use served;

(iv) Contributes to the comfort, convenience or needs of the occupants, business or industry in the principal use served; and

(v) Is located on the same lot as the principal use served. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.39.020 Establishment of uses.

The use of a property is defined by the activity for which the building or lot is intended, designed, occupied, or maintained. All applicable requirements of this title, or other applicable state or federal requirements, shall govern a use located within the Port Orchard incorporated area. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.39.030 Use table key.

(1) Permitted Use (P). Indicates a use is permitted in the respective zoning district. The use is also subject to all other applicable requirements of this code.

(2) Conditional Use (C). Indicates a use may be permitted in the respective zoning district only after a conditional use permit has been issued per Chapter 20.50 POMC. Conditional uses are subject to all other applicable requirements of this title, including any applicable use standards, except where the use standards are expressly modified in the conditional use permit.

(3) Use Not Permitted (--). Indicates that a use is not permitted in the respective zoning district. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).

20.40.040    Setback encroachments.

20.40.050    Height.

20.40.060    Neighborhood compatibility.


20.40.010 Site and lot dimensions.

(1) Site. A site is any lot or group of contiguous lots owned or controlled by the same person or entity, assembled for the purpose of a single development.

(a) Site Area. Site area is the cumulative area of all contiguous lots that make up the site. Site area does not include existing or proposed right-of-way, whether dedicated or not dedicated to public use.

(b) Site Width. Site width is the cumulative width of all contiguous lots that compose the site.

(c) Site Depth. Site depth is the cumulative depth of all contiguous lots that compose the site.

(2) Lot. A parcel of land either vacant or occupied intended as a unit for the purpose, whether immediate or for the future, of transfer of ownership, or possession, or for development.

(a) Lot Area. Lot area is the area included within the rear, side and front lot lines. Lot area does not include existing or proposed right-of-way, whether dedicated or not dedicated to public use. Minimum lot area may not include constrained land such as wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat area, floodways and floodplains, and slopes over 25 percent which are 2,000 square feet or more of contiguous sloped area. Where on-site waste treatment is required, health department standards will determine whether minimum lot area must be increased to accommodate the on-site waste treatment system.

(b) Lot Width. Lot width is the distance between the two side lot lines measured at the primary street property line along a straight line or along the chord of the property line on a curvilinear lot. For irregularly shaped lots or flag lots, lot width may determined by measuring the diameter of the largest circle that can be drawn within the lot’s boundaries.

(c) Lot Frontage. Every lot must abut a public or private street, or a courtyard specifically for a cottage court building type.

(d) Lot, Flag. A lot with less length of property on a public street than is normally required, with no less than 15 feet abutting a public or private street generally intended to make deeper property accessible.
[IMAGE]


(3) Hard Surface Coverage. The area of the lot that is covered by buildings, including both principal structures, structured parking and roofed accessory structures, including gazebos. Hard surface coverage also includes paved and gravel areas such as driveways, walkways, uncovered porches or patios, decks, swimming pools, parking lots, and roof overhangs of over two feet, driveways, walkways, steps, terraces and uncovered decks. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.40.020 Building setbacks.

(1) Type of Setbacks. There are four types of setbacks – primary street, side street, side interior and rear. Building setbacks apply to both principal and accessory buildings or structures except where it is explicitly stated otherwise.

(2) Measurement of Setbacks.

(a) The primary street setback is measured at a right angle from the primary street right-of-way line, or, from the proposed boundary line of a right-of-way acquisition area if area is included in an approved right-of-way acquisition plan.

(b) On corner lots, the side street setback is measured at a right angle from the side street right-of-way line.

(c) The rear setback is measured at a right angle from the rear property line or the rear right-of-way or easement line where there is an alley. The rear property line is the property line opposite to the primary street property line. Where there is more than one primary street, the director will determine the rear property line based on the criteria in subsection (4) of this section.

(d) All lot lines which are not primary street, side street or rear lot lines are considered side interior lot lines for the purpose of measuring setbacks. Side interior setbacks are measured at a right angle from the side property line.

(3) Irregular Shaped Lots. The director will determine setbacks for irregularly shaped lots.
[IMAGE]


(4) Primary/Side Street Designation.

(a) Where only one street abuts a lot, that street is considered a primary street.

(b) A multiple street frontage lot must designate at least one primary street. A lot may have more than one primary street. The director will determine which streets are primary streets based on (where applicable):

(i) The street or streets with the highest classification (highest classification is principal arterial, lowest is local access);

(ii) The established orientation of the block;

(iii) The street or streets abutting the longest face of the block;

(iv) The street or streets parallel to an alley within the block;

(v) The street that the lot takes its address from; and

(vi) The pedestrian orientation of adjacent or abutting development, existing or proposed.

(5) Primary Setback Averaging. The primary street setback requirements for principal buildings in R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 zones may be averaged as follows:

(a) The proposed building must be located within the range of primary street setbacks, no closer than the smallest setback in the range and no further than the largest setback in the range.

(b) On an interior lot, the range of setbacks is measured on the basis of the two closest lots in either direction along the block face.
[IMAGE]


(c) On a corner lot, the range of setbacks is measured on the basis of the three closest lots along the block face.
[IMAGE]


(d) Where the calculation cannot be applied to at least four lots on an interior lot or three lots on a corner lot, the building must meet the district standards. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.40.030 Build-to zone.

(1) Build-to Zone. The build-to zone is the area on the lot where a certain percentage of the front building facade must be located, measured as a minimum and maximum setback range from the edge of the right-of-way.

(2) Build-to Zone on Interior Lots. The required percentage specifies the amount of the front building facade that must be located in the build-to zone, measured based on the width of the building divided by the width of the lot.
[IMAGE]


(3) Build-to Zone on Corner Lots. On a corner lot, a building facade must be placed within the build-to zone for the first 30 feet along the street extending from the block corner, measured from the intersection of the two right-of-way lines.
[IMAGE]


(4) Build-to Zone – Uses Allowed. With the exception of parking spaces and outdoor storage, all structures and uses (including outdoor dining) allowed on the lot are allowed in the build-to zone.

(5) The director may reduce the build-to-zone percentage requirements where any combination of landscape buffer requirements, minimum driveway width requirements, critical area requirements, or other regulatory limitations result in unachievable build-to-zone requirements. An example of a situation that would warrant a build-to-zone percentage reduction is shown below:


[IMAGE]


(Ord. 056-19 § 18; Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).

Chapter 20.41 TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS PROGRAM

Sections:

20.41.010    Purpose.

20.41.020    Authority.

20.41.030    Applicability.

20.41.040    General requirements.

20.41.050    Sending areas.

20.41.060    Sending site calculations.

20.41.070    Receiving areas.

20.41.080    Use of transferred development rights.


20.41.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to create a process for certification and transfer of transferable development rights from designated sending areas within Kitsap County to designated receiving areas within Port Orchard that are zoned for multifamily residential development (apartment buildings). The transfer of development rights from one property within Kitsap County to another within Port Orchard is allowed in order to provide the following:

(1) Flexibility and efficient use of land and building techniques;

(2) Preservation of rural character, promotion of farming areas, and provision of long-term open space opportunities; and

(3) A mechanism to work toward achieving policies outlined in the Kitsap County countywide planning policies, Kitsap County comprehensive plan, the Port Orchard comprehensive plan and Port Orchard development regulations. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.41.020 Authority.

The transfer of transferable development rights (“TDR”) system for Port Orchard is established. The base residential density of a sending site within Kitsap County may be transferred and credited to a receiving site within the city of Port Orchard in accordance with this chapter only when a TDR certificate is issued in accordance with the rules and procedures in this chapter and in Kitsap County Code Chapter 17.580. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.41.030 Applicability.

This chapter supplements city and county land use regulations and other land protection efforts by establishing a TDR process, which may be employed at a landowner’s option to certify and transfer development rights from an eligible sending site in Kitsap County to an eligible receiving site in Port Orchard, and which may include transfer through an open market or TDR bank. This chapter regulates the following with respect to the transfer of development rights:

(1) Provides a conversion formula to convert county development rights into city building height bonuses;

(2) Provides a market-based TDR implementation system based on the issuance of TDR certificates by Kitsap County that may be freely sold or otherwise transferred for use in the city of Port Orchard; and

(3) Requires the recording of conservation easements that restrict development on sending sites within Kitsap County. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.41.040 General requirements.

(1) Development Rights. Residential development rights are considered to be interests in real property.

(2) Transfer of Development Rights Permitted. The number of dwelling units allowed to be constructed on a sending parcel within Kitsap County under Kitsap County Code Section 17.580.050 may be transferred to a receiving parcel within the city of Port Orchard pursuant to the conversion provided in subsection (3) of this section. In approving a transfer of development rights to a receiving area within Port Orchard, the decision-maker (depending on permit type) must find that such a transfer is permitted under and consistent with the zoning applicable to the receiving property. A transfer of development rights is allowed only under the provisions in this chapter.

(3) Transfer of Development Rights Conversion Formula. Each development right (i.e., allowed dwelling units) sent from a sending area in Kitsap County shall be worth a one-story (10-foot) height bonus measuring 2,000 square feet on the receiving property within Port Orchard. To illustrate this conversion, if a mixed use storefront building (e.g., with retail on the ground floor and apartments on higher floors) in Port Orchard is proposed with a building footprint of 20,000 square feet at four stories, but the zone allows for a height bonus pursuant to the TDR program to increase that height to five stories, the purchase of 10 development rights from Kitsap County would allow one additional 10-foot story measuring 20,000 square feet, thus increasing the allowed height of the proposed building from four to five stories. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.41.050 Sending areas.

(1) The city of Port Orchard will rely on Kitsap County sending area designations in place as of March 12, 2019, and additionally shall only accept development rights transferred from properties located in zip codes 98366, 98367, 98312, and 98359, in accordance with Kitsap County Code Chapter 17.580.

(2) Land already encumbered by a conservation easement shall not be eligible as a TDR sending site.

(3) Any land below ordinary high water of any fresh or saltwater body shall not be eligible as a TDR sending site.

(4) Development rights allocated to eligible sending sites may be converted to TDR certificates which may be transferred to eligible receiving sites through the TDR transfer process. After completion of the conveyance of a sending site’s development rights, the property shall be maintained in a condition that is consistent with the TDR conservation easement imposed under Kitsap County Code Section 17.580.100. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.41.060 Sending site calculations.

The city of Port Orchard shall rely on Kitsap County calculations of development rights eligible for transfer from a sending site pursuant to Kitsap County Code Chapter 17.580. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.41.070 Receiving areas.

The following map shows eligible TDR receiving areas in which height bonuses allowing buildings to be constructed up to eight stories not to exceed 88 feet may be constructed. The eight-story/88-foot height limit allowed for properties shown on the map supersedes the height limits in Chapters 20.34 and 20.35 POMC.


[IMAGE]


(Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.41.080 Use of transferred development rights.

Once development rights have been obtained in accordance with Kitsap County Code Chapter 17.580, the county will issue certificate(s) certifying the number of rights purchased and the location from which the rights are being sent. Applicants seeking to use the issued Kitsap County certificate(s) shall submit the certificate(s) with their development permit application for a project to be constructed on an eligible suitably zoned property within Port Orchard. Prior to permit issuance for a project that has been approved pursuant to a TDR height bonus, the certificate shall be conveyed to the city of Port Orchard and extinguished in exchange for the approved height bonus. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).

(d) A description of any alternatives or proposed changes to the rezone.

(3) SEPA Review. The director or SEPA official shall conduct a SEPA review and notify applicants as to the need for a SEPA checklist and environmental impact statement. Applicants will be responsible for any fees associated with SEPA analysis.

(4) Public Participation. The city shall provide notice and opportunity for public comment, as deemed appropriate given the nature of the proposed rezone.

(5) Hearing Examiner. The hearing examiner shall hold a noticed public hearing on proposed site-specific rezones and make a recommendation to the city council as to whether the proposed rezone meets the criteria in POMC 20.42.030.

(6) City Council Action. The city council shall consider the hearing examiner’s recommendation and may hold an additional hearing on the site-specific rezone application at its discretion. The city council’s approval, modification, deferral, or denial of a site-specific rezone application shall be based on the criteria set forth in POMC 20.42.030. If a quasi-judicial rezone is approved, the city council will subsequently adopt an ordinance amending the city’s official zoning map to be consistent with their final decision on the rezone application.

(7) Development Agreements. A site-specific rezone may be approved subject to the execution, delivery, and recording of a development agreement between the property owner, or the legal owner of a beneficial interest in the property to be rezoned, and the city and pursuant to Chapter 20.26 POMC. The development agreement may include restrictions upon the use and development of the property, which shall apply in addition to the development regulations in the underlying zone. Such restrictions are imposed in order to ameliorate adverse impacts that could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted by the development regulations otherwise applicable after approval of the site-specific rezone. 

All restrictions imposed by the development agreement shall be directly related to the impacts that may be expected to result from the site-specific rezone. The approval of the map amendment will then be conditioned upon performance or compliance with the terms and conditions of the development agreement. The city may revoke a site-specific rezone executed with a development agreement (or take any other action allowed by law) for the property owner’s failure to comply with the development agreement. An applicant proposing a site-specific rezone with a development agreement shall submit the proposed development agreement with the application materials described in POMC 20.42.020. The city shall consolidate the processing of the quasi-judicial rezone application and proposed development agreement (see Chapter 20.26 POMC on development agreements). (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.42.050 Expiration. 

(1) A site-specific rezone approval with or without a development agreement shall expire three years from the effective date of the approval, unless:

(a) If, prior to the end of the three-year period, an application determined to be complete is filed for a building permit and/or site development activity permit that is subsequently issued; or 

(b) Another time for expiration is specified in the final decision of the city council or development agreement. 

(2) Upon expiration of a site-specific rezone, the city council shall promptly pass an ordinance to amend the official land use map so that the zoning designation in effect immediately prior to the site-specific rezone approval is reinstated for the subject property, except as otherwise expressly provided in the original ordinance adopting the site-specific rezone. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Chapter 20.50 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

Sections:

20.50.010    Purpose.

20.50.020    Administration and procedure.

20.50.030    Requirements for complete application.

20.50.040    Site plan.

20.50.050    Criteria for approval.

20.50.060    Deadline for final decision.

20.50.070    Effect of approval.

20.50.080    Expiration, extensions and permit implementation.


20.50.010 Purpose. 

(1) It is the intent of this chapter to provide a process to allow for uses that are not permitted outright within a zone. Such uses typically require a special degree of control to make sure they are consistent with the intent of the zone and compatible with other existing and permitted uses within the zone. Accordingly, these uses require a discretionary, case-by-case review and analysis for the possible imposition of conditions to mitigate the adverse effects of the use. These are identified as “conditional uses.” The purpose of this chapter is to provide standards and procedures under which a conditional use may be permitted, enlarged, or altered, if the site is appropriate and if other appropriate conditions of approval can be met. 

(2) A conditional use permit shall not replace the variance procedure in Chapter 20.28 POMC or be used to permit uses that are prohibited within the zone. If a variance is desired for the same property upon which a conditional use permit is required, the variance application may be filed in conjunction with the conditional use permit application, and the two applications will be processed concurrently. 

(3) A use that was legally established but is now permitted only as a conditional use is not a nonconforming use and will be regulated as if a conditional use permit had earlier been granted. 

(4) For properties within the city’s shoreline zone, the standards of the city’s shoreline master program also apply, and a shoreline conditional use permit may also be concurrently required. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.50.020 Administration and procedure. 

(1) The planning director is authorized and directed to administer the provisions of this chapter relating to conditional use permits. 

(2) An application for a conditional use permit shall be reviewed in accordance with Chapter 20.22 POMC as a Type III decision.

(3) The hearing examiner shall have the authority to grant the request for approval of a conditional use permit. When considering a request for a conditional use permit, the hearing examiner shall consider the applicable criteria, standards, intent, and policies established by this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.50.030 Requirements for complete application.

In addition to the requirements for a complete application as set forth in Chapter 20.24 POMC, the following materials shall be submitted to the city for a complete application for a conditional use permit. Refer to the relevant city application form for numbers of copies of each item that must be included and the type of accompanying electronic submittal that is required (if relevant).

(1) Seven copies of a completed application form (including all supporting documents) signed by the property owner(s) and/or applicant;

(2) Date, name, address, telephone number and email of the applicant;

(3) Name, address, telephone number and email of the owner of the property identified in the application; 

(4) A statement that the applicant attests by written oath to the accuracy and completeness of all information submitted for an application;

(5) A site plan meeting the requirements of the submittal checklist, which at a minimum shall include the information in POMC 20.50.040;

(6) Applicable filing fee(s), if any, as established in the current city of Port Orchard fee schedule and relevant deposit(s), if any, as permitted or required by other chapters or sections of the POMC;

(7) Any additional information as required by the applicable submittal checklist or other chapters of this title for the proposed use, or as indicated by city staff at a preapplication meeting. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.50.040 Site plan. 

(1) The site plan required by POMC 20.50.030 shall include the following information:

(a) Vicinity map;

(b) Name, address, phone number of property owner;

(c) Name, address, phone number of engineer or agent;

(d) Boundaries and dimensions of property;

(e) Adjacent public streets;

(f) Easements, existing and proposed;

(g) Location and size of all existing and proposed utilities;

(h) Location of building(s), including setbacks;

(i) Building/structure heights;

(j) Location and layout of off-street parking;

(k) Location and height of fences;

(l) Locations and size of signs;

(m) A general lighting plan showing proposed lighting types and location including proposed shielding methods. Landscape detailing including, but not limited to, type and location of vegetation, initial and mature planting sizes, and methods of irrigation.

(2) The submitted site plan shall be adopted and be made part of any approved conditional use permit. For the duration of the conditional use permit, subsequently issued building permits and construction activity shall be in accord with the approved site plan.

(3) Adjustments to the site plan may be approved after conditional use permit approval as follows:

(a) Minor Adjustments. Minor adjustments to the site plan may be made and approved by the planning director or designee. Minor adjustments are those which may affect the precise dimensions or siting of buildings, but which do not affect the basic character or arrangement of buildings approved, nor the development coverage of the development or the open space requirements. Such dimensional adjustments shall not vary more than 10 percent from the original site plan. Minor adjustments may include revisions to landscaping provided that the landscaping plan complies with the landscape code and the permit conditions of approval.

(b) Major Adjustments. Major adjustments are those adjustments, other than minor adjustments, when determined by the planning director or designee, that substantially change the basic design, coverage, open space or other requirements of the conditional use permit, and/or would result in noncompliance with one or more permit conditions of approval. When the planning director or designee determines a change constitutes a major adjustment, no building or other permit shall be issued for the use without prior review and approval of such adjustment pursuant to this section.

The submittal requirements and review and approval process for a major adjustment to the site plan of an approved conditional use permit shall be substantially the same as that required for the original conditional use permit. An application for major adjustment meeting the information requirements of POMC 20.50.030 shall be submitted. At the discretion of the planning director or designee, the applicant may be able to resubmit or incorporate by reference some portions of the original conditional use permit submittal as part of the application for a major adjustment; however, the application for major adjustment shall be subject to the same submittal, fees, processing, and findings of fact requirements of this chapter for conditional use permits, as applicable. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.50.050 Criteria for approval.

(1) Hearing Examiner Findings. The hearing examiner shall not grant a conditional use permit unless the hearing examiner finds that the request meets all of the following criteria and the hearing examiner makes written findings to that effect: 

(a) That the conditional use is consistent with the objectives of the zoning code and the purpose of the zoning district in which the subject site/property is located;

(b) Granting the conditional use will not have a substantively greater adverse effect on the health, safety or welfare of persons living or working in the area and will not be substantively more injurious, economically or otherwise, to property or improvements in the surrounding area than would any use generally permitted in the zone. Among matters to be considered are traffic flow and control, access to and circulation within the property, off-street parking and loading, refuse and service area, utilities, screening and buffering, signs, yards and other open spaces, height, bulk, and location of structures, location of proposed open space uses, hours and manner of operation, and noise, lights, dust, odor, fumes, and vibration; 

(c) The proposal is in accordance with the goals, policies, and objectives of the comprehensive plan;

(d) The proposal complies with all requirements of this title;

(e) The conditional use will be supported by adequate public facilities or services and will not adversely affect public services to the surrounding area, or conditions can be established to mitigate adverse impacts on such facilities; and

(f) Existing conditions of approval required as part of a prior land division or permit shall be met.

(2) Conditions of Approval. The hearing examiner may impose specific conditions upon the use, including increasing the standards of this title, which are found necessary to find that the required approval criteria in this section have been met. Possible conditions on use include, but are not limited to: 

(a) Limiting the hours, days, place and/or manner of operation;

(b) Requiring site or architectural design features which minimize environmental impacts such as noise, vibration, exhaust/emissions, light, glare, erosion, odor and/or dust;

(c) Requiring larger setback areas, lot area, and/or lot depth or width;

(d) Limiting the building or structure height, size or lot coverage, and/or location on the site;

(e) Designating the size, number, location and/or design of vehicle access points or parking areas;

(f) Requiring street right-of-way to be dedicated to the public and street(s), sidewalks, bicycle facilities, curbs, planting strips, pathways or trails to be improved;

(g) Requiring landscaping, screening, drainage, water quality features and/or improvement of parking and loading areas;

(h) Limiting the number, size, location, height and/or lighting of signs;

(i) Limiting or setting standards for the location, design and/or intensity of outdoor lighting;

(j) Requiring berms, screening or landscaping and the establishment of standards for their installation and maintenance;

(k) Requiring and designating the size, height, location and/or materials for fences; and

(l) Requiring the protection and preservation of existing trees, soils, vegetation, watercourses, habitat areas, drainage areas, historic resources, cultural resources, and/or sensitive lands. 

(3) Denial. The director may recommend conditioning or denial of the conditional use permit application based on RCW 43.21C.060 (SEPA).1 In addition, the hearing examiner may deny the conditional use permit if he/she determines that the proposed use does not meet the criteria in this section and/or is materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.50.060 Deadline for final decision.

A conditional use permit application shall be approved, approved with conditions, remanded or denied within 120 days after the application has been determined complete, unless the applicant consents in writing to a longer processing time period. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.50.070 Effect of approval.

(1) Applies to Authorized Use Only. Issuance of a conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it is issued. If a quasi-judicial zoning map amendment that does not allow the conditional use is subsequently approved for the site, the use will be allowed to continue subject to the terms and conditions of the conditional use permit. 

(2) Binding on Subsequent Owners. All conditions of approval shall be binding upon the applicant, their successors and assigns; shall run with the land; shall limit and control the issuance and validity of certificates of occupancy; and shall restrict and limit the construction, location, use and maintenance of all land and structures within the development. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.50.080 Expiration, extensions and permit implementation.

(1) A conditional use permit shall become null and void three years after the effective date, unless one of the following has occurred: 

(a) A building permit and/or site development activity permit has issued and construction and/or site development begun and diligently pursued;

(b) An occupancy permit has issued and the approved use has been established;

(c) An extension has been granted by the planning director. Such extension shall be for a maximum of one year, and no extension may be granted which would extend the validity of the permit more than five years beyond the effective date of the permit. No extension will be granted if it necessitates modification of any condition of approval; or 

(d) The hearing examiner’s decision on the conditional use permit has established a different expiration date, such as tying it to the expiration of a quasi-judicial map amendment for the same property.

(2) Development of the conditional use shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits and approvals required by the city, or any applicable regional, state and federal agencies. 

(3) Any conditional use that has been initiated and then discontinued may not be reestablished or recommenced except pursuant to a new conditional use permit. The following will constitute conclusive evidence that the conditional use has been discontinued: 

(a) A new permit has been issued to change the use of the lot and the new use has been established; or 

(b) The lot has not been used for the purpose authorized by the conditional use permit for more than 24 consecutive months. Lots that are vacant, or that are used only for storage of materials and equipment, will not be considered as being used for the purpose authorized by the conditional use. The expiration or revocation of a business or other license necessary for the conditional use to operate will suffice as evidence that the lot is not being used as authorized by the conditional use permit. 

(4) Pursuant to POMC 20.02.060, failure to carry out conditions of CUP approval shall constitute a violation of this code. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).1

 In order to deny an application under SEPA, the city must find that: (1) the proposal would result in significant adverse impacts identified in a final or supplemental environmental impact statement prepared under Chapter 43.21C RCW; and (2) reasonable mitigation measures are insufficient to mitigate the identified impact.

20.54.010 Purpose.

This chapter provides standards and procedures for identifying nonconforming situations, establishing restrictions on the alteration or expansion of a nonconforming situation, and it also specifies when a nonconforming situation must be brought into compliance with the code. In addition, this chapter also establishes an optional process for a property owner to obtain a determination that a building, use or lot is legally nonconforming so that the property owner may use such determination for purposes of property sale/transfer, or to defend in a code enforcement action. For properties within the city’s shoreline zone, the standards of the city’s shoreline master program also apply, including regulations for nonconforming uses and structures within the shoreline zone. For nonconforming signs, please also see Chapter 20.132 POMC. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.020 Definitions.

(1) Nonconforming Building Type. A nonconforming building type is a building type which lawfully existed in a zoning district prior to the adoption of this zoning code, but which is not one of the building types allowed in the current zoning district pursuant to Chapter 20.32 POMC.

(2) Nonconforming Lot. A nonconforming lot is a lot which lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this zoning code, but which does not comply with one or more of the lot standards for the applicable zoning district in the current code, such as minimum lot size, minimum lot width or required access.

(3) Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use is a use which lawfully existed in a zoning district prior to the adoption of this zoning code, but which is not one of the uses that is permitted or conditionally permitted in the current zoning district per Chapter 20.39 POMC.

(4) Nonconforming Structure. A nonconforming structure is a structure which lawfully existed in a zoning district prior to the adoption of this zoning code, but which does not comply with one or more requirements for the applicable zoning district in the current code for maximum height, minimum setbacks, maximum lot coverage or impervious surface coverage, or design standards. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.030 Establishing a legal nonconforming building type, lot, use or structure for the record.

(1) Permit Required. A landowner may establish that he/she has a legal nonconforming building type, use or structure for the record by obtaining the permit described in POMC 20.54.080. This process is optional in situations other than code enforcement actions (in which the landowner may choose to utilize the process in order to establish the legality of the nonconforming building type, use or structure).

(2) Abandonment or Discontinuance. In order to establish a legal nonconforming building type, use or structure, the use or structure must not have been abandoned or discontinued, under the criteria in POMC 20.54.050(4).

(3) Destruction. Should a nonconforming building type, structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of its destruction, as determined by the city building official, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with this code, and only under the following conditions: (a) a complete application for a building permit (or other applicable permit) is filed with the city within 12 months after the damage occurred, and the permit issues, with not more than one 180-day extension; (b) the cause of the damage or destruction was not the willful act of the owner or the owner’s agent; and (c) the cause of the damage or destruction was not due to the ongoing neglect of the owner or the owner’s agent.

(4) Enforcement. If a landowner is not able to establish a legally nonconforming building type, use or structure, or, if the city proves that a legal nonconforming building type, use or structure was abandoned or discontinued, then the building type, use or structure may be subject to an enforcement action. In this enforcement action, the landowner will either be required to terminate the use, demolish the building or other structure or conform the building or other structure to the requirements of this code, including the provisions of Chapter 20.02 POMC, Administration and Enforcement.

(5) Applicability of New Regulations to Legal Nonconforming Building Types, Uses and Structures. Legal nonconforming building types, uses and structures have only a vested right not to have the building type, use or structure or other development immediately terminated when a new code provision is adopted that prohibits the building type, use or structure. The building type, use or structure may still be subject to newly adopted reasonable police power regulations.

A legal use of land does not become nonconforming because the zone in which it is located is changed to a zoning district which requires a conditional use permit for the use. However, any alteration, expansion or intensification of a use previously approved as a conditional use must follow the process in Chapter 20.50 POMC for approval of a new conditional use permit unless the zoning changes such that the use is now permitted outright. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.040 Establishing a legal nonconforming lot for the record.

(1) Permit Required. A landowner may establish that he/she has a legal nonconforming lot for the record by obtaining the permit described in POMC 20.54.080 through 20.54.140. This process is optional in situations other than code enforcement actions.

(2) Enforcement. If a landowner is not able to establish a legally nonconforming lot, then the lot may be subject to an enforcement action. In this enforcement action, the landowner will either be required to establish a legally conforming lot through subdivision, boundary line adjustment, legal adjudication or other legally-accepted method of lot creation, or else abandon the claim to ownership of a legal lot of record, subject to the requirements of this code.

(3) Applicability of New Regulations to Legal Nonconforming Lots. Legal nonconforming lots have only a vested right not to have any use, structure or other development immediately terminated when a new code provision is adopted which creates or increases the nonconformity of a lot. The lot may still be subject to newly adopted reasonable police power regulations. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.050 Restrictions on legal nonconforming uses.

(1) Enlargement, Increase, Intensification and Extension Prohibited. A legal nonconforming use may not be enlarged, increased, intensified or extended to occupy a greater area of land or space, including air space, than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code. No additional structure, building or sign shall be constructed on the lot in connection with such nonconforming use of land.

(2) Use Cannot Be Moved to New Location. No legal nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the building or any lot other than that occupied by such use except where that use is permitted outright at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code.

(3) Change in Use. A nonconforming use cannot be changed to another nonconforming use. A change in tenancy or ownership is not considered a change to another nonconforming use; provided, that the use itself remains unchanged.

(4) No Discontinuation or Abandonment. In order to retain its legally nonconforming status, the legal nonconforming use of land cannot be discontinued or abandoned for any reason for a period of more than 180 days, or for 18 months in a three-year period. For purposes of calculating the 180-day or 18-month period, a use is discontinued or abandoned upon the occurrence of the first of any of the following events:

(a) On the date when the use of land is physically vacated;

(b) On the date the use ceases to be actively involved in the sale of merchandise or the provision of services;

(c) On the date of termination of any lease or contract under which the nonconforming use has occupied the land; or

(d) On the date a request for final reading of water and power meters is made to the applicable utility districts.

(5) Uses which vary seasonally (such as agricultural uses) shall be deemed abandoned if the seasonal use is not utilized during one full season, consistent with the traditional use.

(6) Application of Code Criteria and Standards. If the use is discontinued or abandoned for any reason (other than seasonal use as allowed by subsection (5) of this section) for a period of more than 180 days or for 18 months in a three-year period, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the applicable standards and criteria specified by this code for the land use zone in which such land is located. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.060 Restrictions on legal nonconforming building types and structures.

(1) Alterations and Maintenance. A nonconforming building type or structure may not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be enlarged or altered in a way that satisfies the current requirements of this code or in a way that will not increase its nonconformity. Ordinary maintenance and repair shall be permitted.

(2) Roadway Access. The owner of a nonconforming access connection (i.e., street or highway access) may be required to bring the nonconforming access into conformance with this code and other applicable standards as a condition of the city or other roadway authority approving a new access connection permit, or a landowner’s requested change in land use.

(3) Relocation or Removal. Should the nonconforming building type or structure be moved for any reason and by any distance, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of this code. However, a structure may be moved on the same site without full compliance if the movement reduces the building type’s or structure’s degree of nonconformity with the code.

(4) Historic Buildings and Structures. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the full restoration by reconstruction of a building or structure which is either listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Washington State Register of Historic Places, or the Washington State Cultural Resource Inventory, as shown in a historical survey meeting the standards of the State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. “Restoration” means reconstruction of the historic building or structure with as nearly the same visual design appearance and materials as is consistent with full compliance with the State Building Code and any code provisions adopted by the city on the subject of historic preservation. The reconstruction of all such historic buildings and structures shall comply with the life safety provisions of the State Building Code.

(5) Mobile Homes or Manufactured Homes. Any mobile home or manufactured home located in a residential district which is a legal nonconforming use may be replaced with an approved manufactured home that conforms to the applicable requirements of this title. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.070 Restrictions on legal nonconforming lots.

(1) A nonconforming lot may not be altered in size or shape in any way that increases its nonconformity, but it may be altered in a way that satisfies the current requirements of this code or in a way that will not increase its nonconformity.

(2) Use of Legal Nonconforming Lot as a Building Site. A legal nonconforming lot may be used as a building site; provided, that all other requirements of the applicable zoning district are met or a variance is obtained. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.080 Permit required.

A property owner may obtain a nonconforming permit to establish a legal nonconforming building type, lot, use or structure for the record. This permit is not required, unless the city has brought a code enforcement action relating to the property, or if the property owner desires the permit for another purpose, such as to obtain a building permit consistent with the desired legal nonconforming building type, lot, use or structure. In such event, the property owner has the burden to follow the procedures set forth herein to establish that the condition of the property is legally nonconforming. In the case of a code enforcement action, the director may place the code enforcement action in abeyance for a reasonable time in order to allow a property owner to gather the necessary information to demonstrate that the property is legally nonconforming. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.090 Administration of nonconforming permits.

(1) The following steps shall be followed in the processing of nonconforming permits:

(a) Determination of complete application (POMC 20.24.050);

(b) Determination of consistency (POMC 20.24.090);

(c) Notice of decision by director (POMC 20.24.100); and

(d) Administrative appeal, if any (open record hearing, POMC 20.22.040).

(2) Because the processing of these permit applications requires the submission of different information for approval, imposes different burdens on the applicant and the city, and varies in other material respects from the processing of a project permit application, these permits are exempt under RCW 36.70B.140 from all project permit processing requirements (identified in Chapter 20.22 POMC), other than those set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.100 Requirements for a complete application.

A complete application for a nonconforming permit shall include the following items as applicable to each classification of nonconformity (building type, lot, use, structure). Refer to the relevant city application form for numbers of copies of each item that must be included and the type of accompanying electronic submittal that is required (if relevant):

(1) Completed application form;

(2) Date, name, address, telephone number and email of the applicant;

(3) Name, address, telephone number and email of the owner of the property identified in the application;

(6) Information demonstrating that (a) the building type, structure or use is not permitted outright under the city’s code, including, but not limited to, the use standards of the current zoning or applicable district; (b) the current zoning code or building code standards for the building type, lot, use or structure are not met; and (c) the use has not been abandoned or discontinued for the period identified in this chapter;

(7) Proof of legal nonconforming status, including, but not limited to, planning permits/approvals, building permits, leases, aerial maps showing the structure and footprint, listings in business or phone directories (or directory with a list of businesses and residents referenced by address), etc.;

20.54.110 Criteria for approval – Permit to establish legal nonconforming building type, use or structure for the record.

(1) Criteria. A permit will be approved establishing the legal nonconforming status of the building type, use or structure if the applicant provides sufficient evidence and demonstrates to the director’s satisfaction:

(a) That the building type, use or structure satisfies the definition for a legal nonconforming building type, use or structure in this chapter; and

(b) That the building type, use or structure has been in existence and maintained continuously, with no interruption that would constitute abandonment or discontinuance under either former or current city codes.

(2) Acceptable Documentation. The evidence presented by the applicant may include, but is not limited to, the following as documentation of the existence of a building type, use or structure from a time when it would have been permitted outright and as documentation of its uninterrupted continuation:

(a) Signed written statements from persons having no financial interest in the property and who are not relatives of the applicant or property owner. Notarization is not required.

(b) Occupancy listing from the Polk directory or reverse telephone directories.

(c) Business and/or licensing records.

(d) County records showing the previous permitted use if the property was formerly not part of the city.

(e) Assessment records.

(f) Evidence of more than one electric or gas meter or sewer hookup.

(g) Other evidence that the director deems useful and reliable, based on the circumstances of the individual case. Examples include, but are not limited to, photographs, U.S. Census reports, and signed written statements of experts.

(3) It is the responsibility of the applicant to furnish at least two different types of documentation from the sources listed above. The city may, in its discretion, require further documentation if the documentation submitted by the applicant does not demonstrate the existence of the building type, use or structure from a time when it was permitted outright, or fails to show continuous, uninterrupted maintenance of the use. The city may also accept only one type of documentation from the sources listed above, if that documentation is particularly persuasive. Any number of written, signed statements, however, are not sufficient by themselves to document the existence of a building type, use or structure. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.120 Criteria for approval – Permit to establish legal nonconforming lot for the record.

(1) Criteria. A permit will be approved establishing the legal nonconforming status of a lot if the applicant provides sufficient evidence and demonstrates to the director’s satisfaction that the lot was lawfully created and recorded with the county auditor’s office.

(2) Acceptable Documentation. The evidence presented by the applicant may include, but is not limited to, a recorded subdivision, large lot subdivision, testamentary subdivision (provided, that the testamentary subdivision conformed to zoning at the time of recording), short plat or binding site plan; a recorded boundary line adjustment approved by the city if such approval was required at the time of recording; or a legal adjudication requiring the creation of the lot with subsequent recording with the county auditor’s office. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.130 Final decision on nonconforming permit.

Because the city has excluded nonconforming permits from the procedures set forth in RCW 36.70B.140, there is no deadline for the city’s issuance of a final decision. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.140 Appeals of nonconforming permit.

A nonconforming permit is a Type I decision per POMC 20.22.020. If an appeal of the director’s decision is filed, the procedures in POMC 20.22.030(7) and (8) shall be followed. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.54.150 Nonconformities and build-to zone requirements.

“Build-to zone” requirements may apply to certain development proposals in residential, commercial and mixed use zoning designations. For information on build-to zone requirements and their applicability to a proposal, refer to Chapters 20.34 and 20.35 POMC.

(1) Building Additions. When an existing building is being expanded and the building does not meet the build-to requirement, the following provisions apply:

(a) Front. Any addition to the front of the building must be placed in the build-to zone. The addition does not have to meet the build-to percentage for the lot.

(b) Rear. Rear additions are allowed because the addition does not increase the degree of the nonconformity.

(c) Side. Side additions are not allowed because the extension increases the width that is not located in the build-to zone.

(2) New Buildings. When a new building is proposed on a site with an existing building that does not meet the build-to requirement, the following provisions apply:

(a) Front. All new buildings must be placed in the build-to zone until the build-to percentage for the lot has been met.

(b) Rear. New buildings located outside of the build-to zone are not allowed until the build-to percentage for the lot has been met.

(c) Side. New buildings located outside of the build-to zone are not allowed until the build-to percentage for the lot has been met. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).

20.60.040    Home businesses – Requirements.

20.60.050    Revocation of home business license.


20.60.010 Purpose. 

The purpose of the home business regulations is to balance the competing interests of persons wishing to engage in limited commercial activity within residences with those of their neighbors in maintaining the residential character of the neighborhood. These provisions have therefore been enacted to ensure that all commercial activity remains incidental to the residential use and does not interfere with the residential character of the neighborhood through noise, traffic, safety hazards, or other public nuisances that may be generated by the commercial activity. It is the express intent of the city to not create a commercial atmosphere in its residential zones while allowing small commercial pursuits suitable for a residential neighborhood. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.60.020 Definition – Home business. 

The term “home business” or “home businesses” shall include home (cottage) industry, home occupation and home profession as defined in Chapter 20.12 POMC. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.60.030 Business license required. 

No person shall operate or maintain a home business without having a license to do so issued by the city treasurer in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and with the provisions of Chapter 5.12 POMC. The specific provisions of this chapter shall control over any conflicting provisions of Chapter 5.12 POMC. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.60.040 Home businesses – Requirements. 

(1) Home businesses are permitted in a residential dwelling unit subject to the provisions of the city’s zoning ordinance and if all of the following criteria are met:

(a) The home business shall clearly be subordinate to the use of the dwelling unit for residential purposes. The burden of establishing that the home business is subordinate to the primary residential use is upon the applicant for a business license.

(b) The home business shall be owned or conducted by a resident of the dwelling unit. If the applicant for the business license is a resident but does not own the dwelling unit, the applicant shall obtain written approval of the proposed home business from the owner. The burden of establishing that the home business is owned or conducted by a resident of the dwelling unit is upon the applicant for a business license.

(c) No more than one person who is not a resident shall be employed in the home business without obtaining a conditional use permit.

(d) If more than one home business is proposed to be located or conducted within any single dwelling unit, including accessory structures, and a conditional use permit is required by the provisions of this chapter or the land use and development regulatory code for one or more of the home businesses, the applicant shall obtain a separate conditional use permit for each home business pursuant to Chapter 20.50 POMC.

(e) The residential character of the building shall be maintained and the business shall be wholly situated indoors. There shall be no exterior display, alteration of the property, expansion of parking, storage or other exterior indication of the existence of the home business, except as may be allowed by the underlying zone. Signs may be allowed in accordance with the city’s sign regulations under Chapter 20.132 POMC.

(f) Home businesses shall not involve the use of more than 40 percent or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less, of the combined gross floor area of the principal residential building, garage, and the living area of any accessory structure.

(g) A home business shall not include the following uses: commercial instruction with four or more students, commercial stable, kennel, restaurant, marijuana (processing, production, and/or retail), medical clinic, vehicle detailing, and minor or major vehicle repair.

(h) The home business shall not infringe upon the right of neighboring residents to enjoy the peaceful occupancy of their homes. No offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odor, heat, glare or unusual or excessive traffic to and from the premises shall be produced or generated by the home business.

(i) There shall be no use of electrical or mechanical equipment which would change the fire rating of the structure or which would create visible or audible interference in radio or television receivers or which would cause fluctuations in line voltage outside the dwelling.

(j) In order to better ensure neighborhood compatibility, if a conditional use permit is required by the provisions of this chapter or the land use and development regulatory code, the applicant may be required to install and maintain landscape screening or similar sight obscuring structures such as fencing.

(2) Persons engaged in legal home businesses on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be considered legal, provided the operation is consistent with all of the above-listed standards. Any home business which was legally established but does not currently conform to all those standards may not expand or enlarge and shall be subject to revocation of their business license upon:

(a) Change of use, sale or transfer of the home business, or relocation of the home business to a new location; or

(b) Written complaint of adjacent or nearby resident which clearly establishes that the home business is interfering with the use and enjoyment of the neighboring premises and is not compatible with the residential environment in which it is located.

(3) Home business licenses and conditional use permits are not transferable. Any changes to the home business use, sale or transfer of the home business, or relocation of the home business to a new location shall be deemed an abandonment of the license and of any conditional use permit. 

(4) The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the following: bed and breakfast establishments, as defined in Chapter 20.12 POMC; daycare facilities, as defined in Chapter 20.12 POMC. 

(5) Any person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter and/or with the provisions of Chapter 5.12 POMC, as applicable, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of POMC 5.12.160 and 5.12.170 now or as hereafter amended. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.60.050 Revocation of home business license. 

(1) In addition to any other penalties provided in POMC Title 5, or as otherwise permitted by law, a home business license may be revoked under any of the following circumstances:

(a) The license or licensee qualifies for revocation or suspension as set forth in POMC 5.12.120; 

(b) The license or licensee fails to comply with any provisions of a conditional use permit; or

(c) The licensee fails to comply with any provision of this chapter.

(2) If the city receives a complaint from an adjacent or nearby resident that alleges that the licensee is failing to comply with the provisions of this chapter and/or the provisions of any applicable conditional use permit, the city staff shall investigate the complaint and shall give the licensee an opportunity to rebut any claims or complaints. 

(3) Upon determination that there is cause for revocation of a home business license by the city, notice shall be sent to the licensee as set forth in POMC 5.12.120(2).

(4) A licensee is entitled to a hearing on revocation of their home business license. A request for a hearing must be received by the city within 15 days of the licensee’s receipt of the city’s notice under subsection (3) of this section. Failure to request a hearing within 15 days shall be deemed a waiver of the licensee’s right to a hearing and shall result in the decision of city staff to revoke the home business license being final.

(5) If a request for hearing is received in accordance with subsection (4) of this section, a hearing on revocation of a home business license shall be handled in the same manner as set forth in POMC 5.12.120(3) through (6). (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

20.64.070    Report of disturbance and unlawful activity.

20.64.080    Visibility of activities – Control of emissions.


20.64.010 Findings, purpose, and intent.

(1) In November 2012, Washington voters passed Initiative 502, which established precedent for the production, processing and retail sale of marijuana for recreational purposes. Pursuant to Chapter 69.50 RCW, the state has adopted rules establishing a state-wide regulatory and licensing program for marijuana uses (Chapter 315-55 WAC). It is therefore desirable for the city to establish local regulations to address such uses.

(2) In April 2015, the Washington State Legislature amended the statutory definitions relating to medical marijuana in RCW 69.51A.010, and also eliminated the regulations applicable to “collective gardens” and adopted provisions allowing medical marijuana “cooperatives” effective July 1, 2016.

(3) The purpose of these regulations is to establish where recreational marijuana producers, processors and retail outlets and medical marijuana cooperatives may locate in the city, and to describe the restrictions upon such uses.

(4) These regulations are intended to ensure that state-licensed marijuana uses are located and developed in a manner that is consistent with the desired character and standards of the city of Port Orchard, minimizes potential incompatibilities and impacts, and protects the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Port Orchard.

(5) No part of this chapter is intended to or shall be deemed to circumvent federal law, or provide permission to any person or entity to violate federal law, including but not limited to the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. Section 800 et seq., the Uniform Controlled Substances Act (Chapter 69.50 RCW), nor to otherwise permit any activity that is prohibited under either Act, or any other local, state or federal law, statute, rule or regulation. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede Washington State law prohibiting the acquisition, possession, manufacture, sale or use of marijuana in any manner not authorized by Chapter 69.50 or 69.51A RCW. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, or that creates a nuisance, as defined herein.

(6) This chapter incorporates certain requirements and procedures set forth in Chapter 69.50 RCW and Chapter 314-55 WAC. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of Chapter 69.50 RCW or Chapter 314-55 WAC, the more restrictive provision shall control. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.64.020 Applicability.

(1) The provisions of this chapter shall apply city-wide. The specific development standards provided herein shall be in addition to the land use and development regulations generally applicable to the proposed use and the relevant zoning district.

(2) The regulations under Chapter 69.50 RCW and Chapter 314-55 WAC, now or as may hereafter be amended, shall apply to all marijuana businesses and medical marijuana cooperatives, as applicable, in addition to the provisions of this chapter.

(3) No person or use that purports to be a marijuana producer, processor, or retailer, or a medical marijuana collective garden, as defined and regulated herein and in Chapters 69.50 and 69.51A RCW and Chapter 314-55 WAC, that was engaged in that activity prior to the enactment of this chapter shall be deemed to have been a legally established use or entitled to claim legal nonconforming status.

(4) The city may, prior to issuance of any license or permit, perform an inspection of the proposed premises to determine compliance with any applicable requirements of this chapter and all other applicable city ordinances and regulations. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.64.030 Location criteria.

(e) Public park;

(f) Public transit center;

(2) The methodology for measuring the buffers described above shall be as provided in WAC 314-55-050.

If new or upgraded water or sewer connections are required, water and/or sewer connection fees shall be required in accordance with POMC Title 13.

(c) Accessory Dwelling Unit Agreement. The owner of any property containing an ADU shall record with the Kitsap County auditor an accessory dwelling unit agreement and notice to title for the ADU. Such agreement and notice shall be approved by the planning director, on a form approved by the city council, and shall include as a minimum: (i) the legal description of the property which has been permitted for the ADU; (ii) affirmation that the owner shall occupy either the main building or the ADU (unless the ADU is within a commercial or industrial development), and that the property owner agrees to all requirements provided in this chapter; and (iii) the conditions necessary to apply the restrictions and limitations contained in this section.

The property owner shall submit proof that the agreement and notice to title have been recorded prior to issuance of an ADU permit. The ADU agreement and notice to title shall run with the land as long as the ADU is maintained on the property. The property owner may, at any time, apply to the planning director for a termination of the ADU agreement. Such termination shall be granted upon proof that the ADU no longer exists on the property and that a notice to title has been recorded which states that the ADU has been removed.

(d) Permit. Upon receipt of a complete application, application fees, proof of recorded accessory dwelling unit agreement, and approval of any necessary building or other permits, an ADU permit shall be issued. (Ord. 021-20 § 2; Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.68.080 Inspection.

The city shall inspect the property to confirm that minimum and maximum size limits, required parking and design standards, and all applicable building, health, safety, energy, and electrical code standards are met. (Ord. 021-20 § 2; Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.68.090 Violations.

A violation of this chapter regarding provision of ownership shall be governed by POMC 20.68.100(5), and a violation of provision of legalization of nonconforming ADUs shall be governed by POMC 20.68.100(9). Violations of any other city permit or code requirements shall be governed by Chapter 20.02 POMC. (Ord. 021-20 § 2; Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.68.100 General requirements.

ADUs shall be subject to the following requirements, which shall not be subject to a variance:

(1) ADU permits may only be issued for a legal lot of record zoned for single-family use containing not more than one single-family dwelling.

(2) Number of ADUs per Lot. No more than one ADU, whether an accessory apartment (attached dwelling) or a backyard cottage dwelling, shall be permitted on one lot.

(3) Occupancy. The maximum number of occupants in any ADU shall be four persons. Maximum occupancy may be further limited by Section 1004 (Occupant Load) of the International Building Code.

(4) Composition. The ADU shall include facilities for cooking, living, sanitation, and sleeping.

(5) Ownership and Occupancy. The property owner must maintain his or her occupancy in the main residence or the ADU. For the purposes of this chapter, “occupancy” means that the property owner, as reflected in title records, makes his or her legal residence at the site, as evidenced by property tax, voter registration, vehicle registration, or similar means, and actually resides at the site more than six months out of any given year, and at no time rents both units. Owners shall record a notice on title, as approved by the city, which attests to their occupancy and attests that at no time shall they rent both units. Falsely attesting owner-residency shall be a gross misdemeanor subject to a fine not to exceed $5,000, including all statutory costs, assessments, and fees. In addition, ADUs shall not be subdivided or otherwise segregated in ownership from the main building. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as prohibiting a property owner from renting out a room or rooms in their legal residence of occupancy (main residence or ADU) to another resident or residents, or from collecting rent from a roommate, as long as the property owner continues to maintain occupancy according to the terms of this subsection.

(6) Parking. No off-street parking is required for the ADU; provided, that the minimum required off-street parking per Chapter 20.124 POMC for the primary use (single-family residence, commercial or industrial development) is met on the lot or if on-street parking is provided on both sides of the street(s) abutting the lot. One parking stall shall be provided per ADU if either of the preceding conditions is not satisfied. If additional ADU parking is provided, parking for a commercial or industrial ADU shall be located in the rear portion of the lot and shall not be accessed from the front if suitable access to the rear is available, such as an abutting right-of-way that is or can practicably be developed. Driveways shall comply with the vehicular access and driveway standards in the city’s development guidelines.

(7) Home Businesses and Occupations. Home businesses and occupations shall be allowed, subject to existing regulations. However, if both the main residence and the ADU contain home businesses, only one of the two is permitted to receive customers on the premises.

(8) Short-Term Rental. The use of an ADU as a short-term rental shall be allowed, subject to compliance with the vacation rental and bed and breakfast regulations in POMC 20.39.345.

(9) Legalization of Nonconforming ADUs. Existing ADUs that are made nonconforming by this chapter, or ADUs legally existing prior to the enactment of these requirements, may be maintained as a legal nonconforming use in accordance with Chapter 20.54 POMC. (Ord. 021-20 § 2; Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).

An accessory ADU shall be permitted within a detached residential dwelling, or within a commercial or industrial building.

(6) Setbacks and Lot Coverage. For a detached ADU, refer to POMC 20.32.030, Backyard cottage. For an attached ADU that is accessory to a commercial or industrial use, refer to the appropriate building type in Chapter 20.32 POMC. The calculation of lot coverage shall include all buildings on the lot or site, including the ADU, the primary single-family dwelling (for residential properties), and accessory buildings. Existing and future accessory buildings, including an ADU, must meet required setbacks for the relevant zone and building type.

(7) Design – Attached ADUs. An attached ADU shall be designed to maintain the architectural design, style, appearance, and character of the main building as a single-family residence. If an attached ADU extends beyond the current footprint or existing height of the main building, such an addition must be consistent with the existing facade, roof pitch, siding, and windows. Any exterior modification or addition to a single-family residence shall comply with the design standards in Chapter 20.139 POMC.

A detached ADU shall be designed to complement the architectural design, style, appearance, and character of the main building by utilizing complementary colors and finish materials, window styles, and roof design to the main building. The entrance door to a detached ADU shall not face the same property line as the entrance door to the main building except when the entrance door to the ADU is located behind the rear wall of the main building. The detached ADU shall also be subject to the requirements of Chapter 20.139 POMC, Residential Design Standards.

(10) Walkways. For ADUs with a separate exterior entrance, a pedestrian walkway shall be provided between the ADU and the nearest sidewalk, or where no sidewalk exists, the nearest street right-of-way. The walkway shall be composed of materials that are distinct from any adjacent vehicle driving or parking surfaces. The walkway may function as a shared pedestrian/vehicle space; provided, that it is constructed of distinct materials, is located along an exterior edge of a driving surface, and vehicles are not permitted to park on the walkway so that pedestrian use is hindered or prevented.

20.82.040 Violations, enforcement, and penalties.

(1) General. It is a violation of this subtitle for a person to divide, segregate, sell, or transfer, or offer to sell or transfer, real property in violation of this subtitle. It is a violation of this subtitle to do any other thing with respect to a lot, tract, parcel, or property in the city that violates this subtitle or violates a plat or short plat restriction imposed by the city.

(2) Enforcement. It is unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this subtitle or of any notice or lawful order issued hereunder.

(v) Result in a lot that previously met sewer/water district standards for sewer/water service no longer meeting district standards;

(vi) Be inconsistent with any restrictions or conditions of approval for a recorded plat or short plat;

(vii) Involve lots that do not have a common boundary;

(viii) Circumvent the subdivision or short subdivision procedures set forth in this subtitle;

(ix) Create an unbuildable lot; or

(x) Increase the likelihood of future applications for critical area buffer reductions or variances due to the creation of lots, parcels or tracts that are undevelopable or unusable without a buffer reduction. 

(3) The elimination of lines between two or more lots for the purpose of creating a single lot that meets requirements as a building site in all cases shall be considered a minor adjustment of boundary lines and shall not be subject to the subdivision and short subdivision provisions of this subtitle.

(4) Recognized lots in an approved site plan for a conditional use permit, special use permit, or binding site plan shall be considered a single site and no lot lines on the site may be altered by a boundary line adjustment to transfer density or separate lots to another property not included in the original site plan of the subject development without additional conditional use permit, special use permit, or binding site plan review and approval. 

(5) Lots that have been subject to a boundary line adjustment process that resulted in the qualification of an additional building site shall not be permitted to utilize the boundary line adjustment process again for five years to create an additional building site. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.84.050 Final approval and recording. 

(1) Prior to final approval, documentation authorizing the transfer of property ownership shall be placed on the original boundary line map along with the legal descriptions of those portions of land being transferred when lots are under separate ownership.

20.94.010 Purpose.

This chapter provides for an optional method for the division of land for the lease or sale of commercial or industrial property, condominiums, and mobile/manufactured home parks through the use of a binding site plan as provided for in Chapter 58.17 RCW. On sites that are fully developed, the binding site plan merely creates or alters interior lot lines. In all cases the binding site plan ensures, through written agreements among all lot owners, that the collective lots continue to function as one site concerning but not limited to: lot access; interior circulation; open space; landscaping and drainage; facility maintenance; and coordinated parking.

This method may be employed as an alternative to the subdivision and short subdivision procedures in this subtitle, only when consistent with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.94.020 Scope.

(1) This chapter shall govern a subdivision of land through the optional binding site process provided for in RCW 58.17.035, or its successor. If approved under this chapter, a division of land authorized by a binding site plan is exempt from the short and long subdivision regulations and processes.

(2) Any person seeking the use of a binding site plan to divide the person’s property for the purpose of sale, lease, or transfer of ownership of commercially or industrially zoned property is required to apply for, complete, and have approved a binding site plan prior to any property division, as provided in Chapter 58.17, 64.32, or 64.34 RCW and as required by this chapter.

(3) The site that is subject to the binding site plan shall consist of one or more contiguous, legally-created lots.

(4) A binding site plan for a condominium shall be based on a building permit, an as-built site plan for developed sites, a master land use permit issued for the entire site, or an approved site plan showing the anticipated development plan for the entire site, notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 20.88 POMC.

(5) The site that is subject to the binding site plan may be reviewed independently for fully developed sites, or concurrently with a development permit application for undeveloped land.

(6) The binding site plan process merely creates or alters lot lines and does not authorize substantial improvements or changes to the property or the uses thereon. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.94.030 Application requirements.

The following materials shall be submitted to the city, pursuant to any additional application rules, policies, or procedures issued by the department, in order to constitute a complete application for a binding site plan:

The applicant shall submit five copies of the binding site plan map for review. The site plan shall have dimensions of 18 inches by 24 inches and must be prepared by a registered land surveyor licensed in the state of Washington. In addition to requirements of Chapter 64.34 RCW, the binding site plan map must include the following:

The notice shall establish the date of the public hearing. (Ord. 029-18 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.96.070 Criteria for approval.

(1) Vacation Criteria. The plat vacation may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied after a written determination, with findings and conclusions, is made whether the public use and interest will be served by the vacation.

(2) Dedications and Easements. If any portion of the land contained in the subdivision was dedicated to the public for public use and benefit, such land, if not already deeded to the city, shall be deeded to the city as a condition of approval, unless the city shall make findings that the public use would not be served in retaining title to those lands. Easements established by a dedication are property rights that cannot be extinguished or altered without the approval of the easement owner or owners, unless the plat or other document creating the dedicated easement provides for an alternative method or methods to extinguish or alter the easement.

(3) Street Vacations. When the vacation application is specifically for vacation of a city street, the city’s street vacation procedures (and/or the procedures in Chapter 35.79 RCW) shall be utilized. When the procedure is for the vacation of a plat together with the streets, the vacation procedure in this chapter shall be used, but vacations of streets may not be made that are prohibited under RCW 35.79.035 or the city’s street vacation ordinance.

(4) Title to Vacated Property. Title to the vacated property shall vest with the rightful owner as shown on the county records. If the vacated land is land that was dedicated to the public, for public use other than a road or street, and the legislative authority has found that retaining title to the land is not in the public interest, title thereto shall vest with the person(s) owning the property on each side thereof, as determined by the legislative authority. When the road or street that is to be vacated is contained wholly within the subdivision and is part of the boundary of the subdivision, title to the vacated road or street shall vest with the owner(s) of property contained within the vacated subdivision.

(5) Alteration Criteria. The alteration may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied after a written determination, with findings and conclusions, is made whether the public use and interest will be served by the alteration. If any land within the alteration area is part of an assessment district, any outstanding assessments shall be equitably divided and levied against the remaining lots, parcels or tracts, or be levied equitably on the lots resulting from the alteration. If any land within the alteration contains a dedication to the general use of persons residing within the subdivision, such land may be altered and divided equitably between the adjacent properties. (Ord. 029-18 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.96.080 Time limitation for final decision. 

A vacation or alteration application shall be approved, approved with conditions or denied within 120 days after the application has been determined to be complete pursuant to POMC 20.24.050, unless the applicant consents in writing to an extension of such time period. (Ord. 029-18 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.96.090 Recording. 

After approval of the alteration or vacation, the city shall order the applicant to produce a revised drawing of the approved alteration or vacation of the short plat or final plat. The council shall authorize the mayor to sign the approved short plat or final plat, and then the city shall file it with the county auditor at the applicant’s cost, to become the lawful plat of the property (or to vacate the previously approved plat). (Ord. 029-18 § 3; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Sections:

20.98.010    Purpose.

20.98.020    Completion of public facilities and improvements.

20.98.030    Bonds.

20.98.040    Temporary improvements.

20.98.050    Cost of improvements.

20.98.060    Inspection and acceptance of improvements.


20.98.010 Purpose. 

The purpose of this chapter is:

(1) To require the subdivider’s submission of construction plans for development of the subdivision to the city for review and approval of specific construction details for all public facilities; 

(2) To ensure that the public facilities required as part of approvals granted under this subtitle are built according to city standards;

(3) To address bonds between the city and property owners/subdividers, allowing a limited deferral for the construction of public facilities associated with the approval; and

(4) To ensure that the required public facilities and public utilities are ready and available for use when needed by the users of the subdivision. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.98.020 Completion of public facilities and improvements. 

No short plat can be recorded or a final plat of a subdivision or final binding site plan approved, until all of the public facilities and other improvements as specified in the short plat, preliminary plat, or preliminary binding site plan are constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the responsible departments. As an alternative to such construction, the applicant may post a bond, or execute a development agreement, with appropriate security in order to record the short plat or obtain approval of the final plat or binding site plan. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.98.030 Bonds. 

(1) Performance Bond May Be Posted in Lieu of Construction. The city, in its sole discretion, may waive the requirement that the public facilities or other improvements and dedications required under this chapter be completed/satisfied prior to the recording of the short plat or approval of the final plat or final binding site plan, as long as the applicant posts a bond in accordance with this section. The city’s decision to allow the applicant to post a bond allows the applicant to apply for building permits for lots in the plat or binding site plan before the dedications have been made or the improvements constructed. 

(2) When Performance Bond Is Appropriate. The city may consider a number of factors in the determination whether to allow a bond to be posted by an applicant, including, but not limited to:

(a) The date of the applicant’s request to post a bond in light of the deadline for recording of the short plat, or the deadline for submission of final plat or final binding site plan applications, and the applicant’s progress to date toward the completion of the public facilities; 

(b) The consequences that could result from the applicant’s construction of the homes or other development contemplated by the proposed approval, before the necessary public facilities are completed/installed; and 

(c) Any other issues that may affect the public health and safety. 

(3) Acceptable Bonds. No bond shall be accepted by the city unless it is submitted on the form approved in advance by the city attorney and from a bonding company licensed to do business in the state of Washington. The city engineer shall determine the amount of the bond, which shall be no less than 150 percent of the estimated cost of the public facilities or improvements. The city engineer shall make a recommendation as to the length of the bond, which shall be no longer than two years after the final approval. 

(4) Warranty Bond. Once the public facilities have been constructed, the dedications made and city has inspected and approved the public facilities, the applicant shall provide the city with a warranty bond meeting all the requirements of this section to ensure the successful operation of the public facilities, for a period of two years after such inspection and approval. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.98.040 Temporary improvements. 

The applicant shall pay for and build all temporary improvements required by any approval, and shall maintain those improvements as set forth in the approval. Prior to the construction of any temporary improvement, the applicant shall provide a bond with a cash escrow or cash set aside in an amount established by the city engineer to ensure that the temporary facilities/improvements will be properly constructed, maintained, and timely removed. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.98.050 Cost of improvements. 

All required public facilities and improvements shall be constructed by the applicant/property owner, at their sole expense, without reimbursement by the city, unless otherwise specified in the project permit approval or development agreement with the city. To the extent allowed by law, the city may form or cause to be formed a local improvement district or latecomers’ agreement for the construction and financing of the required public facilities, excluding on-site improvements on individual lots. If such district is formed or latecomer agreement signed, the applicant/property owner shall not be released from its obligation (as set forth in the bonds, cash escrow, or cash set aside) to construct the public facilities until complete or the city is satisfied that a subsequent guarantee will cover performance. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.98.060 Inspection and acceptance of improvements. 

(1) General Procedure. The subdivider/property owner shall pay an inspection fee based on the estimated cost of the inspection, which fees shall be due and payable upon inspection. No building permits or certificates of occupancy shall issue until the fees are paid. If the city engineer finds that one or more of the required public facilities or other improvements have not been satisfactorily constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications or other applicable standards or regulations, the subdivider/property owner shall be responsible for any corrections and completion of the improvements. 

(2) Release of Security. The city will not accept dedication of required public facilities or improvements, nor release nor reduce the amount of any security posted by the subdivider, until the city engineer has submitted a certificate stating: 

(a) That all required public facilities or other improvements have been satisfactorily completed; and

(b) The subdivider’s engineer or surveyor has certified to the city engineer, through the submission of a detailed “as built” survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials and other information required by the city’s public works standards, that the layout of the line and grade of all transportation facilities, public facilities or other improvements is in accordance with the approved construction plans for the subdivision or binding site plan. 

(3) City’s Acceptance and Dedications. Upon the recommendation for approval of the city engineer, the city council shall thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in an ordinance or resolution adopted for this purpose; the approval of a final plat, absent such resolution or ordinance, shall not be deemed to constitute or imply acceptance by the city of any street, easement, park, or other improvement on the plat.

(4) Maintenance of Improvements. The subdivider/property owner shall be required to maintain all required public facilities until the dedication of same is formally accepted by the city. Following the acceptance of the public facilities, the subdivider shall provide a warranty bond or other security to the city as required by this chapter.

(5) Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy. When a bond has been accepted by the city for the construction of public facilities or other improvements in a short plat, final plat, or final binding site plan, the city shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for any building in the development prior to the completion of the required public facilities or improvements and the acceptance of the dedication of those facilities or improvements by the city. The city engineer may authorize the issuance of up to 50 percent of the building permits for the lots in the subdivision if: 

(a) The applicant is not in default of the subdivision improvement agreement; and

(b) The applicant has constructed and the city has inspected/accepted the public facilities or other improvements necessary to serve the lots for which such building permit applications have been submitted. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

20.100.020 General requirements.

(1) Design in Accordance with City Standards. All subdivisions, short plats, and binding site plans shall be designed in accordance with all city standards including but not limited to the adopted city of Port Orchard Public Works Engineering Standards and Specifications (PWESS) and the Port Orchard comprehensive plan.

(2) Approach Roads and Access. All subdivisions, short plats, and binding site plans with a single point of access must have no roadway that exceeds 300 feet or 60 dwelling units from the access point or an average daily traffic (ADT) of greater than 1,200. All other subdivisions, short plats, and binding site plans must have at least two points of vehicular access and must be connected with improved roadways to the city’s improved thoroughfare and street system by two or more approach roads of the dimensions and standards hereinafter set forth. An access road that is divided with 20 feet in each direction to the intersection of two streets shall be considered two means of access.

(a) Requirements for dedication of right-of-way and improvement of approach roads, signalization, median breaks, additional lanes and other traffic mitigation or safety improvements may be increased depending upon the size or density of the proposed development, or if the need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis.

(b) An exception to standards under this subsection may be granted for a subdivision, short plat, or binding site plan may be allowed by the decision-making authority provided a second emergency access that is controlled in a manner acceptable to the fire authority shall be provided.

(c) Adequate lighting of access points shall be coordinated and provided by the subdivider.

(3) Roadway Network Connectivity.

(a) All proposed developments must have a connectivity index of 1.4 or greater. The connectivity index shall be calculated by dividing the total number of links (streets including stub-out streets that connect nodes) by the total number of nodes (intersections, cul-de-sac, no-outlets, dead-ends).


[IMAGE]


(b) The decision-making authority may grant exceptions to these requirements only upon a finding that the development is constrained by topographic features, existing development or other impassable features.

(c) Street Right-of-Way Dedication. Street right-of-way dedications may be required as a condition of subdivision, short plat, or binding site plan.

(d) Street Construction. All streets and thoroughfares providing access to a proposed subdivision, short plat, or binding site plan shall be constructed and paved to city standards and within rights-of-way in accordance with the adopted PWESS, city’s transportation plan, and other adopted city standards.

(e) Intersection Improvements and Traffic Control Devices. Intersection improvements may be required to ensure public safety as a condition of subdivision, short plat, or binding site plan and shall be designed and improved in accordance with the city’s transportation plan, adopted PWESS and/or nationally recognized standards subject to city review and acceptance. Intersection improvements and/or traffic control devices shall be required only as a result of the findings of a traffic impact analysis reviewed and accepted by the city.

(f) Private Streets. See POMC 20.100.120, Private streets.

(g) Access Management on City Streets. Subdivisions, short plats, and binding site plans shall meet the access management standards found in the adopted PWESS.

(h) Access Management on State Highways. Subdivisions, short plats, and binding site plans shall meet WSDOT access management standards. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.030 Lot layout.

Lots to be created within a proposed subdivision, short plat, or binding site plan should comply with the following requirements:

(1) Lot lines should be at right angles to street lines or radial to curvilinear streets unless a variation will result in a better street or lot plan; and

(2) Corner lots should be graded to provide sufficient sight clearance at intersections. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.040 Street standards.

(1) Arrangement of Streets and Conformance to the City of Port Orchard Comprehensive Plan Transportation Element. Except as provided in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the city’s adopted transportation element shall be used to determine the minimum type of roadway, the general location of the roadway, and the areas that the roadway is intended to connect as part of the platting process. For streets that are not identified in the city’s transportation element, such as local residential streets, the arrangement of such streets within a subdivision shall:

(a) Conform to any plan for the neighborhood or subarea plan approved or adopted by the city to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformity to existing streets impractical;

(b) Provide for future access, by stubbing streets for future extension, to adjacent vacant or undeveloped areas which will likely not have incompatible land uses; and

(c) Not conflict in any way with existing or proposed driveway openings (including those on the other side of an existing or planned median-divided arterial, in which case new streets shall align with such driveway openings such that median openings can be shared).

(2) Projections and Related Requirements. Where adjoining unsubdivided areas exist, the subdivision street arrangement shall make provision for projection of streets into such areas. Dead-end streets shall otherwise be prohibited, except where projections into unsubdivided land are necessary or where turnarounds are provided in accordance with POMC 20.100.080. Private streets shall not be allowed to project beyond the subdivision boundary, and therefore shall not be allowed to dead-end at the subdivision boundary.

(3) Transitions of Right-of-Way Width. Wherever the right-of-way width of a residential, local, collector or arterial street must transition to a greater or lesser width, the transition shall not occur within an intersection but within the street right-of-way so that the right-of-way shall be the same on both sides of the street intersection.

(4) Configuration Shall Reduce Minimal Offsets. Intersecting streets onto an existing or future divided roadway must be configured in accordance with POMC 20.100.100, Street offsets, such that the centerline offset will accommodate the appropriate median opening and left-turn lanes (with required transition and stacking distances) on each divided roadway, and shall be aligned with any existing or proposed streets or driveways on the opposite side of the divided roadway (in order to share the median opening). Median openings and offsets should be analyzed in the traffic impact analysis, and a determination made if developments sharing a median opening may cause additional traffic conflicts, where an exception to sharing a median opening may be made.

(5) Extensions of Existing Streets. New streets which extend existing streets shall bear the names of the existing streets and shall be dedicated at equal or greater right-of-way widths than the existing streets for an appropriate transition length, if applicable, unless a lesser street is justified by a TIA.

(6) Street Grades and Horizontal Curves. Minimum and maximum street grades and horizontal curves shall conform to standards set forth in the Engineering Standards and Specifications and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), or as otherwise approved by the city engineer.

(7) Street Signs. Street signs shall be installed by the developer at all intersections within and abutting the subdivision. These signs shall be of a type approved by the city, and shall be installed according to city standards and in conformance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

(8) Streetlights. Streetlights shall be installed in accordance with the requirements set forth in the adopted PWESS.

(9) Pedestrian Connectivity. Pedestrian connectivity and access shall be provided between subdivisions, schools (where access is allowed by the school district), cul-de-sacs (i.e., bulb-to-bulb access), adjacent areas available for future development, and park and open space areas.

(10) Reserve Strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is required by the city and approved by the approving authority. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.050 Intersections, half-streets.

(1) Intersections. Street intersections shall be situated at an angle of 90 degrees, plus or minus 15 degrees, except where the intersection utilizes knuckles, turning heels or eyebrows in accordance with the adopted PWESS. Such intersections shall maintain proper intersection visibility as determined by the latest edition of AASHTO’s “A policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.” The major access driveway to large multifamily, commercial and industrial developments shall also meet the requirements of this chapter.

(2) Half-Streets. Construction of half-streets shall be prohibited, except when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision, short plat, or binding site plan in conforming with the other requirements of this code and the transportation element, and where the decision-making authority makes a determination at the time of approval that there is no immediate benefit to be gained by constructing the full street section since no access from the street will be needed by the project in question. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.060 Street length.

(1) Length of a Block or Street Segment. The maximum length of any block or street segment (including a looped street) shall be 600 feet along arterial streets. Block faces shall not exceed 800 feet along other streets and the full perimeter of a block shall not exceed 2,400 feet except where topographic or critical areas features on parcels of one-half acre or larger would justify an exception from this requirement. Cul-de-sac streets shall adhere to Table 20.100.070(1) or other requirements herein. Measurements shall be measured along the centerline of the street from the centerline or center point of one intersection to the centerline or center point of the next intersection. For the purposes of measurement, either a full four-way intersection or a “T” three-way intersection shall be considered an intersection.

(2) The length of a block or street segment may exceed the maximum length stated in subsection (1) of this section under the following conditions:

(a) Blocks containing retention or detention ponds;

(b) Blocks containing parks; and

(c) Development where the proposed development abuts the rear of an existing development and no rights-of-way have been provided.

(3) Maximum Length of a Cul-De-Sac Street.

(a) No cul-de-sac served by one access point in any single-family, multiple-family, industrial, or commercial subdivision shall exceed 450 feet in length or the length as shown in Table 20.100.070(1), whichever is less.

(b) No cul-de-sac in any single-family subdivision district shall be designed to serve more than 25 single-family dwelling units, unless an exception is granted by the hearing examiner to the maximum length, in which case the maximum number of dwelling units shall be increased in the same percentage as the maximum length has been increased.

(c) For purposes of this subsection, cul-de-sac length shall be measured along the centerline of the cul-de-sac from a point beginning at the intersection of the cul-de-sac street with the centerline of the street from which it extends to the center of the turnaround at the end of such cul-de-sac. (Also see POMC 20.100.070 for cul-de-sac requirements.) For the purposes of measurement, either a full four-way intersection or a “T” three-way intersection shall be considered an intersection.

(d) An exception to the maximum cul-de-sac lengths may be granted by the decision-making authority to develop a parcel:

(i) With significant topographic constraints such as those documented in a geological report or where the resulting roadway would exceed a 12 percent grade;

(ii) With critical areas requiring protection on or adjacent to the parcel;

(iii) That is effectively landlocked with no other alternative than a cul-de-sac exceeding 450 feet;

(iv) Is in a proposed subdivision that has such a unique configuration that the only way to serve the area in question is with a cul-de-sac exceeding 450 feet. Such exception shall not be granted if the length of the cul-de-sac can be reduced by connection to an adjacent and/or parallel street. The desire to gain additional lots from the cul-de-sac exception by itself is not reason enough to grant such exception to the maximum length;

(v) Additional modifications may be required by the decision-making authority upon recommendation by the fire authority including intermediate turnarounds (eyebrows) to accommodate emergency vehicles being provided at a maximum distance of 300 feet;

(vi) Building construction within the area of the cul-de-sac beyond the 450 feet distance shall be fire sprinklered and a note shall be added to the recording plat and the subdivision improvement plans indicating that buildings are required to be sprinklered within the subdivision, and which lot numbers have such requirement.

(4) Cross-Reference. Also see POMC 20.100.070 for cul-de-sac requirements. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.070 Cul-de-sac streets.

Except where projecting into adjacent unsubdivided areas, any street having only one vehicular access to another street shall be terminated by a permanent turnaround. Standards for both the turnaround and its street approach are set forth within this section. Exceptions to these standards shall be discouraged due to firefighting and solid waste collection requirements. Any turnaround, either temporary or permanent, that does not meet these requirements shall be permanently signed for no parking or marked as a fire lane in accordance with the adopted PWESS.

(1) That portion of any street extending from an intersection to a turnaround shall be improved and rights-of-way platted with the minimal dimensions provided in Table 20.100.070(1) below.

(Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.080 Dead-end streets.

Except when recommended by the department of community development, no public dead-end streets will be approved unless they are provided to connect with existing streets (including stubbed-out streets) or future platted streets on adjacent land.

(1) In the case of dead-end streets which will eventually be extended into the adjacent property, no more than one lot (per side) can front onto the dead-end street stub unless a temporary turnaround bulb (with the appropriate temporary street easement) is provided at the end.

(2) A temporary dead-end street shall not exceed the maximum allowed length of a normal cul-de-sac, and the temporary turnaround bulb must be constructed like a cul-de-sac, as provided in POMC 20.100.070, Cul-de-sac streets.

(3) A note shall be placed on the final plat, short plat, or binding site plan clearly labeling any temporary dead-end streets (if any) that will at some point be extended into the adjacent property. Any required temporary turnaround easements shall be shown on the final plat along with their appropriate recording information, if they are off site or established by separate instrument. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.090 Street width and design.

(1) Pavement Widths and Rights-of-Way. Pavement widths and design and rights-of-way shall be as designated in the adopted PWESS; provided, that for local access streets, the subdivision also meets the applicable block length requirements of POMC 20.100.060 and connectivity index in POMC 20.100.020.

(2) Design. Streets shall be designed according to the following requirements:

(a) Arterial. Streets shall be designed to accommodate cross-city traffic movement, distributing traffic to and from collector streets;

(b) Collector. Streets shall be designed to collect traffic from local streets and connect with arterial streets and freeways;

(c) Residential Collector. Generally, the term “subcollector” shall refer to streets designed to accommodate traffic movement from local streets to higher classifications of streets as well as provide direct access to activity on individual lots. Specifically, a subcollector may be defined as any street or portion thereof providing direct access to property within commercial or industrial districts as designated on the official zoning map of the city of Port Orchard, any street or portion thereof providing the shortest direct route to a collector street for 25 dwelling units or more, or any street segment extending without offset from a collector street and connecting two or more collector streets. Where subcollector streets are terminated by a permanent turnaround, standards for street width and paving shall be as described in the engineering standards and specifications;

(d) Local. Streets shall be designed to provide direct access to residential activity, and in such a way as to encourage connectivity of the roadway network, but discourage cut-through traffic. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.100 Street offsets.

Intersection Offsets. Where parallel streets intersect another street, the centerline of those streets shall be offset a minimum of 120 feet, unless a stricter standard is adopted in a subarea or corridor plan. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.110 Curbs and gutters.

Curbs and gutters shall be installed according to the provisions of this chapter and to the adopted PWESS. Combination curb and gutter improvements shall be provided to mark the edge of pavement and carry surface water, as set forth below:

(1) Beside Arterial and Collector Streets. The subdivider shall install curbs on both sides of all arterial and collector streets within the subdivision, and on one side of all such streets along the subdivision frontage.

(2) Beside Local Streets. The subdivider shall install curbs on both sides of all local streets within the subdivision and at subdivision boundaries, except for existing boundary streets, in which case curb and gutter installation shall be required on the subdivision’s frontage only.

(3) At Street Intersections. The minimum curvature of curbs at street intersections shall be as prescribed in the adopted PWESS and shall maintain proper stopping sight distance as determined by the latest edition of AASHTO’s “A policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.” (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.120 Private streets.

(1) Permitted Only as Local Street. Private streets shall require approval as an exception at the time of preliminary plat approval by the hearing examiner in accordance with this title. No streets or thoroughfares shown in the adopted city of Port Orchard comprehensive plan may be a nonpublic street. Construction and development of private streets shall meet the standards for right-of-way width and improvement as set forth in this chapter as applied to public streets.

(2) Classification. At the time a private street is proposed, it shall be classified as either a local access or subcollector street, as described herein, and made to conform in all respects with right-of-way paving, curb and gutter, construction, and design requirements as applicable to a public street.

(3) Subdivision Boundary Streets. New subdivision boundary streets (streets proposed or constructed along a subdivision perimeter boundary) shall not be private.

(4) Private Streets, General. In order to be considered for an exception to allow the construction of private streets, the developer shall meet the requirements set out in this section.

(a) Construction. All private streets shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to meet city standards. The construction and improvement plans shall be reviewed by the city in the same manner as construction and improvement plans for public infrastructure. The city shall not participate in any portion of the cost of constructing a private street.

(b) Inspection During Construction. All private streets shall be subject to inspections by city staff in the same manner, at the same intervals, as public streets, including the payment of applicable inspection fees. A construction schedule shall be submitted with the construction and improvement plans in order to assist in scheduling the inspections. Failure to pass an inspection and meet city construction standards shall require reinspection, and reconstruction, as necessary. No certificates of occupancy shall be released for structures along a private street until all inspections shall have been completed satisfactorily.

(c) Traffic Control Devices. All private traffic control devices and regulatory signs shall conform to the “Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices,” as amended, and to city standards.

(d) Restricted Access. The subdivision homeowners association shall clearly mark entrances to all private streets with a sign, in accordance with the adopted PWESS, placed in a prominent and visible location, indicating that the streets within the subdivision are private, and not maintained nor regularly patrolled by the city. All restricted access entrances shall be manned 24 hours every day, or they shall provide a reliable, alternative means of ensuring access into the subdivision by the city, by emergency service providers, and by other utility or public service providers, such as postal carriers and utility companies, with appropriate identification. The method used to ensure city and emergency access into the subdivision shall be approved by South Kitsap Fire and Rescue and by any other applicable emergency service providers during the final platting process. Gates on private streets shall provide a traffic queue analysis and provide adequate on-street storage in advance of the gate. If the homeowners association fails to maintain reliable access as required by city codes, the city may enter the private street subdivision and remove any gate or device that is a barrier to access, and bill the expense to the association. If the bill is not paid, the city may file a lien for the expense against any property owned by the association.

(e) Waiver of Services. Certain city services may not be provided for private street subdivisions, including street maintenance, routine law enforcement patrols, enforcement of traffic and parking regulations, preparation of accident reports, and payment of costs for street lighting. A note as to waiver of services may be required on the face of the plat.

(f) Street Lighting. Street lighting as required by this title shall be entirely at the expense of the developer and subsequent property owners. Decorative poles or alternative spacing may be approved by the city engineer, who shall make such recommendation based on the lighting type, the lumens necessary to effectuate safe traffic and pedestrian travel, and a finding that the proposed lighting plan provides as well or better for the health, safety and welfare of the future residents of the private street subdivisions.

(g) Maintenance. The developer shall provide for the establishment of a homeowners or property owners association, in covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CCRs), to assume the obligation of perpetual maintenance of private streets and other improvements held privately, including a mandatory assessment for such private streets and improvements to be placed on all property owners within the subdivision, allowance for city staff to inspect the streets to assure they are being maintained to city standards, hold harmless provisions as required in subsection (5) of this section, and providing for notice to the city attorney and city manager of any amendments to these relevant sections. The city shall be a necessary party for the amendment of any portions of the CCRs dealing with these requirements. The proposed CCRs shall be submitted for review by the city attorney at the time of filing the preliminary plat. The city attorney shall review the CCRs to ensure that the requirements of this section are met, and shall submit recommended changes to the developer, who shall incorporate such changes. Absence of city attorney approval of the CCRs shall require the denial of the exception for private streets.

(h) Petition to Convert to Public Streets. A property owners association may petition the city to accept private streets and any associated property as public streets and right-of-way upon written notice to all association members, and the favorable vote of a majority of the membership, or as required in the CCRs. A dedication instrument shall also be submitted, and shall be reviewed and the final form approved by the city attorney prior to submission of this request to city council.

The city shall not be required to accept any private streets for public dedication and maintenance. The staff shall review the request and make a recommendation to city council. City council shall make their decision based on the public health, safety and welfare considerations of the streets. As a condition of accepting the dedication and maintenance of private streets, the city may impose a requirement for repairs and improvements at private expense prior to acceptance, enter into an agreement for an assessment or pro-rata sharing of costs for repairs or improvements prior to acceptance, or other legal or equitable options to ensure that the streets being accepted are not a liability to the city. The city shall be the sole judge of the nature and extent of repairs or improvements needed. The city may also require, at the sole expense of the association’s or property owner’s expense, the removal of any guard houses, access control devices, landscaping or other amenities located within the streets or common areas prior to city acceptance.

(5) Hold Harmless. The property owners association, as owner of the private streets and appurtenances, shall release, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, any other governmental entity, and any public utility entity for damages to the private streets that may be occasioned by the reasonable use of the private streets by same, and for damages and injury (including death) arising from the condition of the private streets, out of any use of access gates or cross arms, or out of any use of the subdivision by the city or governmental or utility entity. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.100.130 On-site recreation space for subdivisions.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that adequate, usable, passive and active recreational opportunities are provided for residents of new subdivisions.

(2) Applicability. On-site recreation space shall be provided for new residential subdivisions consisting of 10 or more new dwellings. The establishment of backyard cottages or accessory dwelling units shall not trigger requirements for additional on-site recreation facilities when those building types are constructed within an existing subdivision.

(3) On-Site Open Space Quantity Requirements.

(a) On-site recreation space shall be provided in accordance with Table 20.100.130(3).

Table 20.100.130(3) 

	Number of Dwelling Units in Subdivision	Amount of On-Site Recreation Space Required per Each Dwelling Unit

	10 – 40	300 sq ft

	41 – 100	250 sq ft

	Units over 100	150 sq ft

*To illustrate the implementation of Table 20.100.130(3), a 110-lot subdivision would require 300 square feet of open space per unit for the first 40 units, 250 square feet of open space for the next 60 units, and 150 square feet of open space for the final 10 units. (40*300)+(60*250)+(10*150)= 28,500 square feet of required open space for a 110-lot subdivision.

(b) The requirements in Table 20.100.130(3) may be reduced by up to 50 percent for residential development that is located within one-quarter mile walking distance of a public park. The director shall determine the amount of reduction based on the following:

(i) The availability of safe pedestrian facilities connecting the development to the park;

(ii) The ability of the park facilities to accommodate additional usage by residents of the development; and

(iii) The number of park facilities located within one-quarter-mile distance.

(4) On-Site Open Space Design.

(a) On-site recreation open space shall be designed as follows:

(i) On-site recreation open space shall be located in a separate tract from the residential dwellings; shall have an undivided ownership interest by the homeowners of the development; and shall have a deed restriction recorded for the tract that restricts the use of the tract to recreational uses;

(ii) At least 40 percent of the total required on-site recreation open space shall be consolidated in one location within the development;

(iii) At least 75 percent of the total required on-site recreation open space shall be located outside of critical areas other than buffers identified in Chapter 20.162 POMC;

(iv) On-site recreation open space shall be developed for active and passive uses. At least 50 percent of the on-site recreation open space shall be designed and improved for one or more active uses. When an area of on-site recreation open space is designed and improved for active uses other than improved pedestrian or bicycle paths with hard surfaces, the average width of the area shall be at least equal to half of the average length of the area. Active uses include, but are not limited to:

(A) Playgrounds developed with children’s play equipment;

(B) Improved pedestrian or bicycle paths with hard surfaces;

(C) Sports fields (such as soccer or softball fields), with associated improvements;

(D) Indoor or outdoor sports courts (such as volleyball, basketball or tennis courts), swimming pools, and similar facilities;

(E) Picnic areas with permanent tables, benches or gazebos;

(F) Community clubhouse and meeting facilities;

(G) Community gardens for use by the residents;

(H) Plazas with lighting, artwork, and sitting space for pedestrians at four or more spaces for every required 100 square feet of area; and

(I) Other similar uses approved by the director;

(v) Passive uses include critical areas that cannot be developed, nature interpretive areas, bird watching facilities, unimproved trails, and similar uses approved by the director;

(vi) The following drainage facilities may be counted as on-site passive recreation space:

(A) Unfenced detention, retention and wet ponds; provided, that pathways and viewing areas surround the pond;

(B) Stormwater treatment wetlands;

(C) Stormwater infiltration trenches and bioswales that serve more than one dwelling; and

(D) Vegetated areas located above underground detention facilities;

(vii) No on-site recreation open space tract shall contain less than 700 square feet in area;

(viii) On-site recreation open space shall have at least 50 feet of frontage on a public right-of-way or private street tract;

(ix) All recreation open space tracts shall be developed, landscaped and maintained so that a high level of visibility is provided from the public right-of-way or private street tract to playgrounds and other areas intended primarily for use by children;

(x) If a single active on-site recreation open space tract is provided, it shall be centrally located within the subdivision, so that it is within one-quarter-mile walking distance for at least 90 percent of the dwelling units. If the subdivision area is too large for this standard to be met with one recreation open space tract, an additional recreation open space tract or tracts shall be required;

(xi) Access for pedestrians shall be provided from all dwellings within the development to the on-site recreation space through trails, sidewalks, pathways and other similar means of access; and

(xii) On-site recreation space shall not include privately owned yards. (Ord. 030-19 § 2).

Article I. Introduction


20.127.010 Purpose.

This chapter implements the Port Orchard comprehensive plan. Overall, the purpose of this chapter is to:

(1) Provide clear objectives for those embarking on the planning and design of development projects in Port Orchard.

(2) Preserve and protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Port Orchard.

(3) Ensure that new commercial and multi-household development is of high quality and beneficially contributes to Port Orchard’s character.

(4) Upgrade the visual appearance of Port Orchard’s principal vehicular corridors.

(5) Ensure that new developments within existing neighborhoods are compatible with, and enhance the character of, Port Orchard’s neighborhoods.

(6) Promote an increase in walking and bicycling throughout the city.

(7) Enhance the livability of Port Orchard’s residential developments.

(8) Maintain and enhance property values within Port Orchard. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.020 Applicability and compliance.

(1) Applicability. The provisions of this chapter apply to all development within Port Orchard, except:

(a) Detached houses, backyard cottages, cottage courts (cottages), side-by-side duplexes, back-to-back duplexes, attached houses, and townhomes as defined in Chapter 20.32 POMC shall not be required to comply with this chapter. Design standards for detached houses, backyard cottages, cottage courts (cottages), side-by-side duplexes, back-to-back duplexes, attached houses, and townhomes are found in Chapter 20.139 POMC. Subdivision design standards are found in Chapter 20.100 POMC.

(b) Properties within the designated Old Clifton Industrial Park. See the figure below for a map clarifying the location of properties which are exempt.

Figure 20.127.020(1) Old Clifton Industrial Park
[IMAGE]


(c) Open-air structures such as pavilions, stages and gazebos for ornamental, performance or recreational use.

(d) The director may waive these provisions in other employment – industrial/office zoned properties where they are screened from view from the public right-of-way and adjacent nonemployment – industrial/office properties by a minimum 20-foot-wide landscaped buffer meeting the requirements of Chapter 20.128 POMC – full screening or by preservation of comparable existing landscaping on the site.

(2) Relationship to Other Codes and Documents. Where provisions of this chapter conflict with provisions in any other section of the Port Orchard design standards, this chapter prevails unless otherwise noted herein.

(3) For building additions, remodels, and site improvements, three different thresholds have been established to gauge how the design standards in this chapter are applied to such projects. See Figure 20.127.020(3) below for examples of site development and the respective types of improvements required under each of the three levels of improvements.

(a) Level I improvements include all exterior remodels, building additions, and/or site improvements that affect the exterior appearance of the building/site or cumulatively increase the gross floor area by up to 20 percent of the gross square footage that existed three years prior to the date of permit issuance. The requirement for such improvements is only that the proposed improvements meet the standards and do not lead to further nonconformance with the standards.

For example, if a property owner decides to replace a building facade’s siding, then the siding must meet the applicable exterior building material standards, but elements such as building articulation (see POMC 20.127.430) would not be required.

(b) Level II improvements include all improvements that cumulatively increase the gross floor area by 20 percent or more, but not greater than 75 percent, of the gross square footage that existed three years prior to the date of permit issuance. All standards that do not relate to repositioning the building or reconfiguring site development apply to Level II improvements. For example, if a property owner of an existing home in the BP zone wants to convert the home to an office and build an addition equaling 45 percent of the current building’s area, then the following elements would apply:

(i) The location and design of the addition/remodel must be consistent with the block frontage standards (see Article II of this chapter), to the extent possible given the location of the existing building. For such developments seeking additions to buildings where an off-street parking location currently does not comply with applicable parking location standards, building additions are allowed provided they do not increase any current nonconformity and generally bring the project closer into conformance with the standards. See Figure 20.127.020(3) for an example of this.

(ii) Comply with applicable site planning and design elements (see Article III of this chapter).

(iii) Comply with all building design provisions of Article IV of this chapter, except architectural scale and materials provisions related to the existing portion of the building where no exterior changes are proposed. The entire building must comply with building elements/details, materials, and blank wall treatment standards of POMC 20.127.440 through 20.127.460.

(iv) The proposed improvements shall comply with the off-street parking, landscaping, and signage provisions of Chapters 20.124, 20.128, and 20.132 POMC.

(c) Level III improvements include all improvements that cumulatively increase the gross floor area by more than 75 percent of the gross square footage that existed three years prior to the date of permit issuance. Such developments must conform to all applicable standards.

Figure 20.127.020(3) Examples of Improvement Types and Required Compliance
[IMAGE]


(4) Review for Compliance. Proposals for development, including design standard departure requests, shall be reviewed for consistency with the design standards as found in this chapter in conjunction with every underlying permit application(s) (i.e., building permit, stormwater drainage permit, conditional use permit, binding site plan, etc.) at each stage of the development. The city recognizes that every project is unique and that permits are not always submitted in a single package simultaneously. For instance, a project may require a conditional use permit, building permit, land disturbing activity permit, and stormwater drainage permit. It is common that a building permit application be submitted after site development activities have begun. It is also common to develop building pads for future construction as part of an approved development. (Ord. 056-19 § 22; Ord. 011-19 § 6 (Exh. 3); Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.030 Optional design review board project recommendation.

Applicants for development subject to the design standards contained in this chapter may optionally request that the city’s design review board provide project review and a recommendation on the application.

When requested by the applicant, the design review board shall review permit applications for consistency with this chapter and make a recommendation to the director or hearing examiner, as appropriate to the permit type, who shall give substantial weight to the recommendation of the design review board as long as that recommendation does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter and is consistent with its purposes. Requests for optional design review board project recommendations shall be made at the time of permit application submittal. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.040 Supplemental submittal requirements.

A preapplication meeting is strongly recommended to determine which of the below listed supplemental application materials are needed for a specific development in order to determine compliance with the design standards. Applications subject to review under this chapter may be deemed incomplete if they are missing any of the following materials, as needed to determine compliance with the design standards:

(1) Block Frontage Standards.

(a) Identification of the block frontage type(s) applicable to the development.

(4) Departures. If any departures are requested, such elements must be clearly identified in the above materials. Documentation to support how such proposed departures meet the applicable approval criteria must be included. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.050 Pre-submittal design review.

(1) It is the city’s intent to offer a pre-submittal design review process to allow applicants to vet their building and site designs prior to completing full architectural and engineering construction plans required for technical plan review and permit application submittal. Applicants seeking pre-submittal design review may request that a preliminary review of conceptual site and/or building plans be conducted by the director to evaluate consistency with the design standards found in this chapter.

(2) Anyone seeking pre-submittal design review shall:

(a) Complete an application form.

(b) Pay the appropriate fee as set by resolution.

(c) Submit conceptual plans along with the materials listed in POMC 20.127.040 to the department of community development.

(3) The director shall review the request for pre-submittal design review and provide a pre-submittal design review letter and/or marked up plans describing which portions of the conceptual design meet and do not meet the design standards.

(4) Any letter and/or marked up plans generated in a pre-submittal design review shall not be considered a final decision and are only intended to assist an applicant in the preparation of complete application materials. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.060 Departures.

(1) Overview and Purpose. This chapter provides for a number of specific departure opportunities to development standards. For brevity in tables, departure opportunities are noted with the  symbol. The purpose of this section is to provide applicants with the option of proposing alternative design treatments, provided such departures meet the “purpose” of the particular standard and any additional departure criteria set forth for the particular departure opportunity.

(2) Departures Are Voluntary. This provision allows the flexibility for applicants to propose alternative designs on a voluntary basis as provided herein.

(3) Variances versus Departures. Variances, as set forth in Chapter 20.28 POMC, require conditions in place on the property, not created by the property owner, that create practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in complying with the applicable development regulations. Such conditions are not necessary in order to qualify for departures, which can be proposed as an alternative to complying with specific design standards in this chapter provided they comply with approval criteria listed in subsection (6) of this section.

(4) Applicability. Departure opportunities are available only to those specific standards that allow for departures.

(5) Review Procedures. Departure requests are to be reviewed in conjunction with the underlying development permit and processed as set forth in POMC 20.127.020(1) and Chapters 20.22, 20.24 and 20.25 POMC.

(6) Approval Criteria. Project applicants must successfully demonstrate to the reviewing authority (the director or hearing examiner, as appropriate to the permit type) how the proposed departure meets the purpose(s) of the standard and other applicable departure criteria that apply to the specific standard.

(7) Documentation. For each departure approved, the reviewing authority must make findings that document the manner in which the departure satisfies the approval criteria in subsection (6) of this section. The findings are to be maintained with project application records for the purpose of providing consistency in decision-making by the city. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

Article II. Block Frontage Standards


20.127.100 Purpose.

(1) To provide standards to implement the comprehensive plan and applicable adopted sub-area plans.

(2) To design sites and orient buildings with an emphasis on compatible development and creating a comfortable walking environment.

(3) To provide standards that recognize the need for a system of streets and block frontages. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.110 Applicability and compliance.

The provisions of this article apply to all development within Port Orchard, except detached single-family and two-family (duplex) dwellings in any configuration. (Single-family and duplex design standards are found in Chapter 20.139 POMC.) Also:

(1) Applicability.

(a) See POMC 20.127.020(1) for clarification on the types of development to which these standards apply.

(b) See POMC 20.127.020(2) for the relationship between the provisions in this article and other documents and codes.

(c) See POMC 20.127.020(3) for the application of building additions and remodels and site improvements.

(2) The default block frontage for new streets in commercial and mixed use zones is other (POMC 20.127.210) unless a designation is already provided. The default block frontage for undesignated streets within annexed land is varied (POMC 20.127.170).

(3) The block frontage designations apply to development on both sides of the street except where otherwise specified on the maps. For example, on a street with two designations, the designation on the east side of the street applies to properties on the east side of the street. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.120 How to use this chapter.

(1) About the Maps. The maps together with the block frontage standards in POMC 20.127.150 through 20.127.250 guide the look and feel of development in commercial and multi-household areas throughout Port Orchard when viewed from the street. The provisions herein recognize that there is a hierarchy of different streets and block frontage types ranging from the pedestrian-oriented storefronts to arterial streets/frontages that warrant greater flexibility in the design of frontages.

The block frontage standards address site planning and building design elements including:

(a) Building location and orientation.

(b) Parking lot location.

(c) Window transparency.

(d) Weather protection.

(e) Landscaping.

The community design framework maps also identify high visibility street corner sites that warrant special design treatment. Refer to POMC 20.127.250 for high visibility street corner requirements.

(2) Block frontage standards for individual properties depend on the type of street properties front onto. Thus, consider the following steps in using this article:

(a) Go to the maps in POMC 20.127.130 to find the property and the block frontage type designation for the street or streets fronting the property. For properties in residential zones, the standards for landscaped block frontages apply (POMC 20.127.160). For properties that front onto multiple streets, see POMC 20.127.240.

(b) Table 20.127.120(2) summarizes standards for each of the designated block frontage types. Go to the appropriate section in this article for the detailed and applicable block frontage standards for applicable block frontage type designation.

20.127.140 About the transparency standards.

All block frontage designations contain distinct minimum facade transparency standards. The purpose of these standards are to maintain “eyes on the street” for safety and create a welcoming pedestrian environment. Table 20.127.140 below includes details in how they are measured.

 

Table 20.127.140 Clarification of Transparency Standards  

	Transparency Zones

	Storefront	Ground floor nonresidential and nonstorefront	Residential buildings and residential portions of mixed use buildings

	
[IMAGE]
	
[IMAGE]
	
[IMAGE]


	The transparency zone is on the ground floor between 30 inches and 10 feet above sidewalk grade	The transparency zone is between 30 inches and 8 feet above grade 	All vertical surfaces of the facade are used in the calculations

	Other Transparency Provisions

	Windows must be transparent

Ground level window area for storefronts and other nonresidential uses that is covered, frosted, or perforated in any manner that obscures visibility into the building must not count as transparent window area.

Exception: Window signs conforming with POMC 20.132.280 may be counted as transparent window area provided the areas generally around the sign are transparent.	
[IMAGE]
	
[IMAGE]


	Display windows

Display window may be used for up to 50 percent of nonresidential transparency requirements provided they are at least 30 inches deep and allow changeable displays. Tack-on display cases as in the far right example don’t qualify as transparent window area.	
[IMAGE]
	
[IMAGE]


	Integrated display windows 	Tack-on display cases

	Structured parking facilities

Where structured parking facilities occupy a portion of the facade, any openings simulating windows may be used to help comply with transparency requirements.

20.127.150 Storefront block frontage standards.

(1) Description/Purpose. Storefront block frontages are the most vibrant and active shopping and dining areas within the city and serve the purpose of attracting pedestrians to enliven the streetscape. Blocks designated as storefront blocks include continuous storefronts placed along the sidewalk edge with small scale shops and/or frequent business entries.

Figure 20.127.150(1) Storefront Vision and Key Standards
[IMAGE]


(2) Standards. All development as set forth in POMC 20.127.130 on sites containing a storefront block frontage designation must comply with the following standards (on applicable block frontages):

Table 20.127.150(2) Storefront Block Frontage Standards  

	Element	Standards	Examples and Notes

	Ground floor	 	 

	Land use	Nonresidential uses, except for lobbies associated with residential or hotel/motel uses on upper floors.	 

	Floor to ceiling height	15 feet minimum (applies to new buildings only). 	 

	Retail space depth	20 feet minimum (applies to new buildings only). 	 

	Building placement	Required at front property line/back edge of sidewalk. Additional setbacks are allowed for widened sidewalks, pedestrian-oriented space (POMC 20.127.350(4)), or where additional future right-of-way acquisition is planned by the city.	 
[IMAGE]


	Building entrances	Must face the street. For corner buildings, entrances may face the street corner.

	Facade transparency	60 percent minimum. 	Also see POMC 20.127.140 for additional clarification on transparency standards.

	Weather protection	Weather protection with 8 to 15 feet vertical clearance at least 6 feet in minimum depth along at least 80 percent of facade. 

Retractable awnings may be used to meet these requirements.

Weather protection must not obstruct utility poles or street trees.

Weather protection shall comply with WSDOT standards for setback from the face of the curb and may have the effect of reducing the minimum weather protection depth.	For downtown properties on Bay Street and adjacent to the city-owned marquee, new development may utilize the existing marquee (subject to approval by the public works director) or new independent weather protection to meet this provision.

	Parking location

Also see Chapter 20.124 POMC for related parking requirements	New surface or ground level parking areas must be placed to the side or rear of structures and are limited to 60 feet of street frontage. 

Provide a 6-foot minimum buffer of landscaping between the street and off-street parking areas meeting the standards of Chapter 20.128 POMC. 	
[IMAGE]


	Sidewalk width	12 feet minimum between curb edge and storefront, including a minimum walking surface width of 8 feet and a clear/buffer zone with street trees. 	 
[IMAGE]


(3) Departure Criteria. Departures from the above standards that feature the  symbol will be considered by the reviewing authority (the director or hearing examiner, as appropriate), provided the alternative proposal meets the purpose of the standards, plus the following criteria:

(a) Retail Space Depth. Reduced depths will be considered where the applicant can successfully demonstrate the proposed alternative design and configuration of the space is viable for a variety of permitted retail uses;

(b) Facade Transparency. The proposed alternative design treatment of facade area between ground level windows provides visual interest to the pedestrian and mitigates impacts of any blank wall areas. No less than 40 percent of the facade between 30 inches and 10 feet above the sidewalk may be approved with a departure;

(c) Weather Protection. Other proposed alternative design treatments must provide equivalent weather protection benefits;

(d)  Parking Location. There must be an acceptable tradeoff in terms of the amount and quality of storefront area that is integrated with the development and the applicable parking location departure. Plus, the alternative must include design features to successfully mitigate the visual impact of additional parking areas along designated storefront streets; and

(e) Sidewalk Width. Alternative designs may be considered where topographical challenges exist. Alternative designs must be able to accommodate safe and comfortable pedestrian traffic anticipated for full block development. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.160 Landscaped block frontage standards.

(1) Description/Purpose. The landscaped block frontage designation emphasizes landscaped frontages and clear pedestrian connections between buildings and the sidewalk and serves the purpose of including attractive vegetation within the streetscape. This designation applies to all streets designated landscaped in POMC 20.127.130, Community design framework maps, and the all development in residential zones.

Example of low level landscaping that screens foundation walls, provides visual interest, and maintains views from dwelling units to the street.

	Sidewalk width	Six-foot minimum sidewalks are required.

Wider sidewalks may be required where designated in other code sections or in the public works standards.	 

(3) Departure Criteria. Departures from the above standards that feature the  symbol will be considered by the reviewing authority (the director or hearing examiner, as appropriate), provided the alternative proposal meets the purpose of the standards, plus the following criteria:

(a) Building Entrances. Block frontages with steep slopes and/or those facing busy arterial streets and very limited pedestrian traffic may warrant some flexibility to this standard (particularly in residential districts).

(b) Facade Transparency. The proposed alternative design treatment of facade area between ground level windows provides visual interest to the pedestrian and mitigates impacts of any blank wall areas. No less than 40 percent of the facade between 30 inches and 10 feet above the sidewalk may be approved with a departure.

(c) Parking Location. There must be an acceptable tradeoff in terms of the amount and quality of landscaped area that is integrated with the development and the applicable parking location departure. Plus, the alternative must include design features to successfully mitigate the visual impact of additional parking areas along designated landscaped streets. (Ord. 056-19 § 24; Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

(3) Departure Criteria. See the departure criteria for storefront frontages, POMC 20.127.150(3). (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.210 Other block frontage standards.

(1) Description/Purpose. All other block frontages in districts that are not designated in the design framework maps are provided greater flexibility with regards to the design of development frontages. These block frontages include a combination of side streets (where most uses front on other adjacent streets) and service oriented streets (often characterized by industrial or service types of uses). While there is greater flexibility in the amount of transparency of facade and the location of surface and structured parking, the purpose of these standards is to ensure that development frontages along these streets provide visual interest at all observable scales and meet the design objectives of the city.

(2) Standards. All development as set forth in POMC 20.127.130 with applicable block frontage designations must comply with standards below (on applicable block frontages):

Table 20.127.210(2) Other Block Frontage Standards 

	Element	Standards

	Building placement	Where allowed in the applicable zoning district, buildings may be placed up to the sidewalk edge provided storefront block frontage standards above are met (except where otherwise noted herein).

10-foot minimum front setback for other buildings, except where greater setbacks are specified in the district per Chapter 20.122 POMC. 

See POMC 20.127.230 for special design provisions associated with ground level residential uses adjacent to a sidewalk.

	Building entrances	Building entrances facing the street are encouraged. At a minimum, at least one building entry visible and directly accessible from the street is required. 

Where buildings are setback from the street, pedestrian connections are required from the sidewalk.

	Facade transparency	For storefronts, at least 60 percent of ground floor between 30 inches and 10 feet above the sidewalk is required. 

Other buildings designed with nonresidential uses on the ground floor within 10 feet of sidewalk, at least 30 percent of the ground floor between four and eight feet above the sidewalk. 

Other buildings, at least 10 percent of the entire facade (all vertical surfaces generally facing the street). 

	Weather protection	At least three feet deep over primary business and residential entries.

	Parking location

Also see Chapter 20.124 POMC for related parking requirements	There are no parking lot location restrictions.

A 10-foot buffer of landscaping between the street and off-street parking areas meeting the performance standards of Chapter 20.128 POMC is required. 

	Landscaping

Also see Chapter 20.128 POMC for related landscaping standards	The area between the street and building must be landscaped and/or include private porch or patio space.

For setbacks adjacent to buildings with windows, provide low level landscaping that maintains views between the building and the street.

Also provide plant materials that screen any blank walls and add visual interest at both the pedestrian scale and motorist scale. For extended wall areas, provide for a diversity of plant materials and textures to maintain visual interest from a pedestrian scale.

	Sidewalk width	Where storefront buildings are proposed, sidewalks must meet storefront block frontage standards above. Otherwise, six-foot wide minimum sidewalks are required.

(3) Departure Criteria. Departures from the above standards that feature the  symbol will be considered by the reviewing authority (the director or hearing examiner, as appropriate) provided the alternative proposal meets the purpose of the standards, plus the following criteria:

(a) Minimum Setback. Provide design treatments that create an effective transition between the public and private realm. This could include a stoop design to other similar treatments that utilize a low fence, retaining wall, and/or hedge alone the sidewalk.

(b) Facade Transparency. The design treatment of a facade and/or landscape element provides visual interest to the pedestrian and mitigates impacts of any blank wall area. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.220 Trail/park frontage standards.

Trails referenced in the community design framework maps in POMC 20.127.130 aligned adjacent to a street are subject to the applicable block frontage designation for the street. For trails referenced in the community design framework maps that are not adjacent to streets, developments fronting such trails must comply with the other block frontage standards set forth in POMC 20.127.210.

Figure 20.127.220 Trail/Park Frontage Examples
[IMAGE]


The development in the left image includes a courtyard that orients towards the trail. The low fence allows visibility between the uses, yet divides public and private space in an acceptable manner. The right image illustrates an active commercial use fronting on the trail.

(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.230 Special residential frontage standards along sidewalks and internal walkways.

For residences with ground floor living spaces facing a sidewalk or pedestrian path in a residential or mixed use development, the building must feature at least one of the public/private space transition elements described below. The objective of this standard is to ensure privacy and security for residents, and an attractive and safe walkway that complements the qualities of the adjoining residences within a residential complex.

(1) Raised Deck or Porch Option. Provide at least a 60-square-foot porch or deck raised at least one foot above grade. The porch or deck must be at least six feet wide, measured perpendicular to the building face. (The deck may be recessed into the unit floor plan so that deck does not extend from the building face a full six feet.) A low fence, rail or hedge, two feet to four feet high, may be integrated between the sidewalk or internal walkway and deck or porch.

(2) Front Setback Options. Provide a minimum 10-foot setback between the sidewalk or internal walkway and the face of the residence. Design options for the front setback:

(a) Landscaped area, meeting the provisions of Chapter 20.128 POMC.

(b) Semi-private patio space screened by a low fence or hedge (see Chapter 20.128 POMC, Development Standards – Landscaping).

(3) Raised Ground Floor. If the residence’s ground floor is a minimum of three feet above the grade adjacent to the building, then the landscaped area in subsection (2)(b) of this section, may be reduced to four feet wide (except where greater setbacks are specified for the applicable zoning district in Chapter 20.122 POMC).

Departures: Other transition design measure that adequately protects the privacy and comfort of the residential unit and the attractiveness and usefulness of the walkway at least as effectively as subsections (1) through this subsection (3).

See Figure 20.127.230 below for examples of the above treatments.

(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.240 Where a property fronts onto multiple streets/frontage designations.

Where a property fronts onto more than one street and each street has a different frontage designation, each building frontage must comply with the standards for the block frontage upon which it fronts, with the following clarifications:

(1) Where a conflict exists between frontage standards, the review authority will apply the standards of a block frontage pursuant to the following order of preference:

(a) Storefront.

(b) Varied.

(c) Marine.

(d) Landscaped.

(e) Gateway.

(f) Other.

Subsections (2) through (5) of this section clarify how the order of preference works for particular frontage elements.

(2) Building Location. For corner sites with landscaped block frontage on one street and storefront or varied on another, a storefront frontage may wrap around the corner (on the landscaped block frontage side) for up to a half block width or no more than 120 feet (whichever is more).

(3) Entrances. For corner sites, entrances on both streets are encouraged, but only one entrance is required. For corner sites with frontage on a storefront block frontage on one side, an entrance must be placed on the storefront block frontage side. For corner sites with a mix of designations that do not include a storefront block frontage, the entry must be placed in the order of preference identified above.

Departures may be considered, provided the location and design of the entry and block frontage treatments are compatible with the character of the area and enhance the character of the street.

(4) Transparency. For corner sites at least one block frontage must meet the applicable transparency standards (based on the order of preference above). For the second block frontage, the review authority may approve a reduction in the minimum amount of transparency by 50 percent. For street corners with the same designations on both frontages, buildings must employ the full transparency on the dominant frontage (based on the frontage width or established neighborhood pattern).

(5) Parking. Surface parking (including ground floor parking in a structure) adjacent to a street corner is not allowed, except:

(a) Corner lots with nondesignated frontages (other) on both streets.

(b) Other combination of block frontages, except those with a storefront designation, via a departure and subject to the applicable departure criteria.

20.127.260 Community design framework master plan.

Recently annexed or rezoned commercial or mixed use properties along with large undeveloped sites necessitate a different approach to applying block frontage standards. The provisions below identify the purpose, applicable sites, block frontage designation options, and special standards for developing community design framework master plans. Such master plans are also an option for property owners to change designations on existing community design framework maps (POMC 20.127.130).

(1) Purpose.

(a) To provide a thoughtful and fair process to plan for the development of large and new commercial and mixed use sites consistent with Port Orchard’s comprehensive plan.

(b) To promote the arrangement of streets, buildings, open space, parking and service areas that creates a strong sense of community and enhances the character of Port Orchard.

(c) To avoid uncoordinated patterns of development that waste valuable land, compromise vehicular and pedestrian access, and degrade the character of Port Orchard.

(2) Applicable Sites.

(a) Recently annexed sites zoned as one of the commercial or mixed use zoning districts.

(b) Sites recently rezoned to one of the commercial or mixed use zoning districts that are not addressed in the community design framework maps in POMC 20.127.130.

(3) Block Frontage Designations Options.

(a) Prior to site development of applicable sites, a community design framework master plan must be developed, approved and adopted into the Port Orchard comprehensive plan per the procedures set forth in Chapter 20.04 POMC, Comprehensive Plan Amendments. The master plans must include:

(i) New streets and internal roadways along with block frontage designations (types included in this section).

(ii) Any designated high visibility street corners.

(iii) Any planned open spaces, trails, and shared use paths.

(iv) Any special phasing conditions.

(v) Other special design conditions unique to the site and plan that must be implemented with future site plan development.

(b) Community design framework master plans may utilize any existing block frontage designations that border the site, or include an alternative block frontage designation type or types, subject to master plan approval.

(c) Alternatively, site plan development may occur on applicable sites without an approved and recorded community design framework master plan provided all block frontages comply with the standards for varied block frontages as set forth in subsection (4) of this section.

(4) Design Standards. Community design framework master plans must meet the purpose as set forth above plus the following parameters for specific sites:

Table 20.127.260(4) Community Design Framework Master Plan Design Standards 

	The provisions below are intended to guide the design of individual community design framework master plans. They are referred to as standards, since all proposed plans must successfully demonstrate how they comply with the provisions herein.

	All Sites	•    Configure site to create a pedestrian-oriented focal point. Such a focal point could be a main street (storefront), a central square surrounded by storefronts or other similar features.

•    Larger sites have greater expectations in the amount of storefront designated frontages. 

•    Goals, policies and concepts from adopted plans must be used to help determine compliance with these standards.

(a) For sites with multiple buildings, pedestrian paths or walkways connecting businesses and residential entries on the same development site must be provided. Routes that minimize walking distances must be utilized to the extent practical.

Departures will be allowed where steep slopes prevent a direct connection or where an indirect route would enhance the design and/or use of a common usable open space. See subsection (4) of this section for walkway design standards.

Figure 20.127.330(3)(a) Internal and External Pedestrian Connections Are Important
[IMAGE]


(b) Sites with Residential Units. Provide direct pedestrian access between all ground related unit entries and a public street or to a clearly marked walkway network or open space that has direct access to a public street. Residential developments must provide a pedestrian circulation network that connects all main entrances on the site to other areas of the site, such as:

(i) Parking areas.

(ii) Recreational areas.

(iii) Common outdoor areas.

(iv) Any pedestrian amenities.

For townhouses or other residential units fronting the street, the sidewalk may be used to meet this standard. 

 Figure 20.127.330(3)(b)(i) Direct Walkways between the Street and Dwelling Units Are Required
[IMAGE]


The entries of the example on the left connect directly to a public sidewalk while the entries in the right example connect to a common path that extends to the sidewalk.

Figure 20.127.330(3)(b)(ii) Examples of Attractive Pedestrian Connection through a Residential Development
[IMAGE]


(c) Crosswalks are required when a walkway crosses an on-site paved area accessible to vehicles. Crosswalks must contain contrasting material (such as concrete) and/or patterns (such as stamped asphalt), excluding painted surfaces.

(d) Pedestrian Walkways through Parking Lots. Developments with 50 parking spaces or more must provide specially marked or paved walkways through parking areas. At least one walkway must be provided every four rows of parking or at a maximum spacing of 200 feet. The walkways must provide a safe connection to the building entrance and meet the walkway design standards set forth in subsection (4) of this section. See examples below.

Figure 20.127.330(3)(d) Parking Area Walkway Standards and Examples
[IMAGE]


Note the location of the parking lot walkway in the upper right example (connecting shops in one building to the main entry of a grocery store).
[IMAGE]


Note in both examples that the concrete walkway extends into the vehicular area to provide a highly visible and safe crosswalk.

(e) Connections to Adjacent Properties (Including Parks and Trails). Except for when adjacent properties have less than five dwelling units, provide pedestrian walkways that connect to adjacent properties. Public sidewalks in the right-of-way shall not count towards this requirement.

Departures will be allowed where it is determined that internal connections are not necessary or practical due to shallow lot depths, steep slopes, or other contextual challenges.

(f) Barriers that limit future pedestrian access are prohibited. Gates that limit access to employees are permitted. See subsection (4) of this section for walkway design standards.

(4) Walkway Design.

(a) All internal pedestrian walkways must have a minimum five-foot-wide unobstructed walking surface, except where wider walkways are prescribed in this article or where the applicable uses and context dictate wider walkways.

(b) Where parking is adjacent to perpendicular or angled parking, an extra two feet of walkway width must be provided to mitigate for parked vehicles overhanging the walkway.

(c) Pedestrian walks must be separated from structures at least three feet for landscaping except where the adjacent building facade meets the storefront block frontage standards per POMC 20.127.120(2).

Departures will be considered where other landscaping and/or facade design treatments to provide attractive walkways are proposed. Examples include sculptural, mosaic, bas-relief artwork, or other decorative treatments that meet the purpose. Figure 20.127.330(4)(c) below provides one example.

Figure 20.127.330(4)(c) Standards for Internal Walkways Adjacent to Buildings
[IMAGE]


Internal walkways adjacent to building walls that do not meet storefront facade standards must provide at least three feet of landscaping to enhance the character of the walkway. The reviewing authority will consider alternative treatments, such as decorative walls (right example).

(d) Walkway design where multi-tenant commercial or mixed use buildings 100 feet or more in length abut parking lots. Such walkways must feature a 12-foot wide sidewalk with:

(i) Eight feet minimum unobstructed width.

(ii) Trees, as approved by the director or hearing examiner, placed at an average of 50 feet on-center and placed in grates or in planting strips as set forth in subsection (4)(d)(iii) of this section.

Departure: Breaks in the tree coverage will be allowed near major building entries to enhance visibility.

(iii) Planting strips may be used between any vehicle access or parking area and the walkway; provided, that the trees required above are included and the walkway meets the applicable width standards herein and the combined walkway and planting strip is at least 12 feet wide.

(iv) See also POMC 20.127.340(4), internal roadway design.

20.127.340 Vehicular circulation and parking.

The standards herein supplement the provisions of public works standards and Chapter 20.124 POMC. Where there is a conflict, the provisions herein apply, except that the public works director may override this requirement and apply the public works standard for a driveway if the public works director finds that a failure to apply the public works standards will result in a threat to public safety.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To create a safe, convenient, and efficient network for vehicle circulation and parking.

(b) To enhance the visual character of interior access roads.

(c) To minimize conflicts with pedestrian circulation and activity.

(2) Driveway Provisions.

(a) Driveways must comply with the public works standards. Where there is a conflict between the driveway provisions in this chapter and those in the public works standards, the driveway provisions in this chapter apply, except that the public works director may override this requirement and apply the public works standard for a driveway if the public works director finds that a failure to apply the public works standards will result in a threat to public safety.

(b) Drive aisles must meet the standards set forth in POMC 20.124.100, Off-street parking design standards.

(c) Minimize parking lot entrances, drive aisles, and other vehicle access routes onto private property from a public right-of-way through the following means:

(i) Driveway lanes crossing a public sidewalk must be no wider than the minimum required per entry or exit lane. The city may impose additional restrictions to parking lot and vehicle access points to reduce impacts to public safety, pedestrian movement, on-street vehicle circulation, and visual qualities.

(ii) Minimize the number of driveway entrances and comply with the public works standards for driveway entrances.

(iii) The reviewing authority may require joint drive aisles serving adjacent developments when joint access is physically and legally available.

(iv) Minimize conflicts between entries and vehicle parking and maneuvering areas.

(v) At street corner sites, drive aisles must be located on the lowest classified roadway and as close as practical to the property line most distant from the intersection, unless the reviewing authority finds there is a compelling reason to the contrary.


[IMAGE]


(d) Port Orchard Boulevard Access. Access from Port Orchard Boulevard except for areas with a designated block frontage as shown in the community design framework maps in POMC 20.127.130 shall be prohibited.

(3) Intersite Connectivity. The provision of through vehicle access connections between commercially or nonresidentially zoned properties is required except where the reviewing authority determines it is infeasible or undesirable (e.g., where it is determined that such a vehicle connection would impact safe pedestrian movement). See Article II of this chapter for specific block frontage standards. Vehicle access may be in the form of a dedicated or private alley, connected or shared parking lots, shared drive aisles, or similar features.

(4) Internal Roadway Design.

(a) To increase the function and appearance of internal roadways on large sites (greater than two acres), street trees and sidewalks must be provided on all internal access roadways, excepting access roads designed solely for the purpose of service (e.g., waste pick-up) and loading.

(b) In some instances where traffic speed and volume are low, the reviewing authority may approve a street where vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian movement are mixed such as in a “woonerf” or “shared street.” Woonerf streets must feature traffic calming and safety measures as well as landscape and amenity features as determined by the reviewing authority.

The examples above include angled parking and planter strips with street trees. Pedestrian-scaled lighting also contributes to the character in the upper right image.
[IMAGE]


The above left image illustrates a thoroughfare lane with a row of street trees. A sidewalk is included on one side of the street to provide a strategic connection between businesses. The right image illustrates the curbless “woonerf” design where travel speeds are low and lanes are shared between pedestrians and vehicles.

(c) Drive-Through Facilities. Where allowed, drive-through facilities (e.g., drive-up windows) must comply with the following:

(i) Drive-through lanes, including waiting and holding lanes, must be buffered from the street and internal walkways by one or both of the following:

(A) A planting strip at least five feet wide with continuous plantings of evergreen shrubs and/or trees that will, at maturity, provide a continuous evergreen screen at least four feet tall.

(B) A wall at least three feet high constructed of brick, stone or siding materials that matches the principal walls of the building to which the sign applies.

Departure: Alternative screening schemes may be approved provided they include both the wall and a substantial vegetative screen. The landscaping must comply with Chapter 20.128 POMC.

(ii) Drive-through lanes must not restrict pedestrian access between a public sidewalk and on-site buildings. Walkways must not be located within required stacking space as set forth in the public works standards.

(iii) This section contains standards for drive-through lanes and facilities. Signs associated with drive-through lanes are regulated under POMC 20.132.150(7). (Ord. 056-19 § 23; Ord. 011-19 § 6 (Exh. 3); Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.350 On-site open space.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To create useable space that is suitable for leisure or recreational activities for residents.

(b) To create open space that contributes to the residential setting.

(c) To provide plazas that attract shoppers to commercial areas.

(d) To provide plazas and other pedestrian oriented spaces in commercial areas that enhance the employees’ and public’s opportunity for active and passive activities, such as dining, resting, people watching, and recreational activities.

(e) To enhance the development character and attractiveness of commercial development.

(2) Usable Residential Open Space.

(a) All multi-household development, including multi-household portions of mixed use development, must provide minimum usable open space equal to 100 square feet per dwelling unit for studio and one-bedroom dwellings and 150 square feet per dwelling unit for dwellings with two or more bedrooms.

Developments adjacent to or across the street from a public park can qualify for a 50 percent reduction in the required open space via a departure, where it is determined that both the park and access to the park help to meet the usable open space purpose.

The required open space may be provided in a combination of ways:

(i) Shared Open Space. One hundred percent of the required open space may be in the form of shared open space available to all residents and meeting the requirements of subsection (2)(b) of this section. Shared open space may be in the form of courtyards, front porches, patios, play areas gardens or similar spaces.

(ii) Ground Level Private Outdoor Space. One hundred percent of the required open space may be provided by ground level outdoor space that is adjacent and directly accessible to the subject unit. Such open spaces must be enclosed by a fence and/or hedge at least 32 inches in height to qualify. Ground level private open space in excess of minimum requirements must not be used in the calculations for determining the minimum useable open space requirements for other units in the development.

(iii) Balconies. Up to 50 percent of the required open space may be provided by private balconies provided they are at least 36 square feet with no dimension less than six feet. Individual balconies in excess of minimum requirements must not be used in the calculations for determining the minimum useable open space requirements for other units in the development.

(iv) Common Indoor Recreation Areas. Up to 50 percent of the required open space may be provided by common indoor recreation areas meeting the requirements of subsection (2)(c) of this section.

(v) Shared Roof Decks. For mixed use buildings, up to 100 percent of the required open space may be provided by shared roof decks located on the top of buildings which are available to all residents and meet the requirements of subsection (2)(d) of this section. Roof decks in mixed use buildings shall not be accessible to commercial tenants, employees, or customers.

(b) Shared Open Space. Shared open space can include landscaped courtyards or decks, entrance plazas, gardens with walkways, children’s play areas, pools, and water features provided they are accessible to all residents of the development. Accessible areas used for storm water retention or other multipurpose recreational and/or green spaces that meet the design criteria herein may qualify as shared open space.

Special requirements for common usable open spaces include the following:

(i) Shared open space must be located in centralized areas that are visible from units within the development.

(ii) Required setback areas must not count as shared open space unless the design of the space meets the standards herein.

(iii) Shared open space must feature no dimension less than 15 feet in order to provide functional leisure or recreational activity (unless otherwise noted herein).

(iv) Shared open space must feature paths or walkable lawns, landscaping, seating, lighting, and play structures, sports courts, or other pedestrian amenities to make the area more functional and enjoyable for a range of users.

(v) Shared open space must be separated from ground level windows, streets, service areas and parking lots with landscaping, fencing, and/or other acceptable treatments that enhance safety and privacy for both the shared open space and dwelling units.

(vi) When possible, the space should be oriented to receive sunlight, face east, west or preferably south.

(vii) Stairways and service elements located within or on the edge of shared open space must not be included in the open space calculations.

(viii) Shared porches may qualify as shared open space provided they are at least eight feet in depth and 96 square feet in total area.

(ix) The space must be accessible to all residents of the development.

(x) Natural, artificial, and stormwater ponds may be included in the shared open space. A maximum of 50 percent of the pond surface area, as measured when the pond is at its maximum designed depth, may be counted towards the minimum requirements of subsection (2)(a) of this section. Ponds must be integrated with trails and other features listed above to qualify as shared open space.

Figure 20.127.350(2)(b)(i) Shared Open Space Examples
[IMAGE]


The upper examples include a combination of open lawn area for informal recreation plus walkways and decorative landscape areas to enhance the setting for residents.
[IMAGE]


The left image above includes a covered gathering space with outdoor grills adjacent to a landscaped commons with a central walkway. The right image includes a pond/wetland type area with boardwalk and seating areas.

[IMAGE]


The above images show an acceptable example of using a pond as shared open space. Lawns, gentle slopes, and a perimeter walking path are integrated into this amenity.
[IMAGE]


The above image shows a stormwater pond that would not qualify as shared open space. The pond is fenced, inaccessible to users of the development, and it is lined by steep rocky banks.

(c) Indoor Recreational Areas. Such spaces must meet the following conditions:

(i) The space must be located in a visible area, such as near an entrance, lobby, or high traffic corridors.

(ii) Space must be designed specifically to serve interior recreational functions and not merely be leftover unrentable space used to meet the open space requirement. Such space must include amenities and design elements that will encourage use by residents.

(d) Shared Rooftop Decks. Such spaces must meet the following requirements:

(i) Space must feature hard surfacing and provide amenities such as seating areas, landscaping, and/or other features that encourage use.

(ii) Space must integrate landscaping elements that enhance the character of the space and encourage its use.

(iii) Space must incorporate features that provide for the safety of residents, such as enclosures, railings, and appropriate lighting levels.

Figure 20.127.350(2)(d) Rooftop Deck Examples
[IMAGE]


(3) Usable Commercial Open Space. New developments with nonresidential uses (except for development within the employment – industrial/office zone) on sites with a total site area greater than one-half acre must provide open space equal to at least two percent of the gross square footage of the development. The open space may be in the form of pedestrian-oriented space per subsection (4) of this section, garden, play area or other open space feature that serves both as a visual amenity and a place for human activity. Portions of sidewalks that are wider than 12 feet and which meet the standards of pedestrian-oriented space may be counted toward this requirement. For this specific standard, “site area” includes all land needed for the nonresidential portion of the project including parking, service areas, access and required landscaping. Nonresidential open space features must be approved by the reviewing authority.

Departure: Open space area may be reduced to one percent of the development envelope if the reviewing authority finds the project includes exceptional design features and elements that meet the purpose of the standards. This includes open spaces that feature a combination of design (site materials, amenities, and configuration) and location/context that clearly exceed typical plaza designs found in the region.

Figure 20.127.350(3) Example Site Development Integrating Usable Commercial Open Space
[IMAGE]


(4) Pedestrian-Oriented Space Design Criteria. This subsection describes the requirements and desired characteristics of pedestrian-oriented space (which may be used to meet the requirements of subsection (3) of this section).

(a) Required Pedestrian-Oriented Space Features.

(i) Visual and pedestrian access into the site from a street, private access road, or publicly accessible parking area.

(ii) Paved walking surfaces of either concrete or approved unit paving.

(iii) The spaces must be located in or adjacent to areas with significant pedestrian traffic to provide interest and security, such as adjacent to or visible from a building entry.

(iv) At least two linear feet of seating area (a bench or ledge at least 16 inches deep and appropriate seating height) or one individual seat per 60 square feet of plaza area or open space.

(v) Landscaping components that add visual interest and are not a visual barrier. This could include planting beds, raised planters, and/or potted plants.

(b) Desirable Pedestrian-Oriented Space Features.

(i) Pedestrian amenities, such as site furniture, lighting, artwork, drinking fountains, shade structures or other similar features.

(ii) Adjacent buildings with transparent windows and doors covering at least 50 percent of the facade between 30 inches and 10 feet above the ground level.

(iii) Pedestrian weather protection, alcoves, seating, or other features along building edges to allow for outdoor gathering.

(iv) Concrete or unit paving.

(c) Features Prohibited within a Pedestrian-Oriented Space.

(i) Asphalt pavement.

(ii) Adjacent service areas (e.g., trash areas) that are not separated with landscaping, as required in POMC 20.127.360, Location and design of service areas and mechanical equipment.

(iii) Adjacent chain-link fences.

(iv) Adjacent “blank walls” without “blank wall treatment” (see POMC 20.127.460(3)).

(v) Outdoor storage.

[IMAGE]


A covered outdoor gathering space (left) may be used to meet pedestrian-oriented space requirements. In the right image, the widened sidewalk area may be counted as pedestrian-oriented space.

(5) Useable Mixed Use Open Space. Developments with a mix of residential and nonresidential uses may double-count useable open space for both residential units and commercial square footage, provided the double-counted open space meets the requirements of both subsections (2) and (3) of this section. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.360 Location and design of service areas and mechanical equipment.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To minimize adverse visual, odor, and noise impacts of mechanical equipment, utility cabinets and service areas at ground and roof levels.

(b) To provide adequate, durable, well-maintained, and accessible service and equipment areas.

(c) To protect residential uses and adjacent properties from impacts due to location and utilization of service areas.

(2) Location of Ground Related Service Areas and Mechanical Equipment.

(a) Service areas (loading docks, trash dumpsters, compactors, recycling areas, electrical panels, and mechanical equipment areas) must be located for convenient service access while avoiding negative visual, auditory, olfactory, or physical impacts on the streetscape environment and adjacent residentially zoned properties. Service areas must be sited for alley access if available.

The director and/or hearing examiner may require evidence that such elements will not significantly impact neighboring properties or public areas. (For example, noise damping specifications may be required for fans located near residential zones.)

(b) Exterior Loading Areas. Exterior loading areas for commercial uses must not be located within 20 feet of a single-family residentially zoned property.

Departure opportunity: Exterior commercial loading areas are exempt from this standard if the reviewing authority finds such a restriction does not allow feasible development and alternative design measures can successfully mitigate potential negative impacts. For example, areas and drives may be required to be separated from the residential lot by a masonry wall at least eight feet high.

(c) Service areas must not be visible from the sidewalk and adjacent properties. Where the reviewing authority finds that the only option for locating a service area is an area visible from a public right-of-way, resident/customer parking area, internal walkway or pedestrian area, or from an adjacent property, the area must be screened with structural and landscaping screening measures provided in subsection (3) of this section and Chapter 20.128 POMC, Development Standards – Landscaping.

Departure opportunity: Service elements accessible from an alley are exempt from screening requirements.

(d) Design for Safety. Other provisions of this section notwithstanding, service areas used by residents must be located to avoid entrapment areas and other conditions where personal security is potentially a problem. Pedestrian-scaled lighting or other measures may be required to enhance security.

(e) Locate and shield noise-producing mechanical equipment, such as fans, heat pumps, etc., to minimize sounds and reduce impacts to adjacent residentially zoned properties.

Figure 20.127.360(2) Service Element Location
[IMAGE]


Locate service elements to reduce impacts on the residential and pedestrian environment, and provide appropriate enclosure.

(3) Screening of Ground Related Service Areas and Mechanical Equipment.

(a) Where screening of ground level service areas is called for (see subsection (2) of this section), adhere to the following:

(i) A structural enclosure must be constructed of masonry, heavy-gauge metal, or decay-resistant material that is also used with the architecture of the main building. The reviewing authority may allow materials other than those used for the main building if the finishes are similar in color and texture or if the proposed enclosure materials are more durable than those for the main structure. The walls must be sufficient to provide full screening from the affected roadway, pedestrian areas or adjacent use. The enclosure may use overlapping walls to screen dumpsters and other materials (see Figure 20.127.360(3) below).

(ii) Gates must be made of heavy-gauge, site-obscuring material. Chain link or chain link with slats is not an acceptable material for enclosures or gates.

(iii) Where the inside of service enclosures are visible from surrounding streets, walkways, and buildings, an opaque or semi-opaque horizontal cover or screen must be used to mitigate unsightly views. The horizontal screen/cover should be integrated into the enclosure design and compatible with adjacent development.

(iv) Collection points must be located and configured so that the enclosure gate swing does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or does not require that a hauling truck project into any public right-of-way. Ensure that screening elements allow for efficient service delivery and removal operations.

(v) The service area must be paved.

(b) The sides and rear of service enclosures must be screened with landscaping at least five feet wide in locations visible from the street, parking lots, and walkways to soften views of the screening element and add visual interest.

Departures from the provisions of subsections (3)(a) and (b) of this section will be considered provided the enclosure and landscaping treatment meet the purpose of the standards and add visual interest to site users.

Figure 20.127.360(3) Acceptable Screening Enclosure
[IMAGE]


All three examples use durable and attractive enclosures with trees and shrubs to soften views of the enclosures from the side. The lower left example uses a trellis structure on top – a desirable example particularly where the top of the enclosures are visible from surrounding buildings, streets, and walkways (due to topography or building heights).
[IMAGE]


(4) Utility Meters, Electrical Conduit, and Other Service Utility Apparatus.

(a) These elements must be located and/or designed to minimize their visibility to the public. Project designers are strongly encouraged to coordinate with applicable service providers early in the design process to determine the best approach in meeting these standards. If such elements are mounted in a location visible from the street, pedestrian walkway, shared open space, or shared auto courtyards, they must be screened with vegetation and/or integrated into the building’s architecture.

Figure 20.127.360(4) Utility Meter Location and Screening – Good and Bad Examples
[IMAGE]


Place utility meters in less visible locations. The upper and lower left examples are successfully tucked away in a less visible location and/or screened by vegetation. The right images are poorly executed and would not be permitted in such visible locations. Such meters must be coordinated and better integrated with the architecture of the building.
[IMAGE]


(5) Location and Screening of Roof-Mounted Mechanical Equipment.

(a) All rooftop mechanical equipment, including air conditioners, heaters, vents, and similar equipment must be fully screened from public view both at grade and from higher buildings with the exception of solar panels and roof-mounted wind turbines. Screening must be located so as not to interfere with operation of the equipment.

(b) For rooftop equipment, all screening devices must be well integrated into the architectural design through such elements as parapet walls, false roofs, roof wells, clerestories, or equipment rooms. Screening walls or unit-mounted screening is allowed but less desirable. Wood must not be used for screens or enclosures. Louvered designs are acceptable if consistent with building design style. Perforated metal is not permitted.

(c) The screening materials must be of material requiring minimal maintenance, and must be as high as the equipment being screened.

(d) Locate and shield noise-producing mechanical equipment, such as fans, heat pumps, etc., to minimize sounds and reduce impacts to adjacent residentially zoned properties.

Figure 20.127.360(5) Examples of How to Screen Roof-Mounted Mechanical Equipment
[IMAGE]


The examples above use walls to screen rooftop mechanical equipment from view from the street.

(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

Article IV. Building Design Standards


20.127.400 Purpose.

See the individual “purpose” statements for each section in this article. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.410 Applicability and compliance.

(1) See POMC 20.127.020(1) for clarification on the types of development to which these standards apply.

(2) See POMC 20.127.020(2) for the relationship between the provisions in this article and other documents and codes.

(3) See POMC 20.127.020(3) for the application of building additions and remodels and site improvements. (Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.420 Building character.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To promote buildings with an architectural character that reflects the region’s aesthetic and is based on human scaled design details, durable high quality materials, sustainable design measures, and respond uniquely to the site’s context.

(b) To emphasize that high quality design is most critical to Port Orchard’s high visibility sites and corridors.

(c) To avoid generic, corporate architectural design that degrades the character and identity of Port Orchard.

(2) Corporate Architecture.

(a) Architecture that is defined predominately by corporate identity features and is difficult to adapt to other uses is prohibited. For example, some franchise convenience uses have very specific architectural features (such as a distinctive roofline design that functions as a sign) that reinforce their identity. As tenants change in these types of buildings, these corporate identity features can negatively impact the character of the area and identity of new tenants. These features can also be very expensive to reconfigure and adapt to new uses.

(b) Exemptions. This prohibition does not apply the Bravo Terrace and Sedgwick Road areas identified in Figure 20.127.420.

Figure 20.127.420 Areas Exempt from the Prohibition of Corporate Architecture
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.430 Building massing and articulation.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To employ facade articulation techniques that reduce the perceived scale of large buildings and add visual interest from all observable scales.

(b) To create clear and welcoming building entries.

(2) Facade Articulation – Nonresidential. Storefronts and other buildings with nonresidential uses on the ground level facade must include articulation features every 40 feet (maximum) to create a pattern of small storefronts. At least three of the following features must be employed at intervals no greater than 40 feet:

(a) Window patterns and/or entries.

(b) Use of weather protection features.

(c) Use of vertical piers/columns.

(d) Change in roofline per subsection (6) of this section.

(e) Change in building material or siding style.

(f) Other design techniques that effectively reinforce a pattern of small storefronts compatible with the building’s surrounding context.

Other features that could be used to meet the standards on block frontages that are not designated as storefront.

(g) Vertical elements such as a trellis with plants, green wall, art element.

(h) Providing vertical building modulation of at least 12 inches in depth if tied to a change in roofline per subsection (6) of this section or a change in building material, siding style, or color.

Departure: Other articulation features may be used provided they meet the purpose of the standards and the design criteria set forth in subsection (4) of this section.

Figure 20.127.430(2) Facade Articulation Examples
[IMAGE]


The left image uses window patterns, weather protection elements, and roofline modulation. The photo example to the right also includes window patterns and weather protection along with a change in masonry texture and color to articulate the facade. The lower example illustrates how a multitenant retail building can successfully be articulated (windows, weather protection, vertical building modulation, and roofline changes).
[IMAGE]


(3) Facade Articulation – Residential. Residential buildings must include articulation features at intervals that relate to the location/size of individual units within the building (or no more than every 30 feet) to break up the massing of the building and add visual interest and compatibility to the surrounding context. At least three of the following features must be employed at intervals no greater than the unit interval or 30 feet (whichever is less):

(a) Use of windows and/or entries.

(b) Change in roofline per subsection (6) of this section.

(c) Change in building material, siding style, and/or window pattern.

(d) Providing vertical building modulation of at least 12 inches in depth if tied to a change in roofline modulation per subsection (6) of this section or a change in building material, siding style, or color. Balconies may be used to qualify for this option if they are recessed or projected from the facade by at least 18 inches. Juliet balconies or other balconies that appear to be tacked on to the facade will not qualify for this option unless they employ high quality materials and effectively meet the purpose of the standards.

(e) Vertical elements such as a trellis with plants, green wall, art element.

(f) Other design techniques that effectively break up the massing at no more than 30-foot intervals.

Departures: Other articulation features will be considered provided they meet the purpose of the standards and the design criteria set forth in subsection (4) of this section.

(4) Departure Criteria Associated with Articulation Standards. Proposals must meet the purpose of the standards. The following criteria will be considered in determining whether the proposed articulation treatment meets the “purpose.”

(a) Consider the type and width of the proposed articulation treatment and how effective it is in meeting the purpose given the building’s current and desired context (per Port Orchard’s comprehensive plan or applicable adopted subarea plan).

(b) Consider the applicable block frontage designation. Undesignated block frontages warrant more flexibility than block frontages designated as varied or landscaped. 

(c) Consider the size and width of the building. Smaller buildings warrant greater flexibility than larger buildings.

(d) Consider the quality of facade materials in concert with doors, windows, and other facade features and their ability to add visual interest to the street from a pedestrian scale and more distant observable scales.

Figure 20.127.430(4) Facade Articulation Departure Examples
[IMAGE]


This building would be a good departure example. Its two clear articulation features are the window patterns and the entry/building modulation feature (three minimum are required). However, the overall effectiveness of these articulation features combined with the high quality of materials and detailing and the relatively small width of the building help it meet the purpose of the standards.

(5) Maximum Facade Width. For most buildings, small scale articulation techniques (see subsections (2) and (3) of this section) are sufficient to reduce the perceived scale of buildings, add visual interest, and contribute to the pedestrian environment. Larger buildings need more substantial articulated/modulated features to break up the massing and add visual interest.

Building facades wider than 100 feet must include at least one of the following features to break up the massing of the building and add visual interest. Building walls facing alleys, rear or side yards are not subject to the standards herein, except for zone edge properties, when adjacent to a lower intensity zoning district.

(a) Provide vertical building modulation at least 20 feet deep and 30 feet wide. For multi-story buildings, the modulation must extend through more than one-half of the building floors.

(b) Use of a contrasting vertical modulated design component featuring all of the following:

(i) Component extends through all floors above the first floor fronting on the street. Exception: upper floors that are set back more than 10 feet horizontally from the facade are exempt.

(ii) Utilizes a change in building materials that effectively contrasts with the rest of the facade.

(iii) Component is modulated vertically from the rest of the facade by an average of six inches.

(iv) Component is designed to provide roofline modulation per subsection (6) of this section.

(c) Facade employs building walls with contrasting articulation that make it appear like two distinct buildings. To qualify for this option, these contrasting facades must employ all of the following:

(i) Different building materials and/or configuration of building materials.

(ii) Contrasting window design (sizes or configurations).

(d) Departures will be considered provided the design meets the purpose of the standards. Supplemental consideration for approving alternative designs:

(i) Width of the Facade. The larger the facade, the more substantial articulation/ modulation features need to be.

(ii) Block Frontage Designation. Storefront designated block frontages warrant the most scrutiny while undesignated streets warrant more flexibility.

(iii) The type of articulation treatment and how effective it is in meeting the purpose given the building’s context.

Figure 20.127.430(5)(i) Illustrating Maximum Facade Width Standards
[IMAGE]


Less than 100 feet wide: meets standard.                More than 100 feet wide: does not meet standard.


[IMAGE]
Building incorporates a 20-foot by 30-foot courtyard along the facade to effectively break it up into smaller components: meets standard.

Figure 20.127.430(5)(ii) Facade Width Good and Bad Examples
[IMAGE]


Both buildings use modulated entry features to help break up the perceived massing and add visual interest.
[IMAGE]


The left building (about 110 feet wide) uses an articulated partial third floor along with smaller articulation treatments on the main floors to effectively break up the perceived scale and add visual interest (this would be a good departure example). The building to the right would not be an acceptable example. While the articulated features on the lower floors help, the monotony of the very long upper floor and roofline would not be acceptable.

(6) Roofline Modulation. In order to qualify as a facade articulation feature in subsections (2), (3), and (5) of this section, rooflines must employ one or more of the following:

(a) For flat roofs or facades with horizontal eave, fascia, or parapet, the minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation is the greater of two feet or 0.1 multiplied by the wall height (finish grade to top of the wall) when combined with vertical building modulation techniques described in subsections above. Otherwise, the minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation is the greater of four feet or 0.2 multiplied by the wall height.

(b) A pitched roofline or gabled roofline segment of at least 20 feet in width. Buildings with pitched roofs must include a minimum slope of 5:12 and feature modulated roofline components at the interval required per the applicable standard above.

(c) A combination of the above.

Departures: Other designs will be considered provided the roofline modulation design effectively reduces the perceived scale of the building and adds visual interest.

The bottom left building illustrates a pitched roof example and the bottom right building includes a combination of flat and gabled rooflines.

(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.440 Building details.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To encourage the incorporation of design details and small scale elements into building facades that are attractive at a pedestrian scale.

(b) To integrate window design that adds depth, richness, and visual interest to the facade.

(2) Facade Details – Nonresidential and Mixed Use Buildings. All commercial and mixed use buildings must be enhanced with appropriate details. All new buildings and additions associated with Level II and III improvements (see POMC 20.127.020) must employ at least one detail element from each of the three categories below for each facade articulation interval (see POMC 20.127.430). 

For example, a building with 120 feet of street frontage with a facade articulated at 40-foot intervals will need to meet the standards for each of the three facade segments below.

(a) At least one window and/or entry treatment, such as the following, must be employed for each articulation interval:

(i) Display windows divided into a grid of multiple panes.

(ii) Transom windows.

(iii) Roll-up windows/doors.

(iv) Other distinctive window treatment that meets the purpose of the standards.

(v) Recessed entry.

(vi) Decorative door.

(vii) Other decorative or specially designed entry treatment that meets the purpose of the standards.

[IMAGE]

[IMAGE]


Examples of decorative or specially designed windows and entries. A = openable storefront window. B = transom windows. C = openable window with decorative details. D = decorative window shades. E = decorative door. F = recessed entry.

(b) At least one building element or facade detail, such as the following, must be employed for each articulation interval:

(i) Custom-designed weather protection element such as a steel canopy, cloth awning, or retractable awning.

(ii) Decorative building-mounted light fixtures.

(iii) Bay windows, trellises, towers, and similar elements.

(iv) Decorative, custom hanging sign(s) (option only available for building remodels).

(v) Other details or elements that meet the purpose of these standards.

Figure 20.127.440(2)(b) 
[IMAGE]
Examples of Attached Elements That Enhance the Visual Intrigue of the Building

Examples of elements attached to facade that enhance the visual intrigue of the building. A = retractable awning. B = custom hanging bike rack and repair station integrated as a storefront design element. C = decorative facade/sign lighting. D and E = custom decorative canopy. F = decorative tower.

(c) At least one building material and other facade element, such as the following, must be employed for each articulation interval:

(i) Use of decorative building materials/use of building materials. Examples include decorative use of brick, tile, or stonework.

(ii) Artwork on building, such as a mural or bas-relief sculpture.

(iii) Decorative kick-plate, pilaster, base panel, or other similar feature.

(iv) Hand-crafted material, such as special wrought iron or carved wood.

(v) Other details that meet the purpose of the standards.

“Custom,” “decorative,” or “hand-crafted” elements referenced above must be distinctive or “one-of-a-kind” elements or unusual designs that require a high level of craftsmanship.

Departures will be considered provided the facade (at the overall scale and at the individual articulation scale) meets the purpose of the standards above.

[IMAGE]


Examples of decorative surface materials. A = decorative brick/design. B = decorative tile-work and column pattern. C = decorative medallion.
[IMAGE]


D = decorative mosaic tile work. E = decorative bulkhead. F = decorative materials and design.

 (3) Window Design Standards. All windows (except storefront display windows) must employ designs that add depth and richness to the facade. At least one of the following features must be included to meet this requirement:

(a) Recess windows at least two inches from the facade.

(b) Incorporate window trim (at least three inches wide) around windows.

(c) Incorporate other design treatments that add depth, richness, and visual interest to the facade.

Departures from the window standards above will be considered provided the design meets the purpose of the standards.

Figure 20.127.440(3) Acceptable and Unacceptable Window Design Examples
[IMAGE]


Recessed and/or trimmed windows above.


[IMAGE]
The window in the left image lacks any other detail that adds visual interest. However, the right example, with its prominent black sash and muntins and frieze/apron details above and below the windows would be acceptable departure design.
[IMAGE]


(4) Cornice/Roofline Design for Flat Roofs. Nonresidential and mixed use buildings employing a flat roof must employ a distinctive roofline that effectively provides an identifiable “top” to the building, including one of the following (Figure 20.127.440(4) below illustrates acceptable and unacceptable examples): 

(a) A traditional cornice line or a contemporary interpretation of a traditional cornice line. Such rooflines must be proportional to the size and scale of the building. 

(b) Understated cornice lines are permitted depending on the materials and design of the base and middle elements in reinforcing the base/middle/top configuration.

Rooftop solar units are permitted, provided the placement and design of units visible from the surrounding streetscape are carefully integrated into the overall design concept of the building.

Departure: Alternative roofline designs may be acceptable provided the building design, collectively, meets the purpose of the standards. For example, adding additional articulation treatments and/or detailing may help the building meet the departure criteria.

Figure 20.127.440(4) Examples of Buildings Employing Confident and Distinctive Rooflines
[IMAGE]


Building 1 uses a dramatic overhanging cornice at the corner. The left portion of building 1 uses a very simple cornice line – to go with the upper level setback. Building 2 uses a traditional cornice line.
[IMAGE]


Building 3 uses capped projecting columns along with an understated cornice line. Building 4 uses a very simple roofline – which is acceptable in this case due to the prominence of the wooden canopy.

(5) Articulated Building Entries. The primary building entrance for an office building, hotel, apartment building, public or community-based facility or other multi-story commercial building must be designed as a clearly defined and demarcated standout architectural feature of the building. Such entrances must be easily distinguishable from regular storefront entrances on the building. Such entries must be scaled proportional to the building. See Figure 20.127.440(5) below for good examples.

Figure 20.127.440(5) Acceptable Building Entry Examples
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.450 Building materials.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To encourage the use of durable, high quality, and urban building materials that minimize maintenance cost and provide visual interest from all observable vantage points.

(b) To promote the use of a distinctive mix of materials that helps to articulate facades and lends a sense of depth and richness to the buildings.

(c) To place the highest priority on the first floor in the quality and detailing of materials at the pedestrian scale.

(2) Quality Building Materials. Applicants must use high quality durable materials. This is most important for the base of buildings, particularly for commercial and mixed use buildings where the facade is sited close to sidewalks. At a minimum, stone, brick or tile masonry, or architectural concrete (first two feet only) must be used (excluding window and door areas) for the first floor of cladding on nonresidential or mixed use buildings and the first two feet of residential buildings.

(3) Special Conditions and Limitations for Concrete Block (Also Known as Concrete Masonry Unit or CMU). Concrete block may be used as a cladding material if it is incorporated with other permitted materials and/or incorporates a combination of textures and/or colors to add visual interest. For example, combining split or rock-facade units with smooth blocks can create distinctive patterns. The figure below illustrates acceptable concrete block use/designs.

Figure 20.127.450(3) Acceptable Concrete Block Use/Design
[IMAGE]


CMU is the primary cladding for the corner element above, but secondary to brick on the main facades. The corner element uses a combination of decorative split-faced CMU closer to the sidewalk and smooth-faced CMU that is colored to look more like traditional white terra cotta tiles.
[IMAGE]


The above facade illustrates an acceptable alternative example, as CMU is used as the primary cladding material. Note the use of split-facade CMUs above each of the awnings and coupled with the use of smooth-facade CMUs on the vertical columns (which employ black accent tiles for added interest).

(4) Special Conditions and Limitations for Metal Siding. Metal siding may be used as a secondary cladding material if it is incorporated with other permitted materials and complies with the following standards:

(a) It must feature visible corner molding and trim and must not extend lower than two feet above grade. Masonry, concrete, or other durable material must be incorporated between the metal siding and the ground plane.

(b) Metal siding must be factory finished with a matte, nonreflective surface.

(c) Use of at least two colors of metal siding on the facade is encouraged but not required.

Departures: Other designs will be considered provided the material’s integration and overall facade composition meets the purpose of the standards.

Figure 20.127.450(4) Acceptable Metal Siding Examples
[IMAGE]


The use of metal siding in each example above is secondary to masonry. The left and right images are more contemporary in character, whereas the middle image is more rustic and industrial, with more refined windows.

(5) Special Conditions and Limitations for the Use of Exterior Insulation and Finish System (EIFS). Such material/finishes may be used as a decorative accent cladding material if incorporated with other permitted materials and compliant with the following:

(a) EIFS is limited to no more than 20 percent of the total facade area and may not be the primary cladding material.

(b) EIFS must feature a smooth or sand finish only.

(c) EIFS must be trimmed in wood, masonry, or other material and must be sheltered from weather by roof overhangs or other methods.

(d) EIFS must not extend lower than eight feet above grade. Concrete, masonry, or other durable material must be used for ground level wall surfaces to provide a durable surface where damage is most likely.

Departures to allow up to 50 percent coverage of the facade and other design treatments will be considered provided the material’s integration and overall facade composition meets the purpose of the standards.

Figure 20.127.450(5) Acceptable and Unacceptable EIFS Examples
[IMAGE]


Note the use of brick and decorative concrete block on the ground level and EIFS on the second floor of the left image. The window treatments visible on the second floor add depth and interest to the facade. The right image employs EIFS between the window and sidewalk – this design is prohibited.

(6) Special Conditions and Limitations for Cementitious Wall Board Paneling/Siding. Such material may be used provided it meets the following provisions:

(a) Cement board paneling/siding may not be used on the ground floor of nonresidential or mixed use buildings where adjacent to a sidewalk or other pedestrian path.

(b) Where cement board paneling/siding is the dominant siding material, the design must integrate a mix of colors and/or textures that are articulated consistent with windows, balconies, and modulated building surfaces and are balanced with facade details that add visual interest from the ground level and adjacent buildings.

Departures: Other designs will be considered provided the material’s integration and overall facade composition meets the purpose of the standards.

Figure 20.127.450(6) Acceptable and Unacceptable Cementitious Wall Board Examples.
[IMAGE]


The above building uses cementitious wall board in different textures and colors to help articulate the facade. The white color replicates the board and batten style in the left image and green color in the right image effectively replicates horizontal wood siding.
[IMAGE]


The wall board panels covering a large area in a single color would not meet the purpose of the standards. The right image is a better example and combines larger panels (dark maroon color) with horizontal wall board siding (beige color) as effective articulation features. Below is a similar acceptable example.


[IMAGE]


Another acceptable wall board example replicating board and batten style with horizontal siding integrated with different colors and roofline modulation.

(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.127.460 Blank wall treatments.

(1) Purpose.

(a) To avoid untreated blank walls.

(b) To retain and enhance the character of Port Orchard’s streetscapes.

(2) Blank Wall Definition. A wall (including building facades and retaining walls) is considered a blank wall if it is over 10 feet in height, has a horizontal length greater than 15 feet, and does not include a transparent window or door.

Figure 20.127.460(2) Blank Wall Definition
[IMAGE]


(3) Untreated blank walls visible from a public street, pedestrian-oriented space, common usable open space, or pedestrian walkway are prohibited. Methods to treat blank walls can include:

(a) Display windows at least 16 inches of depth to allow for changeable displays. Tack on display cases do not qualify as a blank wall treatment.

(b) Landscape planting bed at least five feet wide or a raised planter bed at least two feet high and three feet wide in front of the wall with planting materials that are sufficient to obscure or screen at least 60 percent of the wall’s surface within three years.

(c) Installing a vertical trellis in front of the wall with climbing vines or plant materials.

(d) Installing a mural as approved by the reviewing authority.

(e) Special building detailing that adds visual interest at a pedestrian scale. Such detailing must use a variety of surfaces; monotonous designs will not meet the purpose of the standards. 

For large visible blank walls, a variety of treatments may be required to meet the purpose of the standards.

Figure 20.127.460(3) Acceptable and Unacceptable Blank Wall Treatments
[IMAGE]


The left image illustrates that heavy landscaping can be very effective in treating a large blank wall. The building in the middle image uses a combination of planted trellises and display ads integrated with the building’s architecture along a facade facing a drive-through. The example in the right image simply doesn’t use enough treatments and the result is a stark and unwelcome streetscape.

(Ord. 008-18 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

20.128.050 Plant material and installation standards.

(1) Native Plant Species. New landscaping materials shall include species native to the region or hardy, waterwise, and noninvasive species appropriate in the climatic conditions of the region (decorative annuals are an exception). Generally acceptable plant materials must be those identified as hardy in Zone 8b as described in United States 

Department of Agriculture’s Plant Hardiness Zone Map. The selection of plant species should include consideration of soil type and depth, the amount of maintenance required, spacing, exposure to sun and wind, the slope and contours of the site, compatibility with existing native vegetation preserved on the site, water conservation where needed, and the impact of landscaping on visibility of the site for purposes of public safety and surveillance.

(2) Tree Standards and Guidelines.

(iii) Required trees of any species within parking areas shall be a minimum caliper of one-and-one-half inches (as measured 24 inches above the root ball) and a minimum height of 10 feet at the time of planting.

(3) Shrub Standard. Shrubs, except for ornamental grasses, shall be a minimum of one-gallon size at the time of planting.

(4) Ground Cover Standards and Guidelines.

(a) Ground covers shall be planted and spaced to result in total coverage of the required landscape area within three years as follows, or as per recommendations by Washington State licensed landscape architect, Washington-certified professional horticulturalist (CPH), or other qualified individual. Ground cover plants other than turf forming grasses must be planted in triangular spacing at the following rates:

(i) Four-inch pots at 18 inches on center.

(ii) One gallon or greater sized containers at 24 inches on center.

(iii) Alternative plant spacing may be appropriate depending on the specific plants. When applicable, plant spacing information must be included with permit application submittals from published sources, such as the Sunset Western Garden Book, from Internet sources, or from cut sheets provided by a nursery. Such sources must be identified for verification purposes.

(b) Grass is acceptable as ground cover in landscaped areas, but generally not preferred for water conservation and maintenance purposes (lawn areas designed as play areas are an exception).

(c) Ground cover areas shall contain at least two inches of composted organic material at finished grade.

(5) Tree and Plant Diversity.

(a) If there are more than eight required trees, no more than 40 percent of them may be of one species.

(6) Soil Augmentation and Mulching.

(a) Existing soils shall be augmented with a two-inch layer of fully composted organic material tilled a minimum of six inches deep prior to initial planting.

(b) Landscape areas shall be covered with at least two inches of mulch to minimize evaporation. Mulch shall consist of organic materials such as bark chips and wood grindings or yard waste, sawdust, and/or manure that is fully composted. Washed rock may also be used as a mulch.

(7) Landscape Installation Standards.

(a) All required landscaping shall be in-ground, except when in raised planters. Plant materials shall be installed to current nursery industry standards.

(b) Plant materials shall be properly supported to ensure survival. Support devices such as guy wires or stakes shall not interfere with vehicular or pedestrian movement. Where support is necessary, stakes, guy wires or other measures shall be removed as soon as the plant can support itself.

(c) Existing trees and plant materials to be retained shall be protected during construction. Protection measures may include silt fencing, chain link fencing, or other sturdy fencing placed at the dripline of trees to be retained. Grading, topsoil storage, construction material storage, vehicles, and equipment shall not be allowed within the dripline of trees to be retained.

(d) Installation of landscaping materials must take into consideration access to utility vaults, pedestals, and other public and private utility facilities.

(e) Trees and major shrubs at mature size should avoid interference with windows, decks, pedestrian walkways or other travelled ways, or lighting. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.128.060 Landscaping types.

(1) Type A Landscaping.

(a) Type A landscaping shall function as a full screen and visual barrier. This landscaping is typically found between residential and nonresidential areas and used to screen unwanted views.

(b) Type A landscaping shall minimally consist of:

(i) Trees. Predominately evergreen (more than 50 percent) at the following rates on landscape strips:

(A) One large tree per 300 square feet or 30 linear feet.

(B) One medium tree per 220 square feet or 22 linear feet.

(C) One small tree per 150 square feet or 15 linear feet.

At least 70 percent of the trees shall be large.

(ii) Shrubs. Predominately evergreen provided at a rate of one shrub per four linear feet of landscaped strip and spaced no more than eight feet on center.

(iii) Plant Diversity. Trees and shrubs must comply with POMC 20.128.050(5).

(iv) Ground Cover. Planted at a density to cover the landscape buffer per POMC 20.128.070 within three years.

(v) The selected plant materials and configuration will be able to screen 70 percent of the unwanted views within five years of planting and fully screen the unwanted view within six years. This requirement will account for the size of materials planted and their typical growth rate.

(2) Type B Landscaping.

(a) Type B landscaping is a “filtered screen” that functions as a visual separator. This landscaping is typically found between differing types of residential development and used to screen unwanted views from the pedestrian environment.

(b) Type B landscaping shall minimally consist of:

(i) Trees. At least 50 percent deciduous trees and at least 30 percent evergreen trees at the following rates on landscape strips:

(A) One large tree per 300 square feet or 30 linear feet.

(B) One medium tree per 220 square feet or 22 linear feet.

(C) One small tree per 150 square feet or 15 linear feet.

At least 70 percent of the trees shall be large.

(ii) Shrubs. Provided at the rate of one shrub per four linear feet of landscaped strip and spaced no more than eight feet on center.

(iii) Plant Diversity. Trees and shrubs must comply with POMC 20.128.050(5).

(iv) Ground Cover. Planted at a density to cover the landscape buffer per POMC 20.128.070 within three years.

(v) The selected plant materials and configuration will meet the purpose of the standards within five years of planting. This requirement will account for the size of materials and the growth rate.

(3) Type C Landscaping.

(a) Type C landscaping is a “see-through screen” that functions as a partial visual separator to soften the appearance of parking areas and building elevations. This landscaping is typically found along street frontages or between multifamily developments.

(b) Type C landscaping shall minimally consist of:

(i) Trees. At least 70 percent deciduous trees at the following rates on landscape strips:

(A) One large tree per 300 square feet or 30 linear feet.

(B) One medium tree per 220 square feet or 22 linear feet.

(C) One small tree per 150 square feet or 15 linear feet.

At least 70 percent of the trees shall be large.

(ii) Shrubs. Provided at the rate of one shrub per four linear feet of landscaped strip and spaced no more than eight feet on center.

(iii) Ground Cover. Planted at a density to cover the landscape buffer per POMC 20.128.070 within three years.

(iv) Plant Diversity. Trees and shrubs must comply with POMC 20.128.050(5).

(v) Tree and shrub placement shall be designed to maximize pedestrian visibility (generally between three and eight feet above grade once trees have matured).

(vi) The selected plant materials and configuration will meet the purpose of the standards within five years of planting. This requirement will account for the size of materials and the growth rate.

(c) Where Type C landscaping is designed to also function as a rain garden, adjustments in the spacing of trees, shrubs, and ground cover will be allowed provided the rain garden meets the function requirements of subsection (6) of this section and the intended function of Type C landscaping as defined in subsection (3)(a) of this section.

(4) Type D Landscaping.

(a) Type D landscaping refers to all other landscaped areas that do not qualify as Type A – C landscaping. While native and low maintenance trees and shrubs are encouraged in these areas, lawn areas may be used for recreational or design purposes. These areas may also include flower beds and perennial beds.

(b) Type D landscaping may include any combination of plant materials provided they comply with POMC 20.128.050.

(5) Low Hedge. A low hedge is intended to function as an attractive visual divider of space rather than a visual buffer between uses and properties. To qualify as a hedge landscaping type, the planting must be at least 30 inches wide and 30 inches tall. The hedge include plant materials that typically grow no taller than five feet at maturity or are maintained between 30 inches and 48 inches tall. Additional limits on hedges may be imposed by the public works director within required sight triangles at intersections. Shrubs or other hedge plant materials must be placed at a rate of one per four linear feet of landscaped strip or otherwise recommended for shrub species. Plant spacing information must be included with permit application submittals from published sources, such as the Sunset Western Garden Book, from Internet sources, or from cut sheets provided by the nursery.

(6) Rain Garden. A rain garden is a landscaped depression that collects, absorbs, and filters stormwater runoff from rooftops, driveways, patios, and other hard surfaces. They can also function as an attractive visual divider of space. To qualify as a rain garden, the following elements must be included:

(a) Garden located and designed to capture impervious area runoff.

(b) Six to 12 inches ponding depth.

(c) Twelve to 24 inches rain garden soil depth with two to three inches surface mulch layer.

(d) Gradual side slopes (maximum 2:1).

20.128.070 Landscape site design standards.

(1) Required Landscape Buffer Standards. Screening between certain uses may be called for in Table 20.128.070 below or elsewhere in this chapter:

(a) The provisions of this section do not apply to, and landscape buffers are not required for, development with a designated storefront block frontage (POMC 20.127.100 through 20.127.260) unless required as a condition of a permit (such as a conditional use permit or subdivision) or SEPA.

(b) Where mature trees and vegetation exist within the required buffer areas, the preservation of said mature trees and vegetation may be preferable to new plant materials. The director may require up to 50 percent additional buffer width and/or specific planting conditions to better ensure the survival of existing mature trees and/or augment existing plantings to meet the intent of the standards.

(c) The letters A, B, and C refer to the required landscape buffer type(s) (described in POMC 20.128.060). Where more than one buffer type is referenced at the intersection of the column and the row, only one of the listed buffer types is required.

(d) Where the cells at the intersection of the column and the row are empty, there are no landscaping buffer requirements for the particular situation.

(e) If a * appears after a use or term within the table, then the use or term is defined in Chapter 20.12 or 20.39 POMC.

(f) Where superscript numbers are included in a cell, see the corresponding note matching the number below the table.

(g) For the application of building additions, remodels and site improvements, the provisions of POMC 20.127.020(3) shall apply.

(h) Departures. Alternative buffer treatments may be approved per POMC 20.127.060 for any of the buffer types required below, provided they meet the purpose of this chapter.

(2) Street, Park, or Trail Buffers.

(a) For landscaping between uses or structures and streets, also see the applicable block frontage standards in POMC 20.127.100 through 20.127.260. Plant materials, installation, and maintenance are subject to the standards of this chapter.

(b) For nonresidential, single-family attached (three units or more), and multifamily development (three units or more), see POMC 20.127.220 for trail/park block frontage standards. Alternative designs will be considered based on the unique context of the site, the development, and the park/trail provided the designs promote safety for park/trail users, and mitigate any potential negative impacts of the proposed use on the park/trail.

(c) For storage yards, a minimum 10-foot wide planting strip with Type A landscaping is required between any street and such storage yard.

(3) Surface Parking Lot Landscaping.

(a) Parking Lot Perimeters.

(i) For parking lots abutting public right-of-way, use Type C landscaping at a width equal to or greater than the minimum building setback specified for the applicable block frontage type specified in POMC 20.127.100 through 20.127.260. For parking lots on sites without an applicable block frontage type, the parking lot landscape buffer shall be at least 10 feet deep.

(ii) For parking lots along internal private roadways in commercial areas, provide a planting strip at least six feet wide with Type C landscaping.

(iii) For parking lots along internal lot lines, use Type A or B landscaping at least 10 feet deep, except where a greater buffer width is required per the standards in Table 20.128.070.

Departures will be considered provided they meet the purpose of this chapter. Examples of acceptable departures may include decorative low walls with landscaping, decorative elevated planters, or landscaping with a trellis. In no case may landscaping buffers be less than five feet wide. The minimum height of planters or walls, where used, is three feet. The maximum height of walls where used shall be five feet.

(A) Type C landscaping shall be utilized for landscaping islands internal to parking lots.

(B) At least 75 percent of the required deciduous trees must be large trees. Medium and small trees are acceptable where overhead electric lines would interfere with normal growth.

(C) Rain gardens and swales may be integrated into required planting areas.

(iii) Landscaped Island Sizes. At a minimum, tree islands shall be a minimum of 256 square feet. Planting islands must be at least six feet deep and wide.

(iv) Landscaped Island Spacing. Parking bays shall be broken up with landscaped islands or medians to avoid long monotonous rows of parking. Tree islands shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking lot in order to provide an even tree canopy throughout the lot.

(v) Each parking space must be located within 75 feet of a tree measured from the closest point of the parking space to the tree trunk.

Departures will be considered provided they meet the purpose of this chapter.

(4) Foundation Planting. All street-facing elevations must have landscaping along any exposed foundation. The landscaped area may be along the outer edge of a porch instead of the foundation. This landscaping requirement does not apply to portions of the building facade that provide access for pedestrians or vehicles to the building. The foundation landscaping must meet the following standards:

(a) The landscaped area must be at least three feet wide.

(b) There must be at least one three-gallon shrub for every three lineal feet of foundation.

(c) Ground cover plants must fully cover the remainder of the landscaped area.

Foundation plantings would be required along this exposed concrete foundation.

(5) Existing Vegetation.

(a) Existing healthy, native, and noninvasive vegetation may be used to fulfill the requirements of this chapter.

(b) When existing vegetation is proposed to be used to fulfill the requirements of this chapter, that vegetation shall be shown on required landscape plans as “existing vegetation to be retained” and prior to land disturbing activities, these areas shall be flagged in the field and be protected by construction fencing. In the event that existing vegetation proposed to be used to fulfill the requirements of this chapter is altered, damaged, or removed during development or construction activity, this area shall be restored to its original state after the development or construction activity is complete, or, shall be replanted in accordance with a new revised landscaping plan developed and approved in accordance with this chapter.

(6) Stormwater Facilities.

(a) Plant-based stormwater treatment facilities such as rain gardens (see POMC 20.128.060(6)) and swales may be used to meet the requirements of this section as provided elsewhere in this chapter.

(b) Stormwater detention facilities such as ponds and collection basins may not be used to meet the requirements of this section unless designed per subsection (6)(a) of this section. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.128.080 Development within required buffers.

This section applies to buffers that are required per Table 20.128.070.

(1) Pedestrian walkways are allowed within buffers, subject to the following standards:

(a) Walkways shall not exceed five feet in width.

(b) Walkways shall cross buffers at an angle between 60 and 90 degrees.

(c) Walkways may only run along the length of a buffer if the buffer is at least 40 feet in width, and the walkway is located within the inner 25 percent of the buffer.

(2) Utilities are not permitted in buffers within a residential subdivision, unless no reasonable alternative exists. However, utilities may be installed in an easement that is located along street frontage and parallel to the street. If utilities are placed in a buffer, they shall be located and installed in a way that minimizes disturbance of the buffer area: not parallel, but crossing at an angle between 60 and 90 degrees. If stormwater drainage channels are placed in a buffer at an angle less than 60 degrees, the buffer width shall be increased by the width of the utility easement or disturbance, or at least 10 feet, whichever is greater. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.128.090 Irrigation standards.

The purpose of this standard is to ensure that plants will survive the critical establishment period when they are most vulnerable.

All required landscaped areas in the city must comply with at least one of the following:

(1) A permanent built-in irrigation system with an automatic controller will serve the proposed landscape area, and the system will be installed and operational before the city grants an occupancy permit or final inspection for the development.

(2) A temporary irrigation system will serve the proposed landscape area, provided the applicant can successfully demonstrate that the proposed temporary irrigation system will provide sufficient water to ensure that the plant materials to be planted will survive installation and, once established, will survive without watering other than natural rainfall.

(3) A permanent or temporary irrigation system will not serve the proposed landscape area, provided:

(a) The director finds the landscape area otherwise fulfills the requirements of this section; and

(b) The applicant submits all of the following with the site plan application:

(i) A statement from a Washington State licensed landscape architect, Washington-certified professional horticulturalist (CPH), or other qualified individual certifying that the materials to be planted will survive without watering other than natural rainfall.

(ii) A plan for monitoring the survival of required vegetation on the approved site plan for at least one year and for detection and replacement of required vegetation that does not survive with like-kind material or other material approved by the director.

(iii) A statement from the applicant agreeing to install an irrigation system if the director finds one is needed to ensure survival of required vegetation, based on the results of the monitoring plan. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.128.100 Maintenance of required buffers and landscaped areas.

(1) Maintenance Responsibility. The owners of the property and their agents, heirs, or assigns shall be responsible for the installation, preservation, and maintenance of all planting and physical features (installed or vegetated natural areas) required under this chapter. Damage to these areas shall result in the revegetation requirements or fines per Chapters 2.64 and 20.02 POMC.

(2) Inspections after Second and Fifth Year. The director shall inspect the site two and five years after the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy in order to ensure compliance with the approved landscape plan and to ensure that the landscaping is properly maintained. Failure to maintain required landscape areas on a permanent basis may result in fines according to Chapters 2.64 and 20.02 POMC.

(3) Maintenance Responsibility, Replacement of Damaged Vegetation, and Associated Fines.

(a) The owners of the property and their agents, heirs, or assigns must be responsible for maintaining all required landscaping and screening areas in a healthy, growing condition.

(b) All landscaping and screening areas must be maintained reasonably free of weeds and trash, must be treated for pest/diseases in accordance with the approved landscape plan, and must be maintained so as to prevent mulch, straw, dirt, or other materials from washing onto streets, sidewalks, and adjoining properties.

(c) Limbing up trees and “topping” or shearing off trees is prohibited, unless required for public safety reasons approved by the director.

(d) The property owner shall take actions to protect trees and landscaping from unnecessary damage during all facility and site maintenance operations.

(e) Any dead, unhealthy, or missing vegetation, or vegetation disfigured by severe or excessive pruning, unusual weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, or other natural occurrence such as damage by wild or domestic animals, must be replaced with equivalent vegetation that conforms to the plant materials and installation standards in POMC 20.128.050, other applicable standards of this title, and the approved site plan.

(f) The owner shall have one growing season to replace or replant after receiving notice from the director. The director shall consider the type and location of the required vegetation area in making a determination on the extent of replanting requirements.

(g) Failure to maintain all plantings in accordance with this section shall constitute a violation of the Port Orchard Municipal Code and may result in fines in accordance with Chapter 20.02 POMC.

(4) Landscape Maintenance Plan. The paragraph and list below regarding a landscape maintenance/management plan shall be placed on the landscape plan prior to plan approval, along with any other notes applicable to site landscaping. This statement may be individualized based on the specific characteristics of each site and its landscaping plan requirements. The maintenance plan shall be prepared by a Washington State licensed landscape architect, Washington-certified professional horticulturalist (CPH), or other qualified individual.

The owners of the property and their agents, heirs, or assigns shall be responsible for the installation, preservation, and maintenance of all planting and physical features shown on this plan. The owners shall be responsible for maintenance of the vegetation, including but not limited to:

(a) Fertilization.

(b) Pruning.

(Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.128.110 Performance assurance/bonding.

In the event that landscaping improvements cannot be installed prior to final plat, final short plat, final binding site plan or formal certificate of occupancy, a cash deposit, letter of credit or other assurance acceptable to the city equal to 150 percent of the estimated landscaping and installation costs must be required. Such deposit must be accompanied by a letter which stipulates completion of all landscape development no later than the next autumn planting season following issuance of the certificate of occupancy or date of final approval, whichever is later. If these conditions are not met, the city may use the deposit to install the landscaping. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).


20.128.120 Maintenance assurance/bonding.

Prior to granting a (permanent) certificate of occupancy and/or granting final approval of site improvements, the owner of the subject property shall provide a two-year landscape maintenance bond, cash set-aside, or other assurance acceptable to the city (hereafter “assurance”) in an amount equal to 125 percent of the estimated landscaping and installation costs for the project. It shall be the owner’s responsibility to request a landscape maintenance inspection at least two years after city acceptance upon final landscaping installation inspection. The assurance shall not be released by the city unless the city finds upon inspection that the landscaping has been maintained and is in good health. If the city finds that the landscaping has not been maintained or is not in good health, the city may at its option require the owner to maintain and restore the required landscaping to healthy conditions prior to releasing the landscape maintenance assurance, or may itself perform work to correct the deficiencies using the provided assurance. In the event that a significant amount of the required landscaping requires replacement as determined by the director, the city may require an additional two-year landscape maintenance assurance on all or a portion of the required landscaping. (Ord. 011-19 § 5 (Exh. 2)).

(j) Providing recreational benefits;

(k) Enhancing the economic value of developments; and

(l) Providing a valuable asset to the community. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.129.020 Applicability.

(1) This chapter applies to all significant trees in the city.

(2) No significant tree may be removed unless the requirements of this chapter are met.

(3) The following situations, activities, and projects are exempt from the significant tree protection requirements of this section unless the tree is located in a critical area as identified in Chapter 20.162 POMC:

(a) Utility developments.

(b) Roadway or street (including sidewalks) construction.

(c) Parks projects.

(d) Trees that interfere with overhead utility lines.

(e) Trees that are causing damage to building foundations.

(4) This chapter shall not be construed to authorize the removal of trees where tree removal is not otherwise permitted in the POMC. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.129.030 Definitions.

(1) Significant trees are those trees with a DBH (diameter at breast height) of 18 inches or greater and which are not identified by a licensed arborist as damaged, diseased, or a safety hazard due to potential root, trunk or primary limb failure, or new exposure to wind after having grown in a closed, forested situation.

(2) The root protection zone is equal to one-foot radius from the center of the tree for every one inch of tree DBH. A modified root protection zone may be established by a certified arborist’s individual tree evaluation. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.129.040 Removal and replacement of all significant trees.

(1) Approval of the director is required for the removal of significant trees and shall be granted; provided, that all other applicable requirements and standards of the Port Orchard Municipal Code are met. The decision to authorize the removal of a significant tree shall be a Type 1 decision; however, an application that involves two or more procedures may be processed consistent with the procedures provided in POMC 20.22.020(2). Approval requires that the following condition and the replacement requirements of subsection (2) are met:

(a) All significant trees located within any required landscape buffer area or required landscape planting area shall be retained to the extent practical and feasible.

(b) This provision shall not be construed as to prohibit mass grading; provided, that significant trees are replaced in accordance with this chapter.

(2) Significant trees that are removed shall be replaced with trees meeting the following requirements:

(a) Trees must be replaced at the rates described in Table 20.129.040 and at no less than a 1:1 ratio for any proposed development. If the number of replacement trees required in accordance with Table 20.129.040 results in a fraction, the number shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Table 20.129.040 Replacement Tree Quantity 

	Significant Tree Diameter	Number of Replacement Trees Required

	18 – 22 inches diameter	0.5

	22 – 28 inches diameter	1

	28 – 36 inches diameter	2

	Greater than 36 inches diameter	3

(b) To incentivize significant tree retention, every significant tree that is retained shall reduce the required number of replacement trees by three trees.

(c) Replacement deciduous trees shall be fully branched, have a dominant leader branch, have a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches (as measured 24 inches above the root ball), and a minimum height of six feet at the time of planting as measured from the top of the leader branch to the top of the root ball.

(d) A replacement deciduous tree that has a minimum caliper of three inches (as measured 24 inches above the root ball) and a minimum height of eight feet at the time of planting as measured from the top of the leader branch to the top of the root ball may substitute for two required replacement trees.

(e) Replacement evergreen trees shall be fully branched and a minimum of six feet in height, measured from the top of the leader branch to the top of the root ball, at the time of planting.

(f) Replacement trees shall primarily be those species native to the Pacific Northwest. In making a determination regarding the species of replacement trees, the director shall defer to the species selected by the property owner unless the director determines that the species selected is unlikely to survive for a period of at least 10 years, represents a danger or nuisance, or would threaten overhead or underground utilities.

(g) The property owner shall maintain all replacement trees in a healthy condition. The property owner shall be obligated to replace any replacement tree that dies, becomes diseased, or is removed. Replacement trees shall not be removed except when they are moved to another location in accordance with this chapter.

(h) The director may authorize the planting of fewer and smaller replacement trees if the property owner can demonstrate the reduction is suitable for the site conditions, neighborhood character, and the purposes of this section, and that such replacement trees will be planted in sufficient quantities to meet the intent of this section. The director may require a certifying statement from a Washington State licensed landscape architect, Washington-certified professional horticulturalist (CPH), or certified arborist.

(3) If the site does not allow for planting of replacement trees, the trees may be planted (a) on an alternative site within the city, or (b) on public property (such as in a city park) subject to the approval of the public works director. If the trees are not planted on public property, guarantees shall be provided (such as a conservation easement) to ensure that the replacement trees will not be removed prior to reaching 18 inches DBH (at which time they will be considered significant trees).

(4) The director shall not authorize the planting of shrubs or bushes in lieu of required replacement trees.

(5) For projects containing five or fewer significant trees, the required replacement trees planted shall be in addition to other required trees installed to satisfy street tree and landscaping buffer, parking lot, and other landscape area requirements. For projects on nonforested sites containing more than five significant trees, up to 75 percent of the required replacement trees to be planted may be satisfied by planting trees within required or proposed landscaping areas including but not limited to landscape buffers and parking lot islands as specified in Chapter 20.128 POMC. For projects on forested sites containing more than five significant trees, up to 100 percent of the required replacement trees to be planted may be satisfied by planting trees within required or proposed landscaping areas including but not limited to landscape buffers and parking lot islands as specified in Chapter 20.128 POMC. For the purposes of this section, a site is considered forested if it contains more than 20 significant trees per acre.

(6) Guidelines for Significant Tree Replacement. The following guidelines and requirements shall apply to significant tree replacement:

(a) When individual trees or tree stands are protected, replacement trees should be planted to reestablish or enhance tree clusters where they previously existed.

(b) Replacement trees shall be planted in locations appropriate to the species’ growth habit and horticultural requirements.

(c) Replacement trees shall be planted in areas that connect or are adjacent to native growth protection areas or other open space, where appropriate.

(d) Replacement trees shall be integrated into the required landscape plans, if any, for a development.

(e) Replacement trees to be planted next to or under power lines shall be selected with consideration of the trees’ maturation and maintenance requirements. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).


20.129.050 Retention and protection of significant trees associated with development proposals.

(1) Significant Tree Retention Plan. The applicant or property owner shall submit a tree retention plan prepared by a certified arborist, horticulturalist, landscape architect, forester or other qualified professional concurrent with the underlying development permit application (such as a land disturbing activity, short subdivision, binding site plan, conditional use, building, or preliminary subdivision permit application), whichever is reviewed and approved first. The tree retention plan shall consist of:

(a) A tree survey that identifies the location, size, and species of individual significant trees or the perimeter of stands of trees on a site;

(b) Identification of the significant trees that are proposed to be retained; and

(c) The location and design of root protection during construction and development activities.

(2) Exemption. Significant tree retention plans shall not be required for the construction of a detached house or backyard cottage, but these projects shall comply with all other sections of this chapter.

(3) Protection of Significant Trees. To provide protection for significant trees that are to remain during and after development activity the following standards apply:

(a) Prior to construction, grading, or other land development, each root protection zone is identified with a temporary chain-link or orange mesh fence with a minimum height of five feet.

(b) No impervious surfaces, fill, excavation, or storage of construction materials shall be permitted within the root protection zone.

(c) Alternative protection methods may be used if determined by the director to provide equal or greater significant tree protection. (Ord. 011-19 § 4 (Exh. 1)).

Article I. General Provisions


20.132.010 Intent and purpose. 

(1) Intent. Signs have a strong visual impact on the character and quality of the community. As a prominent part of the scenery, they attract or repel the viewing public, affect the safety of vehicular traffic, and their suitability or appropriateness helps to set the tone for the neighborhood. Because the city relies upon its scenery and physical beauty to attract commerce, aesthetic considerations assume economic value. It is the intent of the city, through this chapter, to protect and enhance the city’s historic and residential character and its economic base through the provision of appropriate and aesthetic signage. In addition, it is the intent of the city to limit the size, type and location of signs in order to minimize their distracting effect on drivers and thereby improve traffic safety.

(2) Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and welfare through a comprehensive system of reasonable, effective, consistent, content-neutral and nondiscriminatory sign standards and requirements. This chapter has also been adopted to:

(a) Promote and accomplish the goals, policies and objectives of the city’s comprehensive plan and zoning code;

(b) To provide minimum standards in order to safeguard life, health, property and public welfare, and promote traffic safety by controlling the design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location and maintenance of signs and sign structures;

(c) Recognize free speech rights by regulating signs in a content-neutral manner;

(d) Promote the free flow of traffic and protect pedestrians and motorists from injury and property damage caused by, or which may be fully or partially attributable to, cluttered, distracting and/or illegible signage;

(e) Protect the beauty of the city’s built environment by encouraging signs that are compatible with the architectural style, characteristics and scale of the building to which it may be attached, and to encourage signs that are compatible with adjacent buildings and businesses;

(f) Protect property values, the local economy, and the quality of life by preserving and enhancing the appearance of the streetscape;

(g) Provide consistent sign design standards;

(h) Protect and encourage creative and innovative approaches to signage, and signs that are of a quality design, pleasing in appearance and are appropriate in size, materials and illumination to the surrounding neighborhood;

(i) Provide an improved visual environment for the citizens of and visitors to the city; 

(j) Adopt clear, understandable regulations which enable the fair and consistent enforcement of this chapter; and 

(k) Address emerging trends in digital and electronic sign technologies and provide regulations that facilitate use of such technologies while ensuring protection of motorists and pedestrians from the hazards of glare, startling bursts of light, and use of virtual movement and animation intended to attract driver attention, to hold driver gaze, and/or to otherwise distract drivers from the safe operation of their vehicles. Protect neighborhoods, surrounding development and the night sky from the nuisance factors associated with such glare, movement and animation of digital and electronic signs. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.132.020 Applicability and interpretations. 

(1) This chapter applies to all signs as defined in POMC 20.132.290, Definitions, within the city which are visible or audible from any street, sidewalk or public place, regardless of the type or nature. A sign permit shall be required prior to the installation or modification of any sign defined in POMC 20.132.290 unless the installation or modification of the sign is explicitly listed as exempt from sign permit requirements under POMC 20.132.030 or if a requirement to obtain a sign permit is explicitly waived in another section of this chapter. Regardless of whether or not a sign is exempt from sign permit requirements, all signs shall comply with the standards of this chapter.

(2) This chapter is not intended to, and shall not be interpreted to, restrict speech on the basis of its content, viewpoint, or message. Any classification of signs in this chapter which purports to permit speech by reason of the type of sign, identity of the sign user or otherwise, shall be interpreted to allow commercial or noncommercial speech on the sign. No part of this chapter shall be construed to favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech. To the extent that any provision of this chapter is ambiguous, the term shall be interpreted not to regulate speech on the basis of the content of the message. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.132.030 Exemptions.

(g) The variance is consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan; and

(h) The applicant has established that there are practical difficulties in complying with the provision(s) of this chapter and that the proposed sign is a reasonable use of the property. Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties; and

(i) The plight of the applicant is due to circumstances unique to the property, which were not created by the applicant or landowner; and

(j) The variance will not permit any sign or use that is not allowed in the zoning district where the affected land is located, nor will it allow any sign or sign feature prohibited under POMC 20.132.040, Prohibited signs.

(6) First Amendment Exception/Variance. Where an applicant can demonstrate that the strict application of the regulations in this chapter would violate his/her First Amendment rights, the city may grant a variance that does not conform to all of the variance criteria in subsection (5) of this section. However, the applicant shall submit an application which provides his/her response to each of the variance criteria in subsection (5) of this section. The city need not make findings that all of the variance criteria have been satisfied, but the city shall grant such variance only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the applicant’s First Amendment rights. If a First Amendment exception is granted, it shall be treated as an approval of a variance for purposes of this chapter.

(7) Notice of Final Decision. A notice of decision incorporating the decision on the variance application shall issue not more than 120 days after issuance of the determination of complete application.

(8) Expiration of Variance. If the variance is approved, the sign identified in the variance must be installed within 180 days or the variance will expire.

Article III. Sign Standards Applicable to All Signs


20.132.090 Sign illumination.

(1) General. No temporary sign may be illuminated. No sign located in a residential zone may be illuminated, except that on parcels two acres in size or greater, signs may be halo illuminated or illuminated as necessary for allowable digital signs. Permanent signs allowed by this chapter may be nonilluminated, or illuminated by internal light fixtures, halo illuminated, or have external indirect illumination, unless otherwise specified. All illuminated signs shall comply with the time limitations of subsection (4) of this section. 

(2) Externally Illuminated Signs. 

(a) Except as provided in this subsection, externally illuminated signs shall be illuminated only with steady, stationary, fully shielded light sources directed solely onto the sign without causing glare. Light shielding shall ensure that the lamp or light source is not visible beyond the premises and shall further ensure that the light is contained within the sign face. 

(b) A light fixture mounted above the sign face may be installed with its bottom opening tilted toward the sign face, provided: 

(i) The bottom opening of the light fixture is flat (i.e., it could be covered by a flat board allowing no light to escape); and 

(ii) The uppermost portion of the fixture’s opening is located no higher than the top of the sign face, as shown in Figure 1 below. Light fixtures aimed and installed in this fashion shall be considered fully shielded.

(4) Time Limitations. All signs over three square feet in area shall be turned off by 11:00 p.m., or when the business closes, whichever is later. Signs subject to time limitations are required to have functioning and properly adjusted automatic shut-off timers. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.132.100 Sign materials.

(1) Temporary Signs. The construction of temporary signs is described in the definition of “temporary sign” in POMC 20.132.290, Definitions. However, temporary signs may be made of any material; provided, that the temporary sign otherwise conforms to the requirements of this chapter, including, but not limited to, POMC 20.132.270, Temporary signs. 

(2) Permanent Signs. Permanent signs must be manufactured of durable materials that withstand the effects of water and wind. The following additional requirements apply to any permanent signs larger than 30 square feet, except for window signs located inside glass:

(a) Paper-faced sign, including vinyl-coated paper and those applied with adhesives, are not allowed. Canvas or vinyl signs must be made of minimum 20-ounce materials with polymeric plasticizers for durability.

(b) Sign faces made of canvas, fabric, vinyl or similar pliable materials that are attached to permanent sign structures must be mounted behind a perimeter frame or trim cap so that the edges of the sign face are not exposed, except that flags made of 100 percent spun polyester are exempt from this requirement. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.132.110 Sign placement and location restrictions. 

(1) City Right-of-Way. No sign may be placed within the roadway portion of the city’s right-of-way, except as otherwise permitted in this chapter. If a sign is allowed within a city right-of-way, a street use permit or special event permit may be required. 

(2) Attached to Vehicles on Private Premises. No sign may be mounted, attached or painted on a trailer, boat or motor vehicle, which is parked, stored or displayed conspicuously on private premises in a manner intended to attract the attention of the public. (This excludes signs that are permanently painted or wrapped on the surface of the vehicle, or adhesive vinyl film affixed to the interior or exterior surface of a vehicle window, or signs magnetically attached to motor vehicles or rolling stock that are actively used in the daily conduct of business. However, such vehicles shall be operable and parked in a lawful or authorized manner.) 

(3) Attached to Other Fixtures. No sign may be painted, attached or mounted on fuel tanks, storage containers and/or solid waste receptacles or their enclosures, except for information required by law. 

(4) Freeway-Oriented Signs. Freeway-oriented signs are prohibited, except in the following instances: 

(a) Building-mounted wall signs (POMC 20.132.170), window signs (POMC 20.132.280) and temporary signs (POMC 20.132.270) as otherwise allowed by this chapter may face the freeway if: 

(i) They are installed by a business that has its primary customer entrance facing the freeway; and 

(ii) The wall, window or temporary sign also faces an intervening parking lot or frontage road that serves the business.

(b) Freestanding signs as otherwise allowed by this chapter are allowed for businesses located on and facing frontage roads along freeways, even if such signs are incidentally visible from the freeway. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.132.120 Sign area measurements.

Sign area for all sign types is measured as follows: 

(1) Background Panel or Surface. Sign copy mounted, affixed or painted on a background panel or surface distinctively painted, textured or constructed as a background for the sign copy, is measured as that area contained within the smallest rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, or circle that will enclose the sign copy and the background.

(2) Individual Letters or Graphics. Sign copy mounted as individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia, mansard or parapet of a building or surface of another structure, that has not been painted, textured or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is measured as the sum of the smallest square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle or circle that will enclose each word, name, sentence and complete message, and each graphic in the sign.

(3) Illuminated Surface. If sign copy is mounted, affixed or painted on an illuminated surface or illuminated element of a building or structure, the sign area is measured as the entire illuminated surface or illuminated element which contains sign copy. Such elements may include, but are not limited to, illuminated canopy fascia signs and/or interior illuminated awnings. 

(4) Backlit Translucent Panels. Backlit translucent panels and spandrels, with or without text or graphics, are measured as the area of the height and width of any internally illuminated translucent panel or spandrel, including the side panels if the structure or spandrel is greater than six inches in width.

(5) Multiface Signs. Multiface signs, as shown in Figure 8, are measured as follows: 

(a) Two Face Signs. If the interior angle between the two sign faces is 45 degrees or less, the sign area is of one sign face only. If the angle between the two sign faces is greater than 45 degrees, the sign area is the sum of the areas of the two sign faces. 

(b) Three or Four Face Signs. The sign area is 50 percent of the sum of the areas of all sign faces. 

(c) Spherical, free-form, sculptural or other nonplanar sign area is measured as 50 percent of the sum of the areas using only the four vertical sides of the smallest four-sided polyhedron that will encompass the sign structure. Signs with greater than four polyhedron faces are prohibited. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.132.130 Sign height measurement.

Sign height is measured as follows: 

(1) Freestanding Signs. Sign height is measured as the vertical distance from natural grade at the base of a sign to the top of the sign, including the sign support structure; except that signs within 25 feet of an adjacent road may be measured as follows: 

(a) If natural grade at the base of a sign is higher than the grade of the adjacent road, sign height shall be measured from the base of the sign. 

(b) If natural grade at the base of the sign is lower than the grade of an adjacent road, the height of the sign shall be measured from the top of curb or road-grade elevation; provided, that fill is placed between the curb and the sign and extends at least five feet beyond the base of the sign in all directions. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


20.132.140 Sign structure and installation.

(1) Support Elements. Any angle iron, bracing, guy wires or similar features used to support a sign shall not be visible from publicly accessible areas. 

(2) Electrical Service. When electrical service is provided to freestanding signs or to signs located on a wall within a landscaped area, all such electrical service is required to be underground and concealed. Electrical service to building-mounted wall signs, including conduit, housings and wire, shall be concealed or, when necessary, painted to match the surface of the structure upon which they are mounted. An electrical permit must be issued prior to the installation of any new signs requiring electrical service. 

(3) Raceway Cabinets. Raceway cabinets, where used as an element of building-mounted wall signs, shall match the building color at the location of the building where the sign is located. Where a raceway cabinet provides a contrast background to sign copy, the colored area is considered part of the sign face and is counted in the aggregate sign area permitted for the site or business. Examples of raceway cabinets are shown in Figure 3. 

Figure 3 Raceway Cabinets
[IMAGE]


(4) Limitation on Attachments and Secondary Uses. All permitted sign structures and their associated landscape areas shall be kept free of supplemental attachments or secondary uses including, but not limited to, supplemental signs not part of a permitted sign, light fixtures, newspaper distribution racks or trash containers. The use of sign structures and associated landscape areas as bicycle racks or support structures for signs that are not permitted is prohibited. (Ord. 024-17 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

20.139.045 Roof design.

This section shall apply to detached houses, all duplex types, and attached houses.

(1) A variety of articulated roof forms shall be provided for each individual home that emphasize building form to create visual interest to the neighborhood and to avoid a monotonous series of rooflines. Roof should exhibit variety between different plans by using front-to-rear and side-to-side gabled and hipped roofs, and/or by the introduction of single-story elements. Roof materials, colors and treatments should correspond to the individual character or style of the home and should be compatible with the overall look of the neighborhood.

(2) All buildings with pitched roofs shall have a minimum slope of four feet vertical rise for every 12 feet of horizontal run on the primary roof of the building. A continuous pitched roof shall extend no more than 40 linear feet unless it contains roof elements. Roof elements may include at least one of the following:

(a) Dormers.

(b) Cupolas.

(c) Gable or hip projection.

(d) Hipped roofs or similar construction are encouraged alongside yards in neighborhoods with closely-adjacent homes to maximize solar access to neighboring homes and/or private open space, as shown below.

The soils or geotechnical engineer shall be retained as the engineer-of-record for the duration of the project. An application for a land disturbing activity permit for tree cutting meeting the definition of a minor development will not require a soils report unless deemed necessary by the city engineer.

(3) Grading Plan. Land disturbing activities that include grading and which meet the definition of a major development shall be required to have an approved engineered grading plan.

(4) Abbreviated Grading Plan. Land disturbing activities that include grading and which meet the definition of a minor development will require an approved abbreviated grading plan in lieu of an engineered grading plan. An abbreviated grading plan is a grading plan that does not require preparation and signature by a professional civil engineer.

(5) Erosion and Sedimentation Control. The grading plan shall include a temporary erosion and sedimentation control plan. The plan shall clearly indicate the construction sequence for establishment of all erosion and sedimentation control work, both temporary and permanent. The plan shall conform to all requirements and standards for erosion and sedimentation control set forth in this chapter.

(6) Critical Areas. If the land disturbing activity is proposed to take place in or adjacent to a critical area as regulated in Chapter 20.162 POMC, additional information as required by that chapter shall be submitted with the application.

(7) Tree Cutting. An application for a land disturbing activity permit for tree cutting meeting the definition of minor development will require an abbreviated tree removal plan in lieu of an engineered grading plan or abbreviated grading plan. Abbreviated tree removal plans must indicate the approximate location of the tree(s) to be removed, the species of tree(s) to be retained and removed, the diameter at breast height of each tree to be removed, and the relative location of adjacent (within 75 feet) trees to be retained, buildings, and/or improvements. Any abbreviated tree removal plan shall comply with Chapter 20.129 POMC if significant plans may be required by the director.

If sediment is transported onto a road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly, as a minimum, at the end of each day. Sediment shall be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping and be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner.

(l) Dewatering Construction Sites. Dewatering devices shall discharge into a sediment trap or sediment pond.

(m) Control of Pollutants Other Than Sediment on Construction Sites. All pollutants other than sediment that occur on site during construction shall be handled and legally disposed of in a manner that does not cause contamination of stormwater.

(n) Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function. All maintenance and repair shall be conducted in accordance with the manual. The applicant shall be responsible for assuring that any such facilities damaged during floods, storms or other adverse weather conditions are immediately returned to normal operating condition.

(o) Removal of Temporary BMPs. All temporary erosion and sedimentation control BMPs shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary BMPs are no longer needed. Trapped sediment shall be removed or stabilized on site. Disturbed soil areas resulting from removal of temporary BMPs shall be permanently stabilized. The removal of temporary erosion and sedimentation control BMPs may not be required for those projects, such as single-family plats, that will be followed by additional construction under a different permit. In these circumstances, the need for removing or retaining the measures will be evaluated on a site-specific basis.

(p) Financial Liability. A performance covenant, performance bonding, or other appropriate financial instruments, required by Chapter 20.150 POMC, shall ensure compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.

(5) Erosion Control Design Storm Event. Facilities designed for the control of erosion and sedimentation shall be designed for the erosion and sedimentation control design storm event, defined as the six-month, 24-hour duration storm. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

(3) The following state and local regulations and guidelines pertaining to surface and stormwater design and management are adopted by reference and shall be collectively referred to as the “Port Orchard stormwater manuals” or the “stormwater manuals”:

(a) The 2012 Edition (as amended in December 2014) of the Washington State Department of Ecology Stormwater Manual for Western Washington;

(b) The 2012 Edition of the Puget Sound Partnership Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound;

(c) The city of Port Orchard design and construction standards; and 

(d) The definitions, minimum requirements, adjustment, and variance criteria found in Appendix 1 of the Western Washington Phase II Municipal Stormwater Permit, except that the erosivity waiver is not adopted.

(e) All references to this chapter shall include the Port Orchard stormwater manuals adopted herein.

(4) All development proposal activities in the city shall comply with the standards, specifications, and requirements contained in the city’s stormwater regulations and stormwater manuals. When best management practices (BMPs) are required by this chapter or any other chapter of the POMC, they shall comply with the stormwater manuals.

(8) Compliance with the regulations in this chapter and the stormwater manuals does not necessarily mitigate all probable and significant environmental impacts to aquatic biota. Fishery resources and other living components of aquatic systems are affected by a complex set of factors. While employing a specific flow control standard may prevent stream channel erosion or instability, other factors affecting fish and other biotic resources (such as increases in stream flow velocities) are not directly addressed by the stormwater manuals. Thus, compliance with the stormwater manuals should not be construed as mitigating all probable and significant stormwater impacts, and additional mitigation, beyond what is required in the stormwater manuals, may be required to protect aquatic biota in streams and wetlands. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.070 Special stormwater drainage improvements.

In order to mitigate or eliminate potential drainage-related impacts on critical drainage areas, the director may require drainage improvements in excess of those required in this chapter and the stormwater manuals.

(10) Basic Treatment Requirements. Basic treatment applies to:

(a) Project sites that discharge to the ground, unless:

(i) The soil suitability criteria for infiltration treatment are met (see the manual for soil suitability criteria); or

(ii) The project uses infiltration strictly for flow control and not treatment and the discharge is within one-quarter mile of a phosphorus sensitive lake (use a phosphorus treatment facility), or within one-quarter mile of a fish-bearing stream or a lake (use an enhanced treatment facility);

(b) Residential projects not otherwise needing phosphorus control as designated by U.S. EPA, the Department of Ecology, or by the city of Port Orchard;

(c) Project sites discharging directly to salt waters, river segments, and lakes listed in Appendix 1-C of the currently adopted Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington;

For developments with a mix of land use types, the basic treatment requirement shall apply when the runoff from the areas subject to the basic treatment requirement comprise 50 percent or more of the total runoff.

(11) Flow Control (Minimum Requirement No. 7). Except as provided in subsection (12) of this section, the following require construction of flow control facilities and/or land use management BMPs that result in stormwater discharges that match developed condition discharge durations to predeveloped condition durations for the range of predeveloped discharge rates from 50 percent of the two-year peak flow up to the full 50-year peak flow:

(a) Projects in which the total of effective impervious surfaces is 10,000 square feet or more;

(b) Projects that convert three-quarter acre or more of native vegetation to lawn or landscape, or convert two and one-half acres or more of native vegetation to pasture, and from which there is a surface discharge in a natural or manmade conveyance system from the site; or

(c) Projects that through a combination of effective impervious surfaces and converted pervious surfaces cause a one-tenth cubic foot per second increase in the 100-year flow frequency as estimated using the Western Washington Hydrology Model or other approved model.

(12) Flow Control Exemption. Flow control is not required for projects that discharge directly to Puget Sound if all the following are satisfied:

(a) Direct discharge to the exempt receiving water does not result in the diversion of drainage from any perennial stream classified as Types 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the State of Washington Interim Water Typing System, or Types “S,” “F,” or “Np” in the Permanent Water Typing System, or from any Category I, II, or III wetland;

(b) Flow splitting devices or drainage BMPs are applied to route natural runoff volumes from the project site to any downstream Type 5 stream or Category IV wetland:

(i) Design of flow splitting devices or drainage BMPs will be based on continuous hydrologic modeling analysis. The design will assure that flows delivered to Type 5 stream reaches will approximate, but in no case exceed, durations ranging from 50 percent of the two-year to the 50-year peak flow; and

(ii) Flow splitting devices or drainage BMPs that deliver flow to Category IV wetlands will also be designed using continuous hydrologic modeling to preserve preproject wetland hydrologic conditions unless specifically waived or exempted by regulatory agencies with permitting jurisdiction;

(c) The project site must be drained by a conveyance system that is comprised entirely of manmade conveyance elements (e.g., pipes, ditches, outfall protection, etc.) and extends to the ordinary high water line of the exempt receiving water;

(d) The conveyance system between the project site and the exempt receiving water shall have sufficient hydraulic capacity to convey discharges from future build-out conditions (under current zoning) of the site, and the existing condition from nonproject areas from which runoff is or will be collected;

(e) Any erodible elements of the manmade conveyance system must be adequately stabilized to prevent erosion; and

(f) Shoreline erosion is avoided through the use of appropriate energy dissipation or other protective measures.

(13) Wetlands Protection (Minimum Requirement No. 8).

(a) Discharges to wetlands shall maintain the hydrologic conditions, hydrophytic vegetation, and substrate characteristics necessary to support existing and designated uses. The hydrologic analysis shall use the existing land cover condition to determine the existing hydrologic conditions unless directed otherwise by a regulatory agency with jurisdiction.

(b) Stormwater treatment and flow control facilities shall not be built within a natural vegetated buffer, except for:

(i) Necessary conveyance systems as approved by the permittee; or

(ii) As allowed in wetlands approved for hydrologic modification and/or treatment in accordance with Guidesheet 1B in Appendix 1-D of the currently adopted Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington.

(c) An adopted and implemented basin plan prepared in accordance with the provisions of POMC 20.150.230 may be used to develop requirements for wetlands that are tailored to a specific basin.

(14) Operation and Maintenance (Minimum Requirement No. 9). All stormwater facilities shall be operated and maintained in accordance with POMC 20.150.260. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.170 Standards – Redevelopment activities.

(1) Where redevelopment activities meet the definition of a major development, the requirements of this section shall apply to that portion of the site that is being redeveloped. In addition, where one or more of the following conditions exist, the requirements of this section shall apply, to the maximum extent practicable, for the entire site, including adjoining parcels, if they are part of the project:

(a) Existing sites greater than one acre in size with 35 percent or more impervious surface;

(b) Sites that discharge to a receiving water that has a documented water quality problem; and

(c) Sites where the need for additional stormwater control measures has been identified through a basin plan.

(2) Approved Hydrological Methods for Design. Estimation of peak stormwater runoff rates used in the design of stormwater quantity control facilities shall utilize hydrograph methods of analysis approved by the director. The design of storage facilities that are a part of stormwater quantity control facilities shall be designed using methods approved by the director. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.180 Standards – Stormwater quantity control.

The following minimum requirements for stormwater quantity control shall apply to all development proposals that meet the definition of a major development:

(1) All surface water and stormwater entering the development site in its predevelopment state shall be received at the naturally occurring or otherwise legally existing locations. All surface water and stormwater leaving the development site shall be discharged at all times during and after development at the naturally occurring or otherwise legally existing locations so as not to be diverted onto or away from adjacent downstream properties, except diversion which will correct an existing manmade downstream problem may be permitted by the director. For the purposes of this chapter, “naturally occurring location” shall mean the location of those channels, swales, and preexisting and established systems as defined by the first documented topographic contours existing for the subject property, either from maps or photographs, site inspections, decisions of a court of law, or other means determined appropriate by the director.

(2) The post-development peak stormwater discharge rates from the development site for the two-, 10-, and 100-year, 24-hour duration storm events and the 100-year, seven-day duration storm event shall at no time exceed the predevelopment peak stormwater runoff rates for the same design storm events, except as expressly permitted by this chapter. Also, where stormwater directly or indirectly discharges to open channels or streams, streambank erosion protection is required; the post-development peak stormwater discharge rate from the development site for the two-year, 24-hour duration storm event shall not exceed 50 percent of the predevelopment peak stormwater runoff rate for the same design storm event. The director may require that runoff from a development site be controlled for additional design storm events.

(3) Closed depressions shall be analyzed using hydrograph routing methods. Infiltration shall be addressed where appropriate. If a proposed project will discharge runoff to an existing closed depression that has greater than 5,000 square feet of water surface area at overflow elevation, the following requirements must be met:

(a) Case 1. The predevelopment 100-year, seven-day and 24-hour duration design storms from the drainage basin tributary to the closed depression are routed into the closed depression using only infiltration as outflow. If the design storms do not overflow the closed depression, no runoff may leave the site for the same storm events following development of a proposed project. This may be accomplished by excavating additional volume in the closed depression subject to all applicable requirements. If a portion of the depression is located off of the project site, impacts to adjacent properties shall be evaluated.

(b) Case 2. The predevelopment 100-year, seven-day and 24-hour duration design storm events from the drainage basin tributary to the closed depression are routed to the closed depression using only infiltration as outflow, and overflow occurs. The closed depression shall then be analyzed as a detention/infiltration pond. The required performance, therefore, shall not exceed the predevelopment runoff rates for 50 percent of the two-year and 100 percent of the 10-year and 100-year, 24-hour duration and 100-year, seven-day duration design storms. This will require that a control structure, emergency overflow spillway, access road, and other applicable design criteria be met. If the facility will be maintained by the city, the closed depression shall be placed in a dedicated tract. If the facility will be privately maintained, the tract shall be located within a drainage easement. If a portion of the depression is located off of the project site, impacts to adjacent properties shall be evaluated.

(c) Case 3. When a proposed project is contributory to a closed depression located off site, the volume of runoff discharged may not be increased for the two-, 10-, and 100-year, 24-hour duration, and the 100-year, seven-day duration storm events. The exception to this requirement is in the case where discharge would not result in an increase in water surface elevation of greater than one-one-hundredth foot for the 100-year storm events.

(4) Land developments shall provide stormwater quantity control facilities designed to meet, as a minimum performance standard, the requirements of this section, except in the following circumstances:

(a) The development site discharges directly into Puget Sound, or directly into the tidally influenced areas of rivers and streams discharging into Puget Sound, where runoff quantity control is not required by other governmental agencies.

(b) The development site discharges to a regional stormwater facility approved by the director to receive the developed site runoff.

(c) The development site discharges to a receiving body of water (lake, wetland, etc.) where it can be demonstrated by the applicant, to the satisfaction of the director, that stormwater quantity control is not warranted.

(5) In the event that conditions downstream from a proposed development site are determined by the director to be exceptionally sensitive to potential stormwater discharges from the subject site, the director may require a factor of safety be applied to the total retention/detention storage volume and/or a reduction of allowable stormwater release rates.

(6) Submittals for all proposed development projects shall include an analysis of downstream water quantity impacts resulting from the project and shall provide for mitigation of these impacts. The analysis shall extend a minimum of one-quarter of a mile downstream from the project. The existing or potential impacts to be evaluated and mitigated shall include, but not be limited to, excessive streambank erosion, flooding, surcharging of existing closed drainage conveyance facilities, discharge to closed depressions, and discharge to existing off-site runoff control facilities.

(7) Retention facilities and open stormwater quantity control facilities shall not be located in dedicated public road rights-of-way.

(8) Reasonable access for maintenance, as determined by the director, shall be provided to all stormwater facilities.

(9) As the first priority, streambank erosion control BMPs shall utilize infiltration to the fullest extent practicable, only if site conditions are appropriate and ground water quality is protected. Streambank erosion control BMPs shall be selected, designed, and maintained according to the manual. Streambank erosion control BMPs shall not be built within a natural vegetated buffer, except for necessary conveyance systems as approved by the department of public works. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.190 Standards – Water quality BMPs.

(1) Water quality best management practices (BMPs) shall be used to the maximum extent practicable to control pollution in stormwater. Water quality BMPs shall be used to comply with the standards of this chapter, including those contained in the stormwater manual. Construction and post-development water quality BMPs shall be utilized for all developments. Said water quality BMPs shall provide runoff water quality treatment for all storm events with intensities less than or equal to the water quality design storm event, as defined in this chapter.

(2) Illicit Discharges. Illicit discharges or illicit connections to a stormwater drainage system, pursuant to Chapter 15.30 POMC are prohibited.

(3) Experimental Best Management Practices. In those instances where appropriate best management practices are not in the stormwater manual, experimental BMPs should be considered. In an effort to improve stormwater quality technology, experimental BMPs are encouraged as a means of solving problems in a manner not addressed by the stormwater manual. Experimental BMPs must be approved by the director. The director may require that the performance of experimental BMPs be monitored to document their effectiveness for future use.

(4) Incorporation into Stormwater Quantity Control Facilities. Water quality BMPs may be incorporated into the design of stormwater quantity control facilities where appropriate. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.200 Standards – Stormwater conveyance facilities.

(1) All proposed developments must provide on-site stormwater conveyance facilities having sufficient capacity to convey, without flooding or otherwise damaging existing or proposed structures, the post-development peak stormwater runoff rate resulting from a 100-year storm event, plus any existing upstream runoff that will be conveyed through the development site.

(2) Estimation of peak stormwater runoff rates used in the design of water conveyance facilities shall use either the rational method or a hydrograph method of analysis accepted by the director.

(3) Existing drainage ways and/or other conveyance facilities downstream from proposed developments that are identified within the scope of the downstream portion of the off-site drainage analysis shall have sufficient capacity to convey, without flooding or otherwise damaging existing or proposed structures, the post-development peak stormwater discharge for the 25-year storm event. All newly constructed downstream drainage ways and/or conveyance facilities shall have sufficient capacity to convey the post-development peak stormwater discharge for the 100-year storm event. Downstream improvements or additional on-site stormwater quantity control measures shall be provided to eliminate any potential downstream flooding or other damage that may occur following completion of the proposed development. The director has the authority to waive the requirement for downstream improvements.

(4) Drainage through closed conveyance structures such as pipes shall not discharge directly onto the surface of a public road.

(5) Easements, Tracts, and Covenants.

(a) Drainage easements shall be provided in a proposed development for all stormwater conveyance systems that are not located in public rights-of-way or tracts. Said drainage easements shall be granted to the parties responsible for providing ongoing maintenance of the systems.

(b) Stormwater facilities that are to be maintained by the city, together with maintenance access roads to said facilities, shall be located in public right-of-way, separate tracts dedicated to the city, or drainage easements located in designated open space. The exception is for stormwater conveyance pipes that may be located within easements on private property; provided, that all catch basins can be accessed without entering private property.

(c) All runoff from impervious surfaces, roof drains, and yard drains shall be directed so as not to adversely affect adjacent properties. Wording to this effect shall appear on the face of all final plats/PUDs, and shall be contained in any covenants required for a development. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.210 Standards – Wetlands.

The following requirements apply only to situations where stormwater discharges directly or indirectly into a wetland and must be met in addition to meeting the requirements of Volume V and Volume I Appendix 1-D:

(1) Stormwater discharges to wetlands must be controlled and treated to the same extent as all other discharges, with the goal of meeting state water quality and ground water quality standards.

(2) Discharges to wetlands shall maintain the hydroperiod and flows of predevelopment site conditions to the extent necessary to protect the characteristic functions of the wetland. Prior to discharging to a wetland, alternative discharge locations shall be evaluated, and natural water storage and infiltration opportunities outside the wetland shall be maximized.

(3) Created wetlands that are intended to mitigate for loss of wetland acreage, function and value shall not be designed to also treat stormwater.

(4) In order for constructed wetlands to be considered treatment systems, they must be constructed in areas which are not designated as wetland or wetland buffer or in other areas which are in conflict with designated critical areas and associated buffers, and they must be managed for stormwater treatment. If these systems are not managed and maintained in accordance with the manual for a period exceeding three years, these systems may no longer be considered constructed wetlands.

(5) Wetland BMPs shall not be built within a natural vegetated buffer, except for necessary conveyance systems as approved by the department of public works. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.220 Standards – Regional facilities.

When the director has determined that the public would benefit by the establishment of a regional stormwater facility which would serve as an alternative to the construction of separate on-site drainage facilities, the director may recommend to the city council that a regional stormwater facility be constructed which would serve more than one development in providing stormwater quantity and/or quality control. The associated owner(s) shall meet currently adopted stormwater regulations at the time of development. In the event that a regional stormwater facility is required by the city council, such a regional stormwater facility shall be located outside of fish-bearing streams, unless otherwise accepted by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. All future developments constructed on lands designated by the city council to be served by the regional facility shall, at the time of issuance of a stormwater management permit for a development, be required to contribute a fair share to the cost of land purchase, design, and construction of said regional facility. In the event that a proposed regional stormwater facility is not yet in operation at the time of completion of construction of a development that is to be served by said regional facility, the applicant for said development shall be required to provide temporary stormwater quantity and quality controls. Temporary quantity and quality controls may be constructed in temporary easements, rather than in separate tracts. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.230 Standards – Basin planning.

An adopted and implemented basin plan may be used to develop requirements for source control, stormwater treatment, streambank erosion control, wetlands, and water quality sensitive areas that are tailored to a specific basin. Adopted and implemented watershed-based basin plans may be used to modify any or all of the minimum requirements for stormwater quantity or quality control addressed in this chapter; provided, that the level of protection for surface or ground water achieved by the basin plan will equal or exceed that which would otherwise be achieved by implementation of the provisions of this chapter in the absence of a basin plan. Basin plans shall evaluate and include, as necessary, retrofitting of BMPs for existing development and/or redevelopment in order to achieve watershed-wide pollutant reduction goals. Standards developed from basin plans shall not modify any of the above requirements until the basin plan is formally adopted and fully implemented by the city. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.240 Standards – Exemptions.

Residential lots one acre or larger shall be exempt from the provisions of POMC 20.150.170 through 20.150.230, or as otherwise determined by the director. Cases where this exemption does not apply include, but are not limited to, sites within or adjacent to critical areas or watersheds, steep or unstable slopes, or where the cumulative impacts of development warrant compliance with these provisions. Site development activities taking place on individual lots of one acre or larger, which meet the definition of a major development, are not exempt from the requirements of POMC 20.150.160. Proposed access roadways serving residential lots larger than two and one-half acres, which meet the definition of a major development, are not exempt from the requirements of POMC 20.150.170. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.250 Facilities – Covenants, sureties, and liability insurance.

(1) Site Stabilization Surety. 

(a) Prior to the issuance of a stormwater drainage permit and prior to beginning any construction activity on a project site, the owner of the project will be required to record a performance covenant or post a performance surety for site stabilization and erosion and sedimentation control. In addition, the owner may be required to provide a certificate of commercial liability insurance as outlined in subsection (5) of this section.

(b) This performance requirement for stabilization and erosion control should not be confused with the performance bond accepted at the time of final plat recording as a surety for construction items not yet completed. When a performance bond is accepted for a final plat in lieu of construction completion, the surety or covenant for stabilization and erosion control will be released, and the new performance bond shall cover site stabilization and erosion control along with the other incomplete construction items.

(2) Performance Covenant for Site Stabilization. For project sites with less than five acres of land disturbing activity, a performance covenant may be recorded in lieu of performance surety for site stabilization prior to issuance of the stormwater drainage permit to guarantee the city that temporary erosion and sedimentation control and permanent site stabilization measures will perform in accordance with this chapter. This covenant shall be recorded with the Kitsap County auditor and shall run with the land until such a time as the city issues final acceptance of the permitted activities, or until a separate performance bond is posted prior to final plat approval. Upon issuance of final project approval, the department of public works will record a document that extinguishes the performance covenant.

(3) Performance Surety for Site Stabilization. 

(a) The term “bond” as defined in this chapter shall mean a surety bond, assignment of funds, or irrevocable bank letter of credit. For project sites with five or more acres of land disturbing activity, a performance bond shall be posted prior to issuance of a stormwater drainage permit to guarantee the city that temporary erosion and sedimentation control and permanent site stabilization measures will perform in accordance with this chapter. The amount of the performance bond shall be as follows:

(i) One hundred fifty percent of the estimated cost of performing minor grading and installing temporary erosion and sedimentation control, and permanent site stabilization measures to bring the construction site into compliance with this chapter. A cost estimate shall be submitted by the project engineer subject to the approval of the director. The minimum amount of the bond shall be $5,000; or

(ii) One thousand dollars per acre of land disturbing activity. No engineer’s estimate is required.

(b) If the site work is determined by the director to be in violation of this chapter, the city may use the performance bond to provide temporary and permanent site stabilization.

(c) All performance bonds shall run continuously until released by the city, and shall not be subject to an expiration or cancellation date.

(4) Performance Bond for Uncompleted Site Improvements. 

(a) For single-family residential developments, a performance bond shall be provided prior to the final recording of the plat/PUD, guaranteeing completion of all site improvements not yet completed. The amount of the performance bond shall be 150 percent of the estimated cost of said improvements. The estimated cost of the construction shall be determined by a civil engineer subject to the approval of the director.

(b) All performance bonds shall run continuously until released by the city, and shall not be subject to an expiration or cancellation date.

(5) Commercial Liability Insurance. The owner of any project must provide a certificate of liability insurance to the department of public works prior to issuance of a stormwater drainage permit. The liability insurance shall remain in force until final project approval is issued by the city. The commercial liability insurance shall be in the amount of not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit bodily injury and property damage, with a $2,000,000 aggregate. Such insurance shall include the city of Port Orchard, its officers, and employees as additional insureds, with respect to the terms and conditions of the policy.

(6) Maintenance Bonds. A maintenance bond is required for all subdivisions and commercial projects for which stormwater facilities and/or roads are required pursuant to the following:

(a) Prior to the final approval of construction and release of any performance sureties, a maintenance bond must be posted and maintained by the project owner for a period of two years. 

(b) The maintenance bond shall guarantee the stormwater facilities and roads constructed under permit against design defects and/or failures in workmanship and shall guarantee that the facilities constructed under the permit will be regularly and adequately maintained throughout the maintenance period. At the end of this time, the city will inspect the system and, when the facility is acceptable and 80 percent of the lots in that phase have been improved, the city will release the maintenance bond. In the event that 80 percent of the lots in a residential development have not been improved by the end of the two-year maintenance period, the maintenance bond may be extended, subject to the approval of the director, for one additional year.

(c) The amount of the maintenance bond shall be 10 percent of the estimated construction cost of the stormwater facilities and roads requiring maintenance, or $5,000, whichever is greater. The construction cost of the stormwater facilities requiring maintenance shall be estimated by the project engineer, subject to the approval of the director. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.260 Facilities – Operation and maintenance.

(1) Maintenance of Stormwater Facilities by Owners.

(a) Any person or persons holding title to a nonresidential property for which stormwater facilities and BMPs have been required by the city shall be responsible for the continual operation, maintenance, and repair of said stormwater facilities and BMPs in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(b) For privately maintained stormwater facilities, the maintenance requirements specified in this chapter, including the stormwater manuals, shall be enforced against the owner(s) of the subject property served by the stormwater facility.

(2) Maintenance Covenant Required for Privately Maintained Drainage Facilities.

(a) Prior to the beneficial use of a development constructed under a city permit, the owner shall record a maintenance covenant that guarantees Port Orchard that the owner shall properly operate, maintain, and inspect the stormwater facilities, and that also gives the city the authority to enter and inspect the facility. The restrictions set forth in such covenant shall be included in any instrument of conveyance of the subject property and shall be recorded with the Kitsap County auditor.

(b) The director may require the owners of existing stormwater facilities for which the city has not previously accepted operation and maintenance responsibility to record a maintenance covenant, or to request that the city accept operation and maintenance responsibility for the stormwater facilities subject to the requirements of this chapter. 

(c) Maintenance covenants shall remain in force for the life of the development, or until the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the subject stormwater facilities is accepted by the city. 

(3) City Acceptance of New Stormwater Facilities. The city may accept for maintenance those new residential stormwater facilities constructed under an accepted stormwater drainage permit that meet the following conditions:

(a) Improvements in residential plats/PRDs have been completed on at least 80 percent of the lots, unless waived by the director; 

(b) All drainage facilities have been inspected and accepted by the director and said drainage facilities have been in satisfactory operation for at least two years; 

(c) All drainage facilities reconstructed during the maintenance period have been accepted by the director; 

(d) The stormwater facility, as designed and constructed, conforms to the provisions of this chapter; 

(e) All easements required under this chapter, entitling the city to properly operate and maintain the subject drainage facility, have been conveyed to the city and have been recorded with the Kitsap County auditor; 

(f) For nonstandard drainage facilities, an operation and maintenance manual, including a maintenance schedule, has been submitted to and accepted by the city; and

(g) A complete and accurate set of reproducible Mylar as-built drawings and a CD containing an acceptable electronic set of as-built drawings have been provided to the city. A professional engineer shall certify that both the vertical and horizontal alignment meet the design objectives.

(h) The director may terminate the city’s assumption of maintenance responsibilities under this section in writing after determining that continued maintenance will not significantly contribute to protecting or improving the health, safety and welfare of the community.

(4) City Acceptance of Existing Stormwater Facilities. The city may accept for maintenance those stormwater facilities for residential developments existing prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter that meet the following conditions:

(a) Improvements in residential plats/PRDs have been completed on at least 80 percent of the lots; and

(b) An inspection by the director has determined that the stormwater facilities are functioning as designed; and

(c) The stormwater facilities have had at least two years of satisfactory operation and maintenance, unless otherwise waived by the director; and

(d) The person or persons holding title to the properties served by the stormwater facilities submit a petition containing the signatures of the title holders of more than 50 percent of the lots served by the stormwater facilities requesting that the city maintain the stormwater facilities; and

(e) All easements required under this chapter, entitling the city to properly operate and maintain the subject stormwater facilities, have been conveyed to the city and have been recorded with the Kitsap County auditor; and

(f) The person or persons holding title to the properties served by the stormwater facilities show proof of the correction of any defects in the drainage facilities, as required by the director. 

(g) The director may terminate the city’s assumption of maintenance responsibilities under this section in writing after determining that continued maintenance will not significantly contribute to protecting or improving the health, safety and welfare of the community.

(5) City Inspections of Privately Maintained Stormwater Facilities.

(a) The director is authorized to develop an inspection program for privately owned and maintained stormwater facilities in the city. The purpose of this inspection program shall be to determine if said stormwater facilities, conveyance structures, and water quality facilities are in good working order and are properly maintained and to ensure that stormwater quality BMPs are in place and that nonpoint source pollution control is being implemented.

(b) Whenever the provisions of the inspection program are being implemented, or whenever there is cause to believe that a violation of this chapter has been or is being committed, the inspector is authorized to inspect during regular working hours and at other reasonable times any and all stormwater drainage facilities within the city to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

(6) Inspection Schedule. The director is authorized to establish a master inspection and maintenance schedule to inspect appropriate stormwater facilities that are not owned and operated by the city. The party (or parties) responsible for maintenance and operation shall be identified. Critical stormwater facilities, as so deemed by the director, may require a more frequent inspection schedule. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.150.270 Enforcement.

20.160.050 Designation of responsible official. 

(1) For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the director. 

(2) For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS) and perform any other functions assigned to the “lead agency” or “responsible official” by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.060 Lead agency determination and responsibilities. 

(1) The SEPA responsible official shall determine the lead agency for any application for or initiation of a proposal that involves a nonexempt action, as provided in WAC 197-11-050, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or if another agency is in the process of determining the lead agency. 

(2) When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the SEPA responsible official shall supervise compliance with the necessary threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS. 

(3) When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

(4) If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by any other agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the Department of Ecology for lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by the director. 

(5) Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement. 

(6) Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.070 Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the city’s responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city’s responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.080 Categorical exemptions – Adoption by reference.

The city adopts the following rules for categorical exemptions from Chapter 197-11 WAC: 

WAC

197-11-300    Purpose of this part.

197-11-305    Categorical exemptions.

197-11-800    Categorical exemptions.

197-11-880    Emergencies.

197-11-890    Petitioning DOE to change exemptions.

(Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.090 Categorical exemptions – Determination. 

(1) Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal, shall determine whether the license, permit and/or proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and is not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal. 

(2) In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain that the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-070). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt. 

(3) If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that: 

(a) The city shall not give authorization for:

(i) Any nonexempt action;

(ii) Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or 

(iii) Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives. 

(b) The department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if the nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and 

(c) A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if the nonexempt actions were not approved. 

The city will normally identify whether an action is categorically exempt within 30 days of receiving a completed application. The director shall certify when an application is complete based upon review of the environmental checklist, or for project permit applications, based on the requirements for a complete application set forth in the city’s code for each permit type. If additional information is required to supplement the checklist, the application shall not be certified complete until the required information is received by the director. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.100 Integration of SEPA with project permits and land use decisions.

Under Chapter 36.70B RCW, the procedure for review and processing of project permit applications shall be combined with the environmental review process, both procedural and substantive. The process under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and this chapter shall integrate the following procedures, insofar as possible, with any applicable process for decision-making on permit and land use applications: 

(1) Staff review of the application under city codes and regulations and the environmental review and determination thereon;

(2) The staff report on the application, and the report or documentation concerning environmental review;

(3) Hearings and other public processes, including required public notices, required by city code or regulation, and hearings and other public processes, including public notices and appeals, required or conducted under SEPA;

(4) Such other review processes as determined by the director. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.110 Threshold determinations.

This part contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a “probable, significant, adverse environmental impact” requiring an environmental impact statement to be prepared. This part also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference, as supplemented in this part:

WAC

197-11-310    Threshold determination required.

197-11-315    Environmental checklist.

197-11-330    Threshold determination process.

197-11-335    Additional information.

197-11-340    Determination of significance (DS).

197-11-350    Mitigated DNS.

197-11-355    Optional DNS process.

197-11-360    Determination of significance (DS) (initiation of scoping).

197-11-390    Effect of threshold determination.

(Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.120 Environmental checklist. 

(1) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter, except that a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree that an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency, and if the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determinations. 

(2) For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal. 

(3) The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs: 

(a) The city has technical information on a question or questions that are unavailable to the private applicant; or 

(b) The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.

(4) For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the city shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with or as part of a planned action ordinance; or developed after the ordinance is adopted. In either case, a proposed modified environmental checklist form must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a 30-day review prior to use. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.130 Timing.

For those project permit applications that are not subject to Chapter 36.70B RCW, the following will apply: 

(1) The city will attempt to issue a threshold determination on a completed application within 90 days after the application and supporting documentation are complete. 

(2) A complete application for a threshold determination consists of the following information: 

(a) A description of the proposed action;

(b) Site information, including site plans, vicinity maps and other information required for a land use certification or other application;

(c) The environmental checklist;

(d) Additional information/environmental checklist (WAC 197-11-335). The environmental checklist covers 16 subjects. If, after review of the environmental checklist, it is determined that there is insufficient information to make a threshold determination, additional information will be required using any one or more of the following: 

(i) The applicant will provide more information on subjects in the checklist;

(ii) The city makes its own further study;

(iii) The city will consult with other agencies, requesting information on the proposal’s probable or potential impacts which lie within the other agency’s jurisdiction or expertise. 

(3) It is the policy of the city that adequate information must be provided before a threshold decision can be made. The city will not commence processing environmental checklists which are not complete. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.160.140 Mitigated DNS. 

(1) As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant. 

(2) An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

(a) Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and 

(b) Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal. 

(3) The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 30 working days. The response shall: 

(a) Be written; 

(b) State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and

(c) State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

(4) As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures. 

(5) When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal.

(a) If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2). 

(b) If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate. 

(c) The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent stormwater runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location” are adequate. 

(d) Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents. 

(6) A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice. 

(7) Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city. 

(8) If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS). 

(9) The city’s written response under subsection (3) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

A written decision will issue if the appeal is untimely and the appeal will not proceed. 

(12) Hearing Examiner Appeals. 

(a) Jurisdiction. All administrative appeals relating to project permit applications or any type of quasi-judicial or ministerial development applications that are not appealable to the city council (pursuant to Chapter 20.24 POMC) shall be heard by the hearing examiner.

20.162.010 Title.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the city of Port Orchard’s “critical areas ordinance” or “CAO.” (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.012 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the city’s comprehensive plan and the Washington State Growth Management Act to protect critical areas, the environment, human life, and property from harm and degradation in accordance with the Growth Management Act through the application of best available science, as determined according to WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925 and RCW 36.70A.172, and in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.014 Applicability.

Except as provided for otherwise herein, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to all persons and agencies, public or private, engaging in land uses, building, and/or development activity in the city of Port Orchard that requires city approval. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.016 Relationship to other regulations.

(1) Nothing in this chapter in any way limits, or may be construed to limit, the authority of the city under any other applicable law, nor in any way decreases the responsibility of the applicant to comply with all other applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

(2) These critical areas regulations shall apply as an overlay and in addition to land use, development, building, and other regulations adopted by the city.

(3) When any provision of any other chapter of the POMC conflicts with this chapter or when the provisions of this chapter are in conflict, that provision which provides more protection to environmentally critical areas shall apply unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter or unless such provision conflicts with federal or state laws or regulations. 

(4) Compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required. The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the regulations established in this chapter.

(5) Where critical areas occur within the city’s shoreline jurisdiction as established by the city’s shoreline master program (Chapter 20.164 POMC), they are regulated under the regulations and provisions of the shoreline master program. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.018 Inventory provisions.

(1) The approximate location and extent of mapped critical areas within the city are shown on the maps adopted as part of this chapter, and incorporated herein by this reference. These maps shall be used only as a general guide for the assistance of the department and the public; for a specific development or use proposal, the type, extent and boundaries shall be determined in the field by a qualified specialist or staff person according to the requirements of this chapter. In the event of a conflict between a critical area location shown on the city’s maps and that of an on-site determination, the on-site determination shall apply.

(2) Future Inventory Provisions. The city will review map inventory information of all critical areas as it becomes available or on an annual basis. Mapping will include critical areas that are identified through site-specific analysis by local, state and federal agencies, tribal governments, site-specific environmental reports and other sources. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.020 Administration – Generally.

(1) The director, or his/her authorized designee, shall administer and interpret the provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise specifically provided. The director shall determine whether building, development, platting, or alteration of vegetation, trees, or habitat is subject to this chapter. The director may also consult with other city departments and state and federal agencies as necessary to obtain additional technical and environmental review assistance. The director is authorized to adopt such administrative rules and regulations as are necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this chapter.

(2) This chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. It is not the intent of this chapter to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable economic use of the property nor to prevent the provision of public facilities and services necessary to support existing development.

(3) The approvals granted under this chapter shall be valid for the same time period as the underlying permit (e.g., preliminary plat, building permit, etc.). If the underlying permit does not contain a specified expiration date, then approvals granted under this chapter shall be valid for a period of three years from the date of issue, unless a longer or shorter period is specified by the director.

(4) If an activity is subject to this chapter but is not subject to any established city permit or approval, the proponent shall obtain written authorization from the director prior to commencement to ensure compliance with this chapter. Such authorization shall be processed as a Type I land use decision pursuant to Chapter 20.22 POMC. 

(5) Nothing in this chapter in any way limits, or may be construed to limit, the authority of the city under any other applicable law, nor in any way decreases the responsibility of the applicant to comply with all other applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.022 Application requirements – Generally.

(1) Where not otherwise required, all applicants are encouraged to meet with the department prior to submitting an application subject to this title. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the city’s zoning and applicable critical area requirements, to review any conceptual site plans prepared by the applicant and to identify potential impacts and mitigation measures. Such conference shall be for the convenience of the applicant and any recommendations shall not be binding on the applicant or the city.

(2) To expedite the permit review process, the department shall be the lead agency on all work related to critical areas. Development may be prohibited in a proposed development site based on criteria set forth in this chapter; the applicant should first determine whether this is the case before applying for permits from the department.

(3) Application for development proposals, reasonable use exceptions, or variances regulated by this chapter, or for review of special environmental reports, shall be made with the department by the property owner, lessee, contract purchaser, other person entitled to possession of the property, or by an authorized agent.

(4) All site plan applications for development proposals subject to this chapter shall include a site plan drawn to scale identifying locations of critical areas and any associated buffers, location of proposed structures and activities, including clearing and grading and general topographic information as required by the department. If the department determines that additional critical areas are found on the subject property, the applicant shall amend the site plan to identify the location of the critical area. 

(5) A fee in an amount established by the city’s fee schedule shall be paid at the time an application for a permit relating to a critical area or a special report review is filed. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.024 Application requirements – Mitigation sequencing.

(1) Applicants shall demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been examined with the intent to avoid and minimize impacts to critical areas. When alteration to a critical area is proposed, such alteration shall be avoided, minimized, or compensated in the following order of preference:

(a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

(b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps, such as project redesign, relocation, or timing, to avoid or reduce impacts;

(c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment to the conditions existing at the time of the initiation of the project;

(d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

(e) Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and

(f) Monitoring the impact and the compensation project and taking appropriate corrective measures when necessary.

(2) Mitigation measures may be required to address potential impacts that are identified through the sequencing listed above. Mitigation shall be consistent with the requirements of Article XII of this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.026 Application requirements – Review criteria.

(1) Applications for any development proposal subject to the critical areas ordinance shall be reviewed by the director for completeness and consistency or inconsistency with this chapter.

(2) The director may withhold, condition, or deny land use, building, and/or development permits or activity approvals to ensure that the proposed action is consistent with this chapter. In evaluating a request for a development proposal regulated by this chapter, it shall be the responsibility of the director to determine the following: 

(a) The nature and type of critical area and the adequacy of any special reports required in applicable sections of this chapter;

(b) Whether the development proposal is consistent with this chapter, by granting, denying, or conditioning projects;

(c) Whether proposed alterations to critical areas are appropriate under the standards contained in this chapter, or whether it is necessary for the applicant to seek a variance or other exception; and

(d) If the protection mechanisms and the mitigation and monitoring plans and bonding measures proposed by the applicant are sufficient to protect the public health, safety and welfare consistent with the purpose and regulations contained in this chapter, and if so, condition the permit or approval accordingly.

(3) At every stage of the application process, the burden of demonstrating that any proposed development is consistent with this chapter is upon the applicant. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.028 Bonds. 

(1) All bonds and acceptable securities guaranteeing compliance with this chapter shall be set in the amount of 150 percent of the average expected value of the project. The value of the bond shall be based on the engineer’s estimate of the subject work. If the applicant and director do not agree to the engineer’s estimate, then the bond shall be based on the average of three contract bids that establish all costs of compensation, including costs relative to performance, monitoring, maintenance, and provision for contingency plans. 

(2) Performance Bonds. Except for public agencies, applicants receiving a land use, development, or building permit or approval subject to the provisions of this chapter are required to post a cash performance bond or other acceptable security to guarantee compliance with this chapter prior to beginning any site work. The surety shall guarantee that work and materials used in construction are free from defects. All bonds shall be approved by the city attorney. The surety or bonds cannot be terminated or canceled without written approval. The director shall release the bond after documented proof that all structures and improvements have been shown to meet the requirements of this chapter and that a maintenance bond has been posted, if required. 

(3) Maintenance Bonds. Except for public agencies, an applicant shall be required to post a cash maintenance bond or other acceptable security guaranteeing that structures and improvements required by this chapter will perform satisfactorily for a minimum of three years after they have been constructed and approved. All bonds shall be on a form approved by the city attorney. Without written release, the bond cannot be canceled or terminated. The director shall release the bond after determination that the performance standards established for measuring the effectiveness and success of the project have been met. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.030 Notice to title.

The director shall require an applicant to file a “critical area and buffer notice to title” on a form approved by the city with the Kitsap County auditor for all properties included in land use and development proposals subject to the provisions of this chapter and containing critical areas and/or their buffers. Such notice shall be a covenant that runs with the land in perpetuity and include identification of the boundaries of the critical areas and/or their buffers and any permanent conditions imposed by the city. The covenant shall be recorded prior to the issuance of any permit or at the time a short plat or final plat is recorded. This notice shall serve as an official notice to subsequent landowners that the land owner is responsible for complying with existing conditions for development or use as established by this chapter and any city, state, or federal permits or other approvals, and shall accept sole responsibility for any risk associated with the land’s identified critical area. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.032 Exemptions. 

(1) An exemption means that an activity is fully exempt from critical areas review and not subject to the provisions of this chapter. An exemption from this chapter is not an endorsement to degrade a critical area; ignore risk from natural hazards; or otherwise limit the ability of the director to identify and abate such actions that may cause degradation to a critical area. All exempted activities shall use best management practices to the greatest possible extent to avoid potential impacts to critical areas. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area or its buffer that is not a necessary and unavoidable outcome of the exempted activity shall be mitigated through restoration, rehabilitation and/or replacement at the responsible party’s expense.

(2) The proponent of the activity may submit a written request for exemption to the director that describes the activity and states the exemption listed in this section that applies. The director shall review the request to verify that it complies with this chapter and approve or deny the exemption as a Type I administrative determination pursuant to Chapter 20.22 POMC. 

(3) The following land use, development, building activities, and associated uses shall be exempt:

(a) Emergencies. Emergency activities are those activities necessary to prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, or that pose an immediate risk of damage to property and that require remedial or preventative action in a short time frame. The person or agency undertaking such action shall notify the city and the director shall determine if the action taken is within the scope of the emergency action allowed in this section. After the emergency, the person or agency shall fully restore and/or mitigate any impacts to the critical areas and buffers resulting from the action in accordance with an approved critical area report and mitigation plan. 

(b) Operation Maintenance or Repair. Operation maintenance or repair of existing structures not requiring permits or city approval, only if the activity does not further alter or increase the impact to critical areas or their buffers. 

(c) Passive Outdoor Activities. Recreation, education, and scientific research activities that do not degrade the critical area. 

(d) Forest Practices. Forest practices regulated and conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 76.09 RCW and forest practices regulations, WAC Title 222. When a proposed forest activity has been classified as a Class IV forest practice for a conversion of forest land to another use, or when a forest activity requiring a forest practices application is located within the city’s urban growth area, it shall be subject to the regulations and provisions of this chapter.

(e) Existing Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair. Maintenance and repair of legally existing roads, utilities, infrastructure, and associated facilities. 

(f) Activities within the Improved Right-of-Way. Construction of new utility facilities, improvements, or upgrades to existing utility facilities that take place within existing improved rights-of-way or existing impervious surfaces that do not increase the amount of impervious surface. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.034 Exceptions. 

An exception means that an activity is subject to the provisions of this chapter and must undergo full critical areas review but may receive special consideration and relief from certain provisions of this chapter. The following are identified exceptions to the provisions of this chapter:

(1) Public Agencies. Public agencies may make an application for exception to the director for construction of items such as new roads, utilities, infrastructure, and associated facilities. The application shall include critical area identification; a critical area report, including a mitigation plan if necessary; and any other related project documents such as environmental documents pursuant to SEPA, Chapter 43.21C RCW. The decision whether to grant the public agency utility exception from provisions of this chapter shall be processed as a Type III land use decision per Chapter 20.22 POMC pursuant to the following review criteria:

(a) There is no other practical alternative to the proposed development with less impact on the critical areas; and

(b) The application of this chapter would unreasonably restrict the ability to provide utility services to the public. 

(2) Reasonable Use. An applicant may apply for a reasonable use exception if it can be demonstrated that application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the subject property. The application shall include critical areas identification; a critical areas report including a mitigation plan, if necessary; and any other related project documents such as environmental documents and special studies. The decision whether to grant the reasonable use exception shall be processed as a Type III land use decision per Chapter 20.22 POMC pursuant to the following review criteria:

(a) The application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property;

(b) No other reasonable use of the property has less impact on the critical area;

(c) Any alteration is the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property; and

(d) The inability of the applicant to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant after the effective date of this chapter or its predecessor. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.036 Variances.

(1) Except when application of this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property, an applicant who seeks an exception from the standards and requirements of the CAO shall pursue relief by means of a variance as provided for in this section.

(2) A variance in the application of the regulations, standards, or use prohibitions of this chapter to a particular property may be granted by the director when it can be shown that the application meets all of the following criteria:

(a) Because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, or topography, the strict application of this chapter is found to deprive subject property of rights and privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity; provided, however, the fact that those surrounding properties have been developed under regulations in force prior to the adoption of this chapter shall not be the sole basis for the granting of a variance; 

(b) The special circumstances referred to in subsection (1)(a) of this section are not the result of the actions of the current or previous owner(s);

(c) The granting of the variance will not result in substantial detrimental impacts to the critical area, public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and area in which the property is situated or contrary to the goals, policies and purpose of this chapter;

(d) The granting of the variance is the minimum necessary to accommodate the permitted use;

(e) No other practicable or reasonable alternative exists; and

(f) A mitigation plan (where required) has been submitted and is approved for the proposed use of the critical area.

(3) A variance application under this chapter shall be processed as a Type III land use decision pursuant to Chapter 20.22 POMC. 

(4) Requests for variances shall include the requirements of Articles VIII and IX of this chapter regarding critical areas reports and habitat plans, as applicable to the proposed activity or use.

(5) The department shall review administrative variances based on the criteria and standards referenced in this chapter and the procedures in Subtitle II of this title, Permitting and Development Approval. 

(6) The department may grant administrative variances for public utilities to the substantive or procedural requirements of the CAO when:

(a) Application of the CAO to the utility’s activities would be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan or the utility’s public service obligations;

(b) The proposed utility activity does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety or welfare on or off the development proposal site; and

(c) Any alterations permitted to these critical areas shall be the minimum necessary to reasonably accommodate the proposed utility activity and mitigate when feasible. 

(7) The applicant for a variance is responsible for complying with all state and federal regulations that may apply to the proposed activity, whether or not a variance for CAO requirements is granted by the city. State and federal permits will be required for certain activities in critical areas, including but not limited to in-water or wetland work. All other relevant city permit and regulatory requirements shall also be met for the proposed activity. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.038 Nonconforming – Existing structures. 

(1) Existing Structures. Structures in existence on the date the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective, and which were lawfully constructed, that do not meet the setback or buffer requirements of this chapter may be remodeled or reconstructed; provided, that the new construction or related activity does not further intrude into or create additional impacts to the critical area or its associated buffers and is subject to the restrictions of Chapter 20.170 POMC, Flood Damage Prevention, for reconstruction; provided further, that reconstruction or remodeling will only be allowed if it does not create or continue a circumstance where personal or property damage is likely due to the nature of the critical area.

(2) Where projects have been approved with conditions to protect critical areas under previous protection policies in effect prior to the adoption of this chapter, those conditions will apply unless and until an alteration, expansion or other change in development or use will result in a detrimental impact to a critical area or its buffer. The provisions of this chapter shall also apply in cases where the department determines, based on review of current information, that the prior conditions will result in a detrimental impact to a critical area or its buffer. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.040 Enforcement – Violation – Penalty.

All development work shall remain stopped until a restoration plan is prepared at the expense of the owner or violator and approved by the city. The plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional using the best available science and shall describe how the actions proposed meet the minimum requirements described in this chapter. The director may, at the owner or violator’s expense, seek expert advice in determining the adequacy of the plan. Inadequate plans shall be returned to the owner or violator for revision and resubmittal. If work is not completed in a reasonable time following the order, the city may implement a process to restore or enhance the affected site. This includes creation of new wetlands or streams to offset loss as a result of violation of the provisions in this chapter. The violator shall be liable for all costs of such action, including administrative costs. 

(d) The enforcement provisions of this chapter apply to all activities exempted under this chapter. The director’s determination that a violation exists is not limited by determinations made by other city agencies or public agencies.

Article III. Wetlands


20.162.046 Purpose. 

This article applies to all regulated uses within or adjacent to areas designated as wetlands, as categorized below. The intent of this article is to:

(1) Achieve no net loss and increase the quality and function of wetland acreage, functions and values within the city. Mitigation measures, as conditions of permits, must have a reasonable expectation of success. Under the conditions of this article, the department may deny development proposals that would irreparably impact regulated wetlands;

(2) Protect the public expenditures that could arise from improper wetland uses and activities;

(3) Plan wetland uses and activities in a manner that allows property holders to benefit from wetland property ownership wherever allowable under the conditions of this article and the other provisions of the critical areas ordinance;

(4) Preserve natural flood control, stormwater storage and drainage or stream flow patterns; and

(5) Prevent turbidity and pollution of wetlands, and fish or shellfish bearing waters to maintain the wildlife habitat. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.048 Wetland categories.

(1) Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, estuaries, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

For regulatory purposes, wetland delineations shall be determined in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. All areas within the city meeting the wetland designation criteria as determined by that review procedure are designated as critical areas and are subject to the regulations and provisions of this chapter. 

(2) The city uses the Department of Ecology’s Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029), or as amended hereafter to categorize wetlands for the purposes of establishing wetland buffer widths, wetland uses and replacement ratios for wetlands. This system consists of four wetland categories (see Article XIII of this chapter, Attachment A, for wetland categories). (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.050 Exempt wetlands.

(1) All wetlands within the city meeting the definition in POMC 20.162.048 are regulated. The following wetlands may be exempt from the requirement to avoid impacts, and they may be filled if the impacts are fully mitigated based on the requirements of this chapter. If available, impacts should be mitigated through the purchase of credits from an in-lieu fee program or mitigation bank, consistent with the terms and conditions of the program or bank. In order to verify the following conditions, a critical area report for wetlands meeting the requirements of this chapter must be submitted.

(a) All isolated Category IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet that:

(i) Are not associated with riparian areas or their buffers.

(ii) Are not associated with shorelines of the state or their associated buffers.

(iii) Are not part of a wetland mosaic.

(iv) Do not score five or more points for habitat function based on the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised as approved by Ecology).

(v) Do not contain a priority habitat or a priority area for a priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat, or species of local importance.

(b) Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet that meet the above criteria and do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions contained in this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.052 Development standards.

For the purpose of the provisions of the critical areas ordinance, a regulated wetland and its buffer is a critical area.

(1) There shall be no activity allowed within a regulated wetland or its buffer unless specifically allowed by this chapter.

(2) Buffers. Buffers shall remain undisturbed natural vegetation areas except where the buffer can be enhanced to improve its functional attributes. Any buffer enhancement and/or limited view clearing activity must be reviewed and approved by the department. No refuse shall be placed in the buffer.

(3) Buffer Widths. All regulated wetlands shall be surrounded by a buffer zone as follows based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (in accordance with Department of Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029):

(a) For wetlands that score five points or more for habitat function, the buffers in Table 1 can be used if both of the following criteria are met: 

(i) A relatively undisturbed, vegetated corridor at least 100 feet wide is protected between the wetland and any other priority habitats as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. The corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat by some type of legal protection such as a conservation easement. Presence or absence of a nearby habitat must be confirmed by a qualified biologist. If no option for providing a corridor is available, Table 1 may be used with the required measures in Table 2 alone.

(ii) The measures in Table 2 are implemented, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses. 

(b) For wetlands that score three to four habitat points, only the measures in Table 2 are required for the use of Table 1. 

(c) If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 2, or is unable to provide a protected corridor where available, then Table 3 must be used.

(d) The buffer widths in Table 1 and Table 3 assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

(4) Buffer Measurement. All buffers shall be measured on a horizontal plane from the regulated wetland edge as marked in the field.

(5) Buffer Averaging. Standard buffer widths may be modified by averaging buffer widths. The total area contained within the buffer after averaging shall be no less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging. The buffer shall not be reduced by more than 25 percent of the standard buffer width at any point. The department may allow wetland buffer averaging where it can be demonstrated that such averaging can clearly provide equivalent or greater functions and values as would be provided under the standard buffer requirement. 

Prior to approval of buffer averaging, a critical areas report for wetland meeting the requirements in this chapter must be submitted. Averaging of buffer widths may be allowed where the applicant demonstrates the following:

(a) The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics; and

(b) Averaging is necessary to avoid an extraordinary hardship to the applicant caused by circumstances peculiar to the property.

(6) Increased Buffer Provisions. The department may increase buffer zone widths for a development project on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values. Such determination shall be based on site-specific and project related conditions, which include, but are not limited to: 

(a) Wetland sites with known locations of endangered or threatened species for which a habitat management plan indicates a larger buffer is necessary to protect habitat values for such species; 

(b) The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures alone will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; 

(c) The adjacent land on the development proposal site has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than 30 percent; or 

(d) The proposed development within 200 feet of the regulated wetland would be a high intensity use.

(7) Fencing and Signs. This subsection applies to those wetlands and their buffers that are within 200 feet of regulated development activities.

(a) Wetland buffers shall be temporarily fenced or otherwise suitably marked, as required by the department, between the area where the construction activity occurs and the buffer. Fences shall be made of a durable protective barrier and shall be highly visible. Silt fences and plastic construction fences may be used to prevent encroachment on wetlands or their buffers by construction. Temporary fencing shall be removed after the site work has been completed and the site is fully stabilized per city approval. 

(b) The department may require permanent signs and/or split-rail fencing to be placed on the common boundary between a wetland buffer and the adjacent land. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot if the lot is less than 50 feet wide, or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The signs shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the department:

Protected Wetland Area Do Not Disturb Contact City of Port Orchard Regarding Uses, Restrictions, and Opportunities for Stewardship

The department may approve an alternate method of wetland and buffer identification, if it provides adequate protection to the wetland and buffer.

(8) Building or Impervious Surface Setback Lines. A building or impervious surface setback line of 15 feet is required from the edge of any wetland buffer. Minor structural or impervious surface intrusions into the areas of the setback may be permitted if the department determines that such intrusions will not adversely impact the wetland. The setback shall be identified on a site plan and filed as an attachment to the notice to title as required by POMC 20.162.030, Notice to title. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.054 Regulated uses and activities.

Major and minor new development activities on properties containing regulated wetlands and buffers are subject to the development standards in this chapter, as permitted in the underlying zoning designation. All authorized uses and activities in a regulated wetland or its buffer shall be subject to conditions established by the department and may be subject to mitigation as required by this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.056 Additional development standards for regulated uses.

In addition to meeting the development standards in this article, those regulated uses identified below shall also comply with the standards of this section and other applicable state, federal and local ordinances.

(1) Forest Practice, Class IV General, and Conversion Option Harvest Plans (COHPs). All timber harvesting and associated development activity, such as construction of roads, shall comply with the provisions of the critical areas ordinance, including the maintenance of buffers around regulated wetlands.

(2) Agricultural Restrictions. In all development proposals which would permit introduction of agricultural uses, damage to regulated wetlands shall be avoided. Wetlands shall be avoided by one of the following methods:

(a) Implementation of a farm conservation plan agreed upon by the conservation district and the applicant to protect and enhance the water quality of the wetland; and/or

(b) Fencing located not closer than the outer buffer edge.

(3) Road/Street Repair and Maintenance. Any private or public road or street repair or maintenance shall comply with the following minimum development standards:

(a) The road or street repair and construction are the minimum necessary to provide safe roads and streets;

(b) Mitigation shall be performed in accordance with specific project mitigation plan requirements.

(4) Land Divisions and Land Use Permits. All proposed divisions of land and land uses (including but not limited to the following: boundary or lot line adjustments, short plats, large lot subdivisions, master planned resorts, planned residential developments, conditional use permits, site plan reviews, binding site plans) which include regulated wetlands shall comply with the following procedures and development standards:

(a) Regulated wetlands, except the area with permanent open water, and wetland buffers may be included in the calculation of minimum lot area for proposed lots; provided, that other standards, including subsection (5)(c) of this section, are met.

(b) Land division approvals shall be conditioned to require that regulated wetlands and regulated wetland buffers be dedicated as open space tracts, or an easement or covenant encumbering the wetland and wetland buffer. Such dedication, easement or covenant shall be recorded together with the land division and represented on the final plat, short plat or binding site plan, and title.

(c) In order to implement the goals and policies of the provisions of this chapter, to accommodate innovation, creativity, and design flexibility, and to achieve a level of environmental protection that would not be possible by typical lot-by-lot development, the use of the clustered development or similar innovative site planning is strongly encouraged for projects with regulated wetlands on the site.

(d) After preliminary approval and prior to final land division approval, the department may require the common boundary between a regulated wetland or associated buffer and the adjacent land be identified using permanent signs and/or fencing. In lieu of signs and/or fencing, alternative methods of wetland and buffer identification may be approved when such methods are determined by the department to provide adequate protection to the wetland and buffer.

(5) Stormwater Management Facilities. A wetland or its buffer can be physically or hydrologically altered to meet the requirements of an LID, runoff treatment or flow control BMP if all of the following criteria are met: 

(a) The wetland is classified as a Category IV or a Category III wetland with a habitat score of 3 to 4 points; and 

(b) There will be “no net loss” of functions and values of the wetland; and 

(c) The wetland does not contain a breeding population of any native amphibian species; and 

(d) The hydrologic functions of the wetland can be improved as outlined in questions 3, 4, 5 of Chart 4 and questions 2, 3, 4 of Chart 5 in the Department of Ecology’s “Guide for Selecting Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach”; or the wetland is part of a priority restoration plan that achieves restoration goals identified in a shoreline master program or other local or regional watershed plan; and 

(e) The wetland lies in the natural routing of the runoff, and the discharge follows the natural routing; and 

(f) All regulations regarding stormwater and wetland management are followed, including but not limited to local and state wetland and stormwater codes, manuals, and permits; and 

(g) Modifications that alter the structure of a wetland or its soils will require permits. Existing functions and values that are lost would have to be compensated/replaced. 

Stormwater LID BMPs required as part of new and redevelopment projects can be considered within wetlands and their buffers. A site-specific characterization is required to determine if an LID BMP is feasible at the project site.

(6) Trails and Trail-Related Facilities. Construction of public and private trails and trail-related facilities, such as benches and viewing platforms, may be allowed in wetlands or wetland buffers pursuant to the following guidelines:

(a) Trails and related facilities shall, to the extent feasible, be placed on existing road grades, utility corridors, or any other previously disturbed areas.

(b) Trails and related facilities shall be planned to minimize removal of trees, soil disturbance and existing hydrological characteristics, shrubs, snags and important wildlife habitat.

(c) Viewing platforms and benches, and access to them, shall be designed and located to minimize disturbance of wildlife habitat and/or critical characteristics of the affected wetland.

(d) Trails and related facilities shall generally be located outside required buffers. Where trails are permitted within buffers they shall be located in the outer 25 percent of the buffer and a minimum of 25 feet from the wetland edge, except where wetland crossings or viewing areas have been approved.

(e) Trails shall generally be limited to pedestrian use and pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width, unless other more intensive uses, such as bike or horse trails, have been specifically allowed and mitigation has been provided.

(f) Circular (loop) trails are discouraged, as they have the potential to encircle critical areas and cut off habitat connectivity for smaller species. 

(7) Utilities in Wetlands or Wetland Buffers.

(a) Construction of new utilities outside the road right-of-way or existing utility corridors may be permitted in wetlands or wetland buffers, only when no reasonable alternative location is available and the utility corridor meets the requirements for installation, replacement of vegetation and maintenance outlined below, and as required in the filing and approval of applicable permits and special reports required by this chapter.

(b) Sewer or On-Site Sewage Utility. Construction of sewer lines or on-site sewage systems may be permitted in regulated wetland buffers only when:

(i) The applicant demonstrates it is necessary to meet state and/or local health code minimum design standards (not requiring a variance for either horizontal setback or vertical separation); and/or 

(ii) There are no other practicable or reasonable alternatives available and construction meets the requirements of this section. Joint use of the sewer utility corridor by other utilities may be allowed. Special use review according to the requirements of this chapter will be required when such activities occur in wetland buffers.

(c) New utility corridors shall not be allowed when the regulated wetland or buffer has known locations of federal or state listed endangered, threatened or sensitive species, heron rookeries or nesting sites of raptors which are listed as state candidate or state monitor, except in those circumstances where an approved habitat management plan indicates that the utility corridor will not significantly impact the wetland or wetland buffer.

(d) New utility corridor construction and maintenance shall protect the regulated wetland and buffer environment by utilizing the following methods: 

(i) New utility corridors shall be aligned when possible to avoid cutting trees greater than 12 inches in diameter at breast height (four and one-half feet), measured on the uphill side.

(ii) New utility corridors shall be revegetated with appropriate native vegetation at preconstruction densities or greater, immediately upon completion of construction, or as soon thereafter as possible, if due to seasonal growing constraints. The utility shall ensure that such vegetation survives.

(iii) Any additional utility corridor access for maintenance shall be provided as much as possible at specific points, rather than by parallel roads. If parallel roads are necessary, they shall be of a minimum width but no greater than 15 feet; and shall be contiguous to the location of the utility corridor on the side away from the wetland. Mitigation will be required for any additional access through restoration of vegetation in disturbed areas.

(iv) The department may require other additional mitigation measures.

(e) Utility corridor maintenance shall include the following measures to protect the regulated wetland and buffer environment:

(i) Where feasible, painting of utility equipment such as power towers shall not be sprayed or sandblasted, nor should lead-based paints be used.

(ii) No pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers may be used in wetland areas or their buffers except those approved by the EPA and Ecology. Where approved, herbicides must be applied by a licensed applicator in accordance with the safe application practices on the label. Within wetlands, the applicator must be licensed to use aquatic herbicides.

(f) For utility work in wetlands or in-water, it shall be the applicant’s responsibility to obtain all necessary state and federal approvals before beginning work. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.058 Application requirements.

(1) Application Procedures for New Development. Any new development containing a regulated wetland or its buffer, or within 200 feet of a regulated wetland or its buffer, shall provide the following special reports, as required by the department, prior to any development authorization by the city. If an environmentally sensitive area is within 200 feet of the parcel but not on the parcel, every effort should be made to obtain the required information. The department may require additional reports or information to further identify potential impacts to any part of the environment:

(a) Wetland report;

(b) Wetland mitigation plan; and

(c) Erosion and sedimentation control measures and/or a stormwater or land disturbing activity permit as required by the city’s stormwater management regulations. (Ord. 010-18 § 28; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.060 Determination of wetland boundaries.

(1) The determination of the wetland edge or boundary shall be done in accordance with the delineation methodology specified in the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. All areas within the city meeting the wetland designation criteria as determined by that procedure are designated as critical areas and are subject to the provisions and regulations of this chapter. 

(2) The applicant shall be responsible for hiring a qualified wetland specialist to determine the wetland boundaries through a field survey. This specialist shall stake or flag the wetland boundary. For all new development, as required by the department, this line shall be surveyed by a professional land surveyor licensed in the state of Washington. The regulated wetland boundary and regulated wetland buffer shall be identified on all grading, landscaping, site, on-site septic system designs (BSAs), utility or other development plans submitted in support of the project.

(3) The department may perform a delineation of a wetland boundary on parcels where no more than one single-family dwelling unit is allowed.

(4) Where the applicant has provided a delineation of a wetland boundary, the department may verify the wetland boundary at the cost of the applicant and may request that adjustments to the boundary be made by a wetland specialist. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.062 Wetland mitigation requirements.

(1) Mitigation Sequence. Projects permitted under this article will be reviewed in accordance with the mitigation sequencing requirement in POMC 20.162.104.

(2) Mitigation Plan Requirements. Any applicant required to perform compensatory wetland mitigation as a condition of approval for a development project shall submit a wetlands mitigation plan to the department in accordance with POMC 20.162.096. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans – Version 1 (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b or as revised), and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Ecology Publication No. 09-06-32), and with amended Appendix 8-C to Wetlands in Washington State Volume 2 – Protecting and Managing Wetlands (Ecology Publication 05-06-008 or as revised). 

(3) Wetland Replacement Ratios. The following ratios, as well as consideration of the factors listed in this section, and Table 4, shall be used to determine the appropriate amounts of restored, rehabilitated, created, or enhanced wetland that will be required to replace impacted wetlands. The first number specifies the amount of wetland area requiring replacement and the second specifies the amount of wetland area altered.

 

Table 4 – Wetland Replacement Ratios  

	Category and Type of Impact Wetland	Restoration or Creation	Rehabilitation	Enhancement Only

	Category I:

Bog, natural heritage site	Not considered possible	Case-by-case	Case-by-case

	Category I:

Mature forested	6:1	12:1	24:1

	Category I:

(All others)	4:1	8:1	16:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	12:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	8:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	6:1

(a) Open water may be enhanced by replacing structures that may have been removed in the past (large woody material, rocks, reefs, etc.).

(b) The department may increase the ratios based on one or more of the following:

(i) The probable success of the proposed restoration or enhancement;

(ii) The period of time between destruction and replication of wetland functions;

(iii) Projected losses in functions and value;

(iv) Replacement as a result of an illegal action.

(4) Alternative Mitigation Ratios. The department may approve different mitigation ratios when the applicant proposes a combination of wetland creation, restoration, rehabilitation, and/or enhancement; provided, that federal and state resource agencies approve the mitigation plan and the plan achieves no net loss of wetland functions and values. Mitigation requirements may also be determined using the credit/debit tool described in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, or as revised) if approved by the director.

(5) Monitoring Requirements. The city shall require monitoring reports on an annual basis for a minimum of five years, or until the department determines that the mitigation project has achieved success. Certain types of wetland communities, such as scrub-shrub or forested wetland, require additional time for establishment and may require monitoring for 10 or more years depending on the site-specific circumstances and the scope of the mitigation project. The wetlands mitigation plan shall provide specific criteria for monitoring the mitigation project. Criteria shall be project-specific and a scientifically acceptable means to aid the department in evaluating whether or not the project has achieved success according to the wetland mitigation performance standards in this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.064 Incentives for wetlands protection.

The city of Port Orchard recognizes that property owners wish to gain economic benefits from their land. The city encourages such mechanisms as the open space tax program, conservation easements and donations to land trusts, in order to provide taxation relief upon compliance with the regulations in the provisions of the critical areas ordinance. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article IV. Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas


20.162.068 Purpose.

This article applies to all regulated uses included in the critical areas ordinance, or uses within 200 feet of areas designated as fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, as categorized in POMC 20.162.070. The intent of this article is to: 

(1) Preserve natural flood control, stormwater storage and drainage or stream flow patterns;

(2) Control siltation, protect nutrient reserves and maintain stream flows and stream quality for fish and marine shellfish;

(3) Prevent turbidity and pollution of streams and fish or shellfish bearing waters;

(4) Preserve and protect habitat adequate to support viable populations of native wildlife in both the city and Kitsap County; and

(5) Encourage nonregulatory methods of habitat retention whenever practical, through education and the open space tax program. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.070 Fish and wildlife habitat conservation area categories classification. 

The following categories shall be used in classifying fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas that are located within the city’s shoreline jurisdiction according to the city’s shoreline master program are regulated through the provisions of this chapter.

(1) Streams. All streams which meet the criteria for Type F/2, Np/3, Ns/4 and 5 waters as set forth in the DNR water rating system (see Table 5).

(2) Lakes Less Than 20 Acres in Surface Area. Those lakes which meet the criteria for Type 2, 3, 4 and 5 waters as set forth in WAC 222-16-030, as now or hereafter amended. This includes lakes and ponds less than 20 acres in surface area and their submerged aquatic beds, and lakes and ponds planted with game fish by a governmental or tribal authority.

(3) Wildlife Conservation Areas.

(a) Class I Wildlife Conservation Areas.

(i) Habitats recognized by federal or state agencies for federal and/or state listed endangered, threatened and sensitive species documented in maps or databases available to Kitsap County and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term.

(ii) Areas targeted for preservation by the federal, state and/or local government which provide fish and wildlife habitat benefits, such as important waterfowl areas identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

(iii) Areas that contain habitats and species of local importance.

(b) Class II Wildlife Conservation Areas.

(i) Habitats for state listed candidate and monitored species documented in maps or databases available to Kitsap County and its citizens, and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term.

(ii) Habitats which include attributes such as comparatively high wildlife density; high wildlife species richness; significant wildlife breeding habitat, seasonal ranges or movement corridors of limited availability and/or high vulnerability. These habitats may include caves, cliffs, islands, meadows, old-growth/mature forest, snag-rich areas, talus slopes, and urban natural open space. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.072 Development standards. 

Those regulated uses identified below within designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall comply with the performance standards outlined in this section. Potential impacts to fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or their buffers shall be appropriately identified and mitigated consistent with Article XII of this chapter.

(1) Buffers and Building Setbacks. Buffers or setbacks shall be maintained along the perimeter of fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, as listed in Table 5. Distances shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark (OHM) or from the top of the bank where the OHM cannot be identified. Buffers shall be retained in their natural condition. It is acceptable, however, to enhance the buffer by planting indigenous vegetation, as approved by the department. Alteration of buffer areas may be allowed for water-dependent and water-related activities subject to the city’s shoreline master program (Chapter 20.164 POMC), and for development authorized by POMC 20.162.034, Exceptions, POMC 20.162.032, Exemptions, POMC 20.162.038, Nonconforming – Existing structures, or POMC 20.162.036, Variances. The buffer width shall be increased to include streamside wetlands which provide overflow storage for stormwaters, feed water back to the stream during low flows or provide shelter and food for fish. In braided channels, the ordinary high water mark or top of bank shall be defined so as to include the entire stream feature. Refuse shall not be placed in buffers.

(Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article V. Geologically Hazardous Areas


20.162.074 Purpose.

This chapter applies to all regulated uses included in the critical areas ordinance within 200 feet of areas designated as geologically hazardous areas, as categorized in POMC 20.162.076. The intent of this chapter is to:

(1) Provide standards to protect human life and property from potential risks;

(2) Control erosion, siltation, and water quality to protect fish and marine shellfish;

(3) Provide controls to minimize erosion caused by human activity;

(4) Use innovative site planning by placing geologically hazardous areas and buffers in open space and transferring density to more suitable areas on the site. (Ord. 010-18 § 29; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.076 Geologically hazardous area categories.

The following categories shall be used in classifying geologically hazardous areas:

(1) Geologically Hazardous Areas.

(a) Areas with slopes greater than 30 percent and mapped by the Coastal Zone Atlas or spatial GIS data provided by the Washington Geologic Information Portal1 as unstable (U), unstable old land slides (UOS) or unstable recent slides (URS).

(b) Areas with slopes greater than 30 percent in grade and deemed by a qualified geologist or geotechnical engineer to meet the criteria of U, UOS, or URS.

(2) Areas of Geologic Concern.

(a) Areas designated U, UOS, or URS in the Coastal Zone Atlas or spatial GIS data provided by the Washington Geologic Information, with slopes less than 30 percent; or areas found by a qualified geologist to meet the criteria for U, URS, and UOS with slopes less than 30 percent; or

(b) Slopes identified as intermediate (I) in the Coastal Zone Atlas or spatial GIS data provided by the Washington Geologic Information, or areas found by a qualified geologist to meet the criteria of I; or

(c) Slopes 15 percent or greater, not classified as I, U, UOS, or URS, with soils classified by the Natural Resources Conservation Service as “highly erodible” or “potentially highly erodible”; or

(d) Slopes of 15 percent or greater with springs or groundwater seepage not identified in subsection (2)(a), (b), or (c) of this section; or

(e) Seismic areas subject to liquefaction from earthquakes (seismic hazard areas) such as hydric soils as identified by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and areas that have been filled to make a site more suitable. Seismic areas may include former wetlands, which have been covered with fill; or

(f) Areas with any indications of earth movement such as debris slides, earthflows, slumps and rock falls; or

(g) Areas with artificial oversteepened or unengineered slopes, i.e., cuts or fills; or

(h) Areas oversteepened or otherwise unstable as a result of stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action.

(3) Site-Specific Determination – Geological and Geotechnical Report Provisions. Should the applicant question the information the city must rely on to determine whether a location contains a geologically hazardous area or area of geologic concern, the city may ask the applicant to submit the appropriate geotechnical or geologic report to confirm or modify the existing information known about the area. The requirements for these reports are contained in Articles VIII and X of this chapter.

The intent of this provision is to allow obviously nongeologically hazardous sites to be determined as such. Where there is any ambiguity about the potential for geologic hazards whatsoever, the department will require a geotechnical or geological report, rather than make a nongeologically hazardous determination. (Ord. 010-18 § 30; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.078 Development standards.

This chapter applies to all regulated uses in this chapter or within 200 feet of areas designated as geologically hazardous or areas of concern. Permit applications include submittals for clearing, grading and building on property containing geologically hazardous areas. Submittal documents prepared by a licensed engineer may also be required by the department, pursuant to the city’s stormwater regulations.

(1) Geologically Hazardous Areas and Areas of Geologic Concern.

(a) Approval. Where applicable the department will approve, approve with conditions or deny the development proposal based on the department’s evaluation of specific site conditions. The department will also consider any proposed mitigation measures included in a geotechnical report, if one is submitted.

(b) Public Works Requirements. The applicant shall submit a land disturbing activity permit application to the department. The application and supporting documents shall be completed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington. The submittal documents shall be determined on a site-specific basis. The documents may include any combination of, but not be limited to, construction plans, details and specifications for clearing, grading, erosion and sedimentation control, and stormwater drainage and detailed hydrological, geotechnical, soils, and drainage reports and analyses.

(c) Minimum Buffer Requirement. The buffer for all geologically hazardous areas and areas of geologic concern shall include native vegetation from the toe of the slope to 25 feet beyond the top of the slope unless otherwise allowed through a geological report or a site-specific determination.

(d) Building/Impervious Surface Setback Requirements.

(i) Geologically Hazardous Areas. The minimum building and impervious surface setback from the top of slope shall be equal to the height of the slope (1:1 horizontal to vertical) plus the greater of one-third of the vertical slope height or 25 feet.

(ii) Areas of Geologic Concern. A minimum 40-foot building and impervious surface setback shall be maintained from the top of slope. As required in subsection (1)(c) of this section, the 25 feet adjacent to the top of the slope shall be retained as a native vegetation buffer, with an additional minimum 15-foot building and impervious surface setback. The department may decrease the setback when such a setback would result in a greater than 1:1 slope setback or as may be allowed through a geological report or a site-specific determination.

(iii) Toe of Slope Building Setback. A geotechnical report may be required for any new construction within 200 feet of a geologically hazardous area. The department will make a determination based on slope height and stability indicators. Where slope hazard indicators are not identified, the requirements of the International Building Code Section 1805 or Section R403 will apply.

(e) Buffer and Building Setback Modifications – Report Recommendations. The minimum native vegetation buffer and/or building setback requirement may be decreased if a geotechnical report demonstrates that a lesser distance, through design and engineering solutions, will adequately protect both the proposed development and the erosion hazard and/or landslide hazard area (see Articles VIII and X of this chapter for geological and geotechnical report requirements). Should the geotechnical report indicate that a greater buffer and/or building setback is required than specified in this section, the greater buffer and/or building setback shall be required. The department may determine through a site visit, a special report or mapping, that an increased buffer and/or building setback is required from the critical area.

(f) Time Limitations. For major new development, and where required for minor new development, clearing, and grading, shall be limited to the period between May 1st to October 1st, unless the applicant provides an erosion and sedimentation control plan prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington that specifically and realistically identifies methods of erosion control for wet weather conditions.

(g) Field Marking Requirements. For major new development, the proposed clearing for the project and all critical area buffers shall be marked in the field for inspection and approval by the department prior to beginning work. Field marking requirements for minor new development will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the department. The field marking of all buffers shall remain in place until construction is completed and final approval is granted by the department. Permanent marking may be required as determined necessary to protect critical areas or their buffers.

(h) Cut and Fill Slopes. The faces of all cut and fill slopes shall be protected to prevent erosion as required by the engineered erosion and sedimentation control plan.

(i) Development Impact Standards. All discharge of runoff from the development site shall be of like quality, flow rate, and velocity as that which flowed from the site prior to development. In addition, all stormwater flows shall be accepted onto, and shall be discharged from, the development site at the natural or otherwise legally existing locations. The proposed development shall not decrease the slope stability of any area within 200 feet of the property boundary.

(j) Development Risk Standard. In cases where a special report indicates a significant risk to public health, safety and welfare, the department shall deny or require revision of the site development proposal.

(k) Additional Clearing Standards.

(i) Only the clearing necessary to install temporary erosion control measures will be allowed prior to the clearing for roads and utilities construction.

(ii) Clearing for roads and utilities shall be the minimum necessary and shall remain within marked construction limits.

(iii) Clearing for overhead power lines shall be the minimum necessary for construction and will provide the required minimum clearances of the serving utility.

(l) Existing Logging Roads. Where existing logging roads occur in geologically hazardous areas or areas of geologic concern, a geological or geotechnical report may be required prior to use as a temporary haul road or permanent access road under a conversion or COHP forest practices application.

(m) Clustering Requirements. The department may require clustering to increase protection to geologically hazardous areas or areas of geologic concern.

(n) Vegetation Enhancement. The department may require enhancement of buffer vegetation to increase protection to geologically hazardous areas or areas of geologic concern.

(o) Seismic Hazard Area Development Standards.

(i) Proposed new development within a seismic hazard area shall be in accordance with the Uniform Building Code (UBC) Earthquake Design Standards for Seismic Risk Zone 3 of Washington State.

(ii) Applicants for public and commercial building proposals within seismic hazard areas shall submit a geotechnical report addressing any fill or grading that has occurred on the subject parcel. Any fill placed for such development shall have documented construction monitoring as required by the International Building Code.

(iii) All major new development in seismic hazard areas shall require a geotechnical report. Minor new development may also require a geotechnical report, as determined by the department.

(iv) The development proposal may be approved, approved with conditions or denied based on the department’s evaluation of the proposed mitigation measures to reduce seismic risk.

(2) Prohibitions.

(a) Critical facilities, as defined in Article II of this chapter, are prohibited in geologically hazardous areas.

(b) In geologically hazardous areas with slopes greater than 80 percent, no development will be allowed either on or within the defined buffer area, unless approved by the department after review of a geotechnical report. The defined buffer zone for geologically hazardous areas is defined in subsection (1)(d) of this section.

(c) On-site sewage disposal should be avoided in geologically hazardous areas and their buffers. In cases where such areas cannot be avoided, review by a geologist or a geotechnical engineer licensed in the state of Washington will be required in coordination with the Bremerton-Kitsap County health district. (Ord. 010-18 § 31; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article VI. Frequently Flooded Areas


20.162.080 Purpose and requirements. 

The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety and welfare from harm caused by flooding. It is also the intent to prevent damage and/or loss to both public and private property. Pursuant to this purpose, the city uses Chapter 20.170 POMC, Flood Damage Prevention, adopted by reference, which designates special flood hazard areas and establishes permit requirements for these areas.

In addition, the Kitsap County GIS database for critical drainage areas of the stormwater management regulations will be included for areas of review under frequently flooded areas. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article VII. Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas


20.162.082 Purpose.

The intent of this article is to provide water quality protection associated with aquifer recharge areas through the regulation of land use activities that pose a potential contaminant threat or could increase the vulnerability of the aquifer. It is the policy of the city to accomplish the following: 

(1) Identify, preserve and protect aquifer recharge areas and prevent degradation of the quality of potable groundwater;

(2) Recognize the relationship between surface and groundwater resources; and

(3) Balance competing needs for water while preserving essential natural functions/processes. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.084 Critical aquifer recharge area categories.

A critical aquifer recharge area is a geographical area which provides the recharge to an aquifer(s) which is a current or potential potable water source and, due to its geological properties, is highly susceptible to the introduction of pollutants, or because of special circumstances, has been designated as a critical aquifer recharge area in accordance with WAC 365-190-080 by the city. Critical aquifer recharge areas under this chapter may be established based on general criteria or specifically designated due to special circumstances.

(1) Category I – Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas. The following general criterion is established to designate critical aquifer recharge areas: wellhead protection zones around Group A water system supply wells:

(a) Areas inside the one-year time of travel zone for Group A water system wells, calculated in accordance with the Washington State Well Head Protection Program.

(b) Five-year time of travel zones in wellhead protection areas are included as critical aquifer recharge areas under the following condition: The five-year time of travel zone is included when the well draws its water from an aquifer that is at or above sea level and is overlain by permeable soils listed in subsection (2)(a) of this section without an underlying protective impermeable layer (see below).

(2) Category II – Aquifer Recharge Areas of Concern. Areas which provide recharge to aquifers that provide current or potential potable water supplies and are vulnerable to contamination, and meet any one of the following general criteria:

(a) Highly Permeable Soils – Locations Where Surface Soil Layers Are Highly Permeable. Soils that have relatively high permeability and high infiltration potential may provide for groundwater recharge, but also may enhance transfer of contaminants from the surface to groundwater. For these reasons the locations where surface soils are highly permeable are considered aquifer recharge areas of concern.

The general location and characteristics of soils in Kitsap County and the city is given in the Soil Survey of Kitsap County by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (SCS). The soil survey information is available on the Kitsap County geographic information system (GIS). The following soil types are considered to have relatively high permeability and are aquifer recharge areas of concern.

The following soils have relatively high infiltration:

	SCS Soil Name	SCS Soil Map Units

	Grove 	11, 12, 13

	Indianola	18, 19, 20, 21

	Neilton	34, 35, 36

	Norma	37, 38

	Poulsbo/Ragnar	41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47

(b) Areas Above Shallow Principal Aquifers. Surface areas above shallow principal aquifer(s) which are not separated from the underlying aquifers by an impermeable layer that provides adequate protections to preclude the proposed land use from contaminating the shallow aquifer(s) below are considered aquifer recharge areas of concern. This generally includes principal aquifers in subsurface hydrogeologic units Og1, Og1a, Og2 and portions of Og3 that are within 300 feet of the ground surface. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.162.086 Development standards.

Standards for development shall be in accordance with the provisions below and the requirements of the underlying zoning:

(1) A hydrogeological report will be required on sites that have been identified as having characteristics with high infiltration rates, or having a high aquifer recharge or infiltration potential for land uses identified in Table 20.162.086, unless determined unnecessary upon coordination with agencies with jurisdiction (Bremerton-Kitsap County health district and/or affected water purveyors). This evaluation shall apply to impacts on both groundwater and surface water, as it relates to recharge areas (see requirements in Article VIII of this chapter, Special Reports).

(2) Affected water purveyors will be notified and requested to comment during the preliminary phases of the city’s review process on the proposed land use and potential impacts. The purveyor may recommend appropriate mitigation to reduce potential impacts. The department will consider these recommendations to develop appropriate permit conditions.

(3) This section shall not affect any right to use or appropriate water as allowed under state or federal law. In addition, these requirements do not apply to those activities which have potential contaminant sources below threshold amounts as set forth in applicable state RCWs or local regulations.

In addition to the general standards above, the following will apply:

(a) Category I – Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas. Land uses identified in Table 20.162.086 are prohibited in critical aquifer recharge areas. Requests for waivers shall include a hydrogeological report, which includes a detailed risk-benefit analysis that considers credible, worst-case scenarios. The waiver will be evaluated and treated as a special use review, similar to the review process in Article VIII of this chapter, Special Reports, by the review department, the health district, and the affected water purveyors. 

(b) Category II – Aquifer Recharge Areas of Concern. Applicants proposing operations that pose a potential threat to groundwater as defined in Table 20.162.086 in aquifer recharge areas of concern may be required to submit a hydrogeological report. The scope of the report shall be based on site-specific conditions. The need for additional information will be determined by the department, the health district and the affected water purveyor. Based on the results of the report, controls, mitigation, and/or other requirements will be established as a prerequisite for the development proposal being approved.

(c) The department will also notify the health district and affected water purveyors through the environmental review process when those development activities listed in Table 20.162.086 are proposed outside the areas designated critical aquifer recharge areas and aquifer recharge areas of concern.

(2) Administrative Wetland Boundary and Ranking Evaluation.

(a) An informal determination of the regulated wetland boundary and an evaluation of any unranked regulated wetland may be completed by the department for any minor new development project listed in Article II of this chapter, unless the applicant wishes to employ a qualified wetland biologist at the applicant’s expense, or if such a report is required by the department. Fees may be collected for this determination and evaluation.

(b) Methodology for delineation of the regulated wetland boundary shall be the plant community assessment procedure, which is described in the Washington State Wetlands Identification and Delineation Manual, March 1997, or as amended hereafter. 

(c) The wetland boundary shall be field staked and this line shall be depicted on the building site plan application.

(d) The regulated wetland boundary and regulated wetland buffer shall be identified on all grading, building site, utility or other development plans submitted on the project.

(3) Wetland Mitigation Report.

(a) Whenever the department has determined that losses of regulated wetlands are necessary and unavoidable, or a review of a regulated wetland or its buffer is proposed, or an exception to uses is allowed or a variance to standards is granted, a mitigation plan shall be prepared which is considered in the following order of preference:

(i) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of actions. This may be accomplished by selecting a reasonable alternative that does not involve wetlands or wetland impacts, applying reasonable mitigation measures, such as drainage and erosion control, alternative site planning, and/or using best available technology. In reviewing development proposals required to submit a wetlands mitigation plan, the department shall first determine if the impact can be avoided (e.g., impacts cannot be avoided if denial of the development proposal or parts thereof or mitigation measures would result in an extraordinary hardship and denial of reasonable use of property).

(ii) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts. This may be accomplished by selecting a reasonable alternative that avoids most wetland impacts, applying reasonable mitigation measures, such as drainage and erosion control, alternative site planning, and/or using best available technology. In reviewing development proposals required to submit a wetland mitigation plan, the department shall determine if the impact can be first avoided and secondly minimized. Impacts cannot be avoided or minimized if denial of the development proposal or parts thereof or mitigation measures would result in an extraordinary hardship and denial of reasonable use of property.

(iii) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment. This may be done by reestablishing wetland and wetland buffer characteristics on a site which have been lost by alterations or activities. Rectifying shall be accomplished in accordance with a mitigation plan, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements in subsection (3)(d) of this section and has been approved by the department. In reviewing development proposals required to submit a wetland mitigation plan, the department shall determine if the impact should be rectified. Impacts can be rectified if mitigation measures would not result in an extraordinary hardship and denial of reasonable use of the property.

(iv) Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments. This may be done by intentionally creating wetlands and wetland buffers at another location where none currently exist, improving existing wetlands and wetland buffers at another location, or otherwise providing a substitute wetland resource at another location as compensation for any unavoidable adverse wetland impacts. Compensating shall be accomplished in accordance with a mitigation plan, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements in subsection (3)(d) of this section and has been approved by the department. In reviewing development proposals required to submit a wetland mitigation plan, the department shall determine if the impact should be compensated. Impacts can be compensated if compensation and mitigation measures would not result in an extraordinary hardship and denial of reasonable use of property. Compensation of wetland impacts may be waived by the department for development authorized by POMC 20.162.034, Exceptions. 

(b) The overall goal of any mitigation plan shall be no net loss of regulated wetland functions and acreage.

(c) Those persons proposing wetland compensatory projects shall show that the compensation project is associated with an activity or development otherwise permitted and that the restored, created, or enhanced wetland will be as persistent as the wetland it replaces by accomplishing the following:

(i) Demonstrate sufficient scientific expertise, supervisory capability, and financial resources to carry out the project; and

(ii) Demonstrate the capability for monitoring the site and for making corrections during this period, if the project fails to meet projected goals; and

(iii) Protect and manage or provide for the protection and management of the compensation area to avoid further development or degradation.

(d) Wetland mitigation plans shall be implemented by the project applicant, and include the following components:

(i) Baseline Information. A written assessment and accompanying maps of the impacted wetland shall be produced by the applicant or applicant’s consultant and shall include, at a minimum: existing wetland acreage; vegetative, faunal and hydrologic characteristics; soil and substrate conditions; and topographic elevations.

(ii) If the compensation site is off site from the impacted wetland site, baseline information about it, in addition to the above information about the impacted wetland, shall be provided by the applicant and shall include all those items listed in subsection (3)(d)(i) of this section and as well as: the relationship of the compensation site within the watershed and to existing water bodies; existing and proposed existing compensation site conditions; buffers; and ownership.

(iii) Environmental Goals and Objectives. The report shall identify goals and objectives and include:

(A) The purposes of the compensation measures including a description of site selection criteria, identification of compensation goals, identification of target evaluation species and resource functions, dates for beginning and completion of compensation measures, and a complete description of the structure and functional relationships sought in the new wetland. The goals and objectives shall be related to the functions of the original wetland or, if out-of-kind, the type of wetland to be emulated; and

(B) A review of the available literature and/or experience to date in restoring or creating the type of wetland proposed shall be provided. An analysis of the likelihood of success of the compensation project at duplicating the original wetland shall be provided based on the experiences of comparable projects, if any. An analysis of the likelihood of persistence of the created or restored wetland shall be provided based on such factors as: surface and groundwater supply and flow patterns; dynamics of the wetland ecosystem; sediment or pollutant influx and/or erosion; periodic flooding and drought, etc.; presence of invasive flora or fauna; potential human or animal disturbance; and previous comparable projects, if any.

(iv) Performance Standards. Specific criteria shall be provided for evaluating whether or not the goals and objectives of the mitigation plan are being achieved at various stages in the project and for beginning remedial action or contingency measures. Such criteria may include water quality standards, survival rates of planted vegetation, species abundance and diversity targets, habitat diversity indices, or other ecological, geological or hydrological criteria.

(v) Detailed Construction Plans. Written specifications and descriptions of compensation techniques shall be provided including the proposed construction sequence, grading and excavation details, erosion, sediment and stormwater recharge control features needed for wetland construction and long-term survival, a planting plan specifying plant species, quantities, locations, size, spacing, and density; the source of plant materials, propagules, or seeds; water and nutrient requirements for planting; where appropriate, measures to protect plants from predation; specification of substrate stockpiling techniques and planting instructions; descriptions of water control structures and water-level maintenance practices needed to achieve the necessary hydrocycle/hydroperiod characteristics; etc. These written specifications shall be accompanied by detailed site diagrams, scaled cross-sectional drawings, topographic maps showing slope percentage and final grade elevations, and any other drawings appropriate to show construction techniques or anticipated final outcome. The plan shall provide for elevations which are appropriate for the desired habitat type(s) and which provide sufficient tidal prism and circulation data.

(vi) Monitoring Program. A program outlining the approach for monitoring construction of the compensation project and for assessing a completed project shall be provided. Monitoring must include sufficient information to adequately assess the progress of a project. Monitoring may include, but is not limited to:

(A) Establishing vegetation plots to track changes in plant species composition and density over time;

(B) Using photo stations to evaluate vegetation community response;

(C) Sampling surface and subsurface waters to determine pollutant loading and changes from the natural variability of background conditions (pH, nutrients, heavy metals);

(D) Measuring base flow rates and stormwater runoff to model and evaluate water quantity predictions by a licensed engineer in the state of Washington, where required;

(E) Measuring sedimentation rates, if applicable; and

(F) Sampling fish and wildlife populations to determine habitat utilization, species abundance and diversity. A protocol shall be included outlining how the monitoring data will be evaluated by agencies that are tracking the progress of the compensation project. A monitoring report shall be submitted annually and, at a minimum, documenting milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project. The compensation project shall be monitored for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period of less than three years.

(vii) Contingency Plan. Identification of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken when monitoring or evaluating indicates project performance standards are not being met.

(viii) Permit Conditions. Any compensation project prepared pursuant to this section and approved by the department shall become part of the application for the permit.

(e) Performance Bonds and Demonstration of Competence.

A compensation project manager shall be named, and the qualifications of each team member involved in preparing the mitigation plan and implementing and supervising the project shall be provided, including educational background and areas of expertise, training and experience with comparable projects. In addition, bonds ensuring fulfillment of the compensation project, monitoring program, and any contingency measure shall be posted in the amount of 150 percent of the expected cost of compensation and shall be effective for a period of no less than three years and no greater than 10 years after completion of the mitigation plan.

(f) Waiver. The department may waive portions of this report if, in his or her opinion, there is adequate information available on the site to determine its impacts and appropriate measures.

(g) List of Qualified Consultants. The department shall establish a list of qualified consultants to prepare mitigation plans. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article IX. Habitat Management Plan


20.162.098 Habitat management plan content.

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Priority Habitat and Species Management Recommendations, dated May 1991, or bald eagle protection rules outlined in WAC 232-12-292, as now or hereafter amended, may serve as guidance for this report. The recommendation in the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Priority Habitat and Species Management Recommendations, dated May 1991, shall not serve as mandatory standards or policy of this chapter, until such time as the Department of Fish and Wildlife holds public hearings on the recommendations and the State Wildlife Commission endorses the recommendations following the public hearings.

(2) The habitat management plan shall contain a map prepared at an easily readable scale, showing: 

(a) The location of the proposed development site; 

(b) The relationship of the site to surrounding topographic features, water features, and cultural features; 

(c) Proposed building locations and arrangements; 

(d) A legend which includes a complete legal description, acreage of the parcel, scale, north arrows, and date of map revision.

(3) The habitat management plan shall also contain a report, which describes:

(a) The nature and intensity of the proposed development; 

(b) An analysis of the effect of the proposed development, activity or land use change upon the wildlife species and habitat identified for protection; and

(c) A plan which identifies how the applicant proposes to mitigate any adverse impacts to wildlife habitats created by the proposed development. (See mitigation plan requirements, Article VIII of this chapter.)

(4) Possible mitigation measures to be included in the report, or required by the department, could include, but are not limited to:

(a) Establishment of buffer zones;

(b) Preservation of critically important plants and trees;

(c) Limitation of access to habitat areas;

(d) Seasonal restriction of construction activities; and

(e) Establishing phased development requirements and/or a timetable for periodic review of the plan.

(5) This plan shall be prepared by a person who has been educated in this field and has professional experience as a fish or wildlife biologist. Where this plan is required for the protection of an eagle habitat, the eagle habitat management plan shall normally be prepared by the Department of Wildlife, as required under the bald eagle management rules. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article X. Geotechnical Report and Geological Report


20.162.100 Geotechnical report contents.

(1) A geotechnical report shall include a description of the site geology, conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of geologic conditions on the proposed development, opinions and recommendations of the adequacy of the site to be developed, the effects of groundwater interception and infiltration, seepage, potential slip planes, and changes in soil bearing strength, and the impacts of the proposed development and appropriate mitigating measures. A geotechnical report may contain information obtained with subsurface investigative measures such as test pit digging, soil boring, water well installation or Dutch Cone Penetrometer investigations. Reports containing engineering design recommendations; i.e., recommendations for foundations (loading, sizing, depth, or settlement estimates), pile or pier design, retaining structures, or recommendations for construction on slopes steeper than 30 percent, must be prepared by or in conjunction with a licensed geotechnical engineer as defined in subsection (2) of this section.

A geological report shall include the above, with the exception of engineering design recommendations, and need not make use of subsurface investigative measures. As the report will not include engineering recommendations, a geological report may be prepared by a geologist or engineering geologist as defined in subsection (2) of this section.

(2) Geotechnical reports shall be prepared by a geotechnical engineer (a civil engineer licensed by the state of Washington who is knowledgeable of regional geologic conditions and who has at least four years’ professional experience in landslide and/or seismic hazard evaluation). Geological reports may be prepared by a geologist, engineering geologist or geotechnical engineer knowledgeable in regional geologic conditions and having at least four years’ professional experience in site evaluation and development studies, and landslide and/or seismic hazard evaluation. 

(3) Report recommendations for siting structures in high risk areas shall be based on existing site conditions rather than measures that have not yet been successfully approved, designed or constructed (e.g., slope recontouring, slope retaining walls, vegetation improvements, bulkheads, etc.). Shoreline bulkheads and retaining walls may only be utilized as an engineering solution where it can be demonstrated that an existing residential structure cannot be safely maintained without such measures, and that the resulting retaining wall is the minimum necessary to provide a stable building area for the structure. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article XI. Hydrogeological Reports


20.162.102 Hydrogeological report content.

A hydrogeological report shall be required for certain proposed operations based on a consultation with the appropriate local and state agencies. The report shall address the impact the proposed land use will have on both the quality and quantity of the water transmitted to the aquifer. The report shall also address the types of pesticides and herbicides and fertilizers that can safely be used for the care of landscaping proposed by the applicant. 

(1) The report shall be submitted to the reviewing authority and address, at a minimum, the following criteria: 

(a) Surficial soil type and geologic setting;

(b) Location and identification of wells within 1,000 feet of the site;

(c) Location and identification of surface water bodies and springs within 1,000 feet of the site with recharge potential;

(d) Description of underlying aquifers and aquitards, including water level, gradients and flow direction;

(e) Available surface water and groundwater quality data;

(f) Effects of the proposed development on water quality;

(j) Other information as required by the Bremerton-Kitsap County health district.

(2) The hydrogeologic report shall be prepared by a professional geologist/hydrologist or by a soil scientist with a strong background in geology as demonstrated by course work from an accredited college or university and/or has a minimum of five years’ experience.

(3) Applications for development or operations with underground storage of petroleum products will be processed using the appropriate procedure as specified in existing state regulations and city ordinances.

(4) Analysis for a specific parcel(s), using the criteria outlined below, will be employed to determine if the soils present require a recharge area designation. Data collection will include, at a minimum: six soil logs to a depth of 10 feet (or to a depth four feet below the lowest proposed excavation point whichever is greater) for each acre in the parcel(s) being evaluated. At least one well which is 200 feet or greater in depth with an adequate drilling report must be available within one mile. The associated data shall be analyzed and included in the hydrogeologic report to determine the presence of highly permeable soils with the recharge area designation. 

For development proposals within aquifer recharge areas of concern, the hydrogeological report may be based on quarter-quarter section basis locations where the number of wells within a half-mile radius is 36 or more, and are designated aquifer recharge areas. To facilitate computer analysis, the evaluation may be done on a quarter-quarter section basis using the quarter-quarter section in which a parcel of interest is located and all the surrounding quarter-quarter sections, in place of the half-mile circle. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article XII. Mitigation Requirements


20.162.104 General mitigation requirements. 

Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, if alteration to a critical area or its buffer is unavoidable, all adverse impacts resulting from a development proposal or alteration shall be mitigated using the best available science so as to result in no net loss of critical area functions and values, as provided below. 

(1) In making a determination as to whether such a requirement will be imposed, and if so, the degree to which it would be required, the director shall consider the following:

(a) The long-term and short-term effects of the action and the reversible or irreversible nature of the impairment to or loss of the critical area;

(b) The location, size, and type of and benefit provided by the original and altered critical area;

(c) The effect the proposed work may have upon any remaining critical area or associated aquatic system;

(d) The cost and likely success of the compensation measures in relation to the magnitude of the proposed project or violation;

(e) The observed or predicted trend with regard to the gains or losses of the specific type of wetland or stream; and

(f) The extent to which the applicant has demonstrated a good faith effort to incorporate measures to minimize and avoid impacts within the project.

(2) Mitigation projects shall not result in adverse impacts to adjacent property owners.

(3) Mitigation shall be in kind and on site, when possible, and sufficient to maintain the functions and values of the critical area.

(4) Mitigation shall not be implemented until after permit approval of the director and shall be in accordance with all reports and representations made therein.

(5) Mitigation Sequencing. When an alteration to a critical area or its buffer is proposed, such alteration shall be avoided, minimized, or compensated for in the following order of preference.

(a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

(b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts.

(c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment.

(d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations.

(e) Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments.

(f) Monitoring the required mitigation and taking remedial action where necessary.

(6) Mitigation for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensatory mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project or alteration to achieve functional equivalency or improvement and shall provide similar critical area or buffer functions as those lost, except when:

(a) The lost critical area or buffer provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific functional assessment, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington state watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

(b) Out of kind replacement of wetland, stream or other fish and wildlife habitat type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished critical areas.

(7) Type and Location of Mitigation. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternative approach, compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either in kind and on site, or in kind and within the same stream reach, subbasin, or drift cell (if estuarine wetlands are impacted). Mitigation action shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply:

(a) There are no reasonable on-site or in subdrainage basin opportunities (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high functioning upland habitat), or on-site and in subdrainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the natural capacity of the site to compensate for impacts. Considerations should include: anticipated mitigation ratios for the identified critical area(s), buffer conditions and proposed widths, available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands, or streams when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity);

(b) Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved critical area functions than the impacted critical area; and

(c) Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin unless established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site.

(8) Wetland Mitigation Banks.

(a) Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:

(i) The bank is certified under state rules;

(ii) The director determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and

(iii) The proposed use of credits shall be consistent with terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.

(b) Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.

(c) Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, the service area of the bank may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions.

(9) In-Lieu Fee. To aid in the implementation of off-site mitigation, the city may develop a program which prioritizes wetland areas for use as mitigation and/or allows payment in lieu of providing mitigation on a development site. This program shall be developed and approved through a public process and be consistent with state and federal rules. The program should address:

(a) The identification of sites within the city that are suitable for use as off-site mitigation. Site suitability shall take into account wetland functions, potential for wetland degradation, and potential for urban growth and service expansion, and

(b) The use of fees for mitigation on available sites that have been identified as suitable and prioritized.

(10) Timing of Compensatory Mitigation. It is preferred that compensation projects will be completed prior to activities that will disturb the on-site critical area. If not completed prior to disturbance, compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following the disturbance and prior to the issuance of final certificate of occupancy. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora. The director may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified professional as to the rationale for the delay (i.e., seasonal planting requirements, fisheries window).

(11) Critical Area Enhancement as Mitigation. Impacts to critical area functions may be mitigated by enhancement of existing significantly degraded critical areas, but should be used in conjunction with restoration and/or creation where possible. Applicants proposing to enhance critical areas or their buffers must include in a report how the enhancement will increase the functions of the degraded critical area or buffer and how this increase will adequately mitigate for the loss of critical area and function at the impact site. An enhancement proposal must also show whether any existing critical area functions will be reduced by the enhancement action. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Attachment A – Washington State Wetlands Rating System Categories

(A) Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington Department of Ecology wetland rating system, as set forth in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication #14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology), which contains the definitions and methods for determining whether the criteria below are met. 

1. Category I. Category I wetlands are: (1) relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than 1 acre; (2) wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR; (3) bogs; (4) mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than 1 acre; (5) wetlands in coastal lagoons; (6) interdunal wetlands that score 8 or 9 habitat points and are larger than 1 acre; and (7) wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more). These wetlands: (1) represent unique or rare wetland types; (2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; (3) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or (4) provide a high level of functions. 

2. Category II. Category II wetlands are: (1) estuarine wetlands smaller than 1 acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than 1 acre; (2) interdunal wetlands larger than 1 acre or those found in a mosaic of wetlands; or (3) wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points). 

3. Category III. Category III wetlands are: (1) wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19 points); (2) can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project; and (3) interdunal wetlands between 0.1 and 1 acre. Wetlands scoring between 16 and 19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. 

4. Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scoring fewer than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that we should be able to replace, or in some cases to improve. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree. 

(B) Illegal modifications. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications made by the applicant or with the applicant’s knowledge.

Article I. General Provisions


20.170.010 Statutory authorization.

The Legislature of the state of Washington has in RCW Title 35 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city does ordain as follows in this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.020 Findings of fact.

(1) The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:

(1) To protect human life and health;

(2) To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

(7) To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

(8) To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.045 FIRM zones AE and A1-30 with base flood elevations but no floodways.

In areas with base flood elevations (but a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.050 Lands to which this chapter applies.

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.060 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for the Kitsap County, Washington and Incorporated Areas,” dated November 4, 2010, and any revisions thereto, with accompanying flood insurance maps, is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in POMC 20.170.170 shall be the basis for new regulation until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under POMC 20.170.170. The flood insurance study is on file at the city clerk’s office: 216 Prospect Street, Port Orchard, WA 98366. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.070 Penalties for noncompliance.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00 or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.080 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or repair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.090 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

(1) Considered as minimum requirements;

(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.100 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article II. Definitions


20.170.110 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined in this section, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meanings they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

(1) “Appeal” means a request for a review of the city building official’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

(2) “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

(3) “Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

(4) “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equated or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

(5) “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.

(6) “Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation structure.

(7) “Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on the FIRM as Zone V1-30, VE or V.

(8) “Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

(9) “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

(10) “Elevated building” means, for insurance purposes, a nonbasement building that has its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, piers, pilings, or columns.

(11) “Elevation certificate” means the official form (FEMA Form 81-31) used to track development, provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with community floodplain management ordinances, and determine the proper insurance premium rate with Section B completed by community officials.

(12) “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the adopted floodplain management regulations.

(13) “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing lots on which manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either the final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

(14) “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

(a) The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

(b) The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

(15) “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

(16) “Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

(17) “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

(18) “Increased cost of compliance” means a flood insurance claim payment up to $30,000 directly to a property owner for the cost to comply with floodplain management regulations after a direct physical loss caused by a flood. Eligibility for an ICC claim can be through a single instance of “substantial damage” or as a result of “cumulative substantial damage.”

(19) “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed areas (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found in POMC 20.170.300(2).

(20) “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term “manufactured home” does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.

(21) “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

(22) “New construction” means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(23) “Start of construction” includes substantial improvements, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

(24) “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

(25) “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

(26) “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

(a) Before the improvement or repair is started; or

(b) If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

(5) Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (4) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(6) The city building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.220 Conditions for variances.

(1) Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the items in POMC 20.170.210(4)(a) through (4)(k) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(2) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

(3) Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:

(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in POMC 20.170.210(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(6) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. 

(7) Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (1) of this section, and otherwise complies with POMC 20.170.240 and 20.170.250.

(8) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

Article V. Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction


20.170.230 General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards, the standards in POMC 20.170.240 through 20.170.280 are required. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.240 Anchoring.

(Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.320 Critical facility.

Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the base floodplain. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the base floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the base floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation at the site or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to insure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base floodplain shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.330 Manufactured homes.

All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH and AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot or more above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of POMC 20.170.240(2).

20.170.340 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in POMC 20.170.060 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the provisions in this section apply.

(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(2) Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

(a) Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor areas; and

(b) Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

(i) Before the repair, reconstruction or improvement is started; or

(ii) If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or to structures identified as historic places, may be excluded in the 50 percent.

Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places shall not be included in the 50 percent.

(3) If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.350 Wetlands management.

To the maximum extent possible avoid the short and long term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands, especially those activities which limit or disrupt the ability of the wetlands to alleviate flooding impacts. The following process should be implemented:

(1) Review proposals for development within base floodplains for their possible impacts on wetlands located within the floodplain.

(2) Ensure that development activities in or around wetlands do not negatively affect public safety, health and welfare by disrupting the wetlands’ ability to reduce flood and storm drainage.

(3) Request technical assistance from the Department of Ecology in identifying wetland areas. Existing wetland map information from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) can be used in conjunction with the community’s FIRM to prepare an overlay zone indicating critical wetland areas deserving special attention. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.170.360 Coastal high hazard areas.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in POMC 20.170.060 are coastal high hazard areas, designated as zones V1-30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:

(1) All new construction and substantial improvements in zones V1-30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) on the community’s FIRM shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:

(a) The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level; and

(b) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections (1)(a) and (b) of this section.

(2) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The city shall maintain a record of all such information.

(3) All new construction within zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.

(4) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements within zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purposes of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the design proposed meets the following conditions:

(a) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

(b) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.

(5) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings within zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM.

(6) Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes within zones V1-30, VE, and V on the community’s FIRM which would increase potential flood damage.

(7) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community’s FIRM on sites:

(a) Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;

(b) In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

(c) In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

(d) In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood;

shall meet the standards of subsections (1) through (6) of this section and manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones V1-30, V, and VE on the FIRM shall meet the requirements of POMC 20.170.330.

(8) Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community’s FIRM either:

(a) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

(b) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

(c) Meet the requirements of POMC 20.170.120, Development permit required, and subsections (1) through (6) of this section. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

The following types of permits are not subject to the capacity reservation certificate (CRC) process because they do not create additional long-term impacts on transportation facilities, additional sewer capacity in the city’s waste water treatment plant, or a need for more potable water from the city’s water system:

(a) Administrative interpretations;

(b) Sign permit;

(c) Street vacations;

(d) Demolition permit;

(e) Street use permit;

(f) Interior alterations of a structure with no change in use;

(g) Excavation/clearing permit;

(h) Hydrant use permit;

(i) Right-of-way permit;

(j) Single-family remodeling with no change of use;

(k) Plumbing permit;

(l) Electrical permit;

(m) Mechanical permit;

(n) Excavation permit;

(o) Sewer connection permit;

(p) Driveway or street access permit;

(q) Grading permit;

(r) Tenant improvement permit;

(s) Fire code permit;

(t) Design review.

Notwithstanding the above, if any of the above permit applications will generate any new p.m. peak hour trips, require additional sewer capacity, or increase water consumption, such application shall not be exempt from the requirements of this chapter.

(2) Transportation. This chapter shall apply to all applications for development or redevelopment if the proposal or use will generate any new p.m. peak-hour trips. Every application for development shall be accompanied by a capacity reservation certificate application. Developments or redevelopments that will generate one or more new projected vehicle trips that will pass through an intersection or roadway section identified with a level of service below the acceptable level noted in the transportation element in the city’s comprehensive plan, or that will generate 15 or more new p.m. peak hour trips, shall also be required to submit information for a traffic report pursuant to POMC 20.180.011(2)(b).

(3) Water. This chapter shall apply to all applications for development or redevelopment if the proposal or use requires water from the city’s water system (not West Sound Utilities). In addition, this chapter shall apply to existing developments to the extent that the property owner requires water for a use not disclosed on a previously submitted water service application or a previously submitted application for a capacity reservation certificate.

(4) Sewer. This chapter shall apply to all applications for development or redevelopment if the proposal or use requires sewer from the city’s sewer system (not West Sound Utilities). In addition, this chapter shall apply to existing developments to the extent that the property owner requires sewer for a use not disclosed on a previously approved request for sewer service or a previously approved application for a capacity reservation certificate. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.005 Capacity evaluation required for a change in use.

Any nonexempt development activity shall require a capacity evaluation in accordance with this chapter.

(1) Increased Impact on Road Facilities, and/or the City’s Water/Sewer System. If a change in use will have a greater impact on road facilities and/or the city’s water/sewer system than the previous use, as determined by the director, based on review of information submitted by the applicant and such supplemental information as available, a CRC shall be required for the net increase only. Provided that: the applicant shall provide reasonably sufficient evidence that the previous use has been actively maintained on the site during the five-year period prior to the date of application for the capacity evaluation.

(2) Decreased Impact on Road Facilities and/or the City’s Water/Sewer System. If a change in use will have an equal or lesser impact on road facilities and/or the city’s water/sewer system than the previous use as determined by the director, based on review of information submitted by the applicant and supplemental information as available, a CRC will not be required.

(3) No Capacity Credit. If no use existed on the site for the five-year period prior to the date of application, no capacity credit shall be issued pursuant to this section.

(4) Demolition or Termination of Use. In the case of a demolition or termination of an existing use or structure, the capacity evaluation for future redevelopment shall be based upon the net increase of the impact on road facilities or the city’s water or sewer system for the new or proposed land use, as compared to the land use existing prior to demolition. Provided, that such credit is utilized through a CRC within five years of the date of the issuance of the demolition permit. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.006 Capacity evaluations required for certain rezones and comprehensive plan amendments.

A capacity evaluation shall be required as part of any application for a comprehensive plan amendment or zoning map amendment (rezone) submitted by a property owner which, if approved, would increase the intensity or density of permitted development. As part of that capacity evaluation, the director shall determine whether capacity is available to serve both the extent and density of development which would result from the zoning/comprehensive plan amendment. The capacity evaluation shall be submitted as part of the staff report and shall be considered by the city in determining the appropriateness of the comprehensive plan or zoning amendment. The city’s approval of any comprehensive plan or zoning map amendment shall not reserve any capacity in water, sewer or transportation facilities unless the property owner has applied for and is issued a CRC and a development agreement which includes a deadline for the property owner’s submission of development permit application for the proposed development. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.007 All capacity determinations and capacity reservation certificate applications exempt from project permit processing.

As allowed by RCW 36.70B.140, the processing of applications pursuant to the authority in this chapter shall be exempt from project permit processing procedures as described in Subtitle II of this title, unless otherwise specifically noted in this chapter. The city’s processing of capacity reservation certificates and resolving capacity disputes involves a different review procedure due to the necessity to perform continual monitoring of facility and service needs, to ensure continual funding of facility improvements, and to develop annual updates to the transportation and utilities elements of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.008 Level of service standards.

(1) Generally. Level of service (LOS) is the established minimum capacity of public facilities or services that must be provided per unit of demand or other appropriate measure of need, as mandated by Chapter 36.70A RCW. LOS standards shall be used to determine if public facilities or services are adequate to support a development’s impact. The concept of concurrency is based on the maintenance of specified levels of service through capacity monitoring, allocation and reservation procedures. Concurrency describes the situation in which water, sewer and/or road facilities are available when the impacts of development occur. For road facilities, this time period is statutorily established as within six years from the time of development. (See RCW 36.70A.070(6)(b) and WAC 365-195-210(3), (7), (19).1)

(a) Roads. The city has designated levels of service for road facilities in the transportation element of the city’s comprehensive plan:

(i) To conform to RCW 47.80.030 for transportation facilities subject to regional transportation plans;

(ii) To reflect realistic expectations consistent with the achievement of growth aims;

(iii) To prohibit development if concurrency for road facilities is not achieved (RCW 36.70A.070), and if sufficient public and/or private funding cannot be found, land use assumptions in the city’s comprehensive plan will be reassessed to ensure that level of service standards will be met, or level of service standards will be adjusted.

(b) Water. The city has a permitted withdrawal volume of water issued by the Department of Ecology. “Level of service” as it relates to water is defined in the water element of the city’s comprehensive plan as the ability to provide potable water to the consumer for use and fire protection. The ability to provide water supply is limited by the water permit from the Department of Ecology.

(c) Sewer. The city is required to obtain a permit from the Department of Ecology in order to discharge effluent into the waters of the state. This permit is limited by levels and volume. “Level of service” as it relates to sewer is defined in the city’s sewer comprehensive plan as the ability to provide sanitary sewer services to the consumer for use, treatment at the city’s wastewater treatment plant and discharge into Puget Sound. The city’s ability to provide such service is limited by the physical capacity of the city’s wastewater treatment plant as well as the NPDES permit issued by the Department of Ecology. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.009 Effect of LOS standards.

(1) Roads. The director shall use the LOS standards set forth in the transportation element of the city’s comprehensive plan to make concurrency evaluations as part of the review of any application for a transportation concurrency reservation certificate (CRC) issued pursuant to this chapter.

(2) Water. The director shall use the existing water rights as permitted by the Department of Ecology and as identified in the utilities element of the city’s comprehensive plan to make concurrency evaluations as part of the review of any application for a water CRC issued pursuant to this chapter.

(3) Sewer. The director shall use the limits and levels established in the city’s NPDES permit from the Department of Ecology, and evaluate the remaining capacity in the city’s wastewater treatment plan as part of the review of any application for a sewer CRC issued pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.010 Capacity evaluations required prior to issuance of CRC.

(1) A capacity evaluation for transportation, water or sewer shall be required for any of the activities that are not exempt under POMC 20.180.004(1).

(2) The director shall utilize the method described in POMC 20.180.013 and this chapter to conduct a capacity evaluation prior to issuance of a CRC. In addition to these requirements, the director may also utilize state law or the Washington Administrative Code, or such other rules regarding concurrency. In cases where LOS standards do not apply, the director shall have the authority to utilize other factors in preparing capacity evaluations to include, but not be limited to, independent LOS analysis.

(3) A capacity reservation certificate (CRC) will not be issued except after a capacity evaluation performed pursuant to this chapter, indicating that capacity is available in all applicable road facilities and/or within the city’s water or sewer system. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.011 Application for capacity reservation certificate.

(1) An application for a CRC and the application for the underlying development permit, or other activity, shall be accompanied by the requisite fee, as determined by city council resolution. An applicant for the CRC shall also submit the following information to the director, on a form provided by the director, together with the underlying development application:

(a) Date of submittal;

(b) Developer’s name, address, telephone number and email;

(c) Legal description of property as required by the underlying development permit application, together with an exhibit showing a map of the property;

(d) Proposed use(s) by land use category, square feet and number of units;

(e) Phasing information by proposed uses, square feet and number of units, if applicable;

(f) Existing use of property;

(g) Acreage of property;

(h) Proposed site design information, if applicable;

(i) The applicant’s proposed mitigation (if any) for the impact on the city’s transportation facilities;

(j) Written consent of the property owner, if different from the developer;

(k) Proposed request for capacity by legal description, if applicable;

(l) For water capacity reservation certificates only: water hydraulic report prepared by a licensed professional engineer, which shall include the purpose for which water is required;

(m) For sewer capacity only: sewer hydraulic report prepared by a licensed professional engineer, which shall include the purpose for which the sewer capacity is required;

(n) Stormwater drainage report prepared by a licensed professional engineer.

(2) Additional information for transportation capacity evaluations only:

(a) A preliminary site plan, which is a plan showing the approximate layout of proposed structures and other development, type and number of dwelling units, type and number of nonresidential building areas with gross square footage, the land use codes per the most recent edition of Trip Generation from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) and an analysis of the points of access to existing and proposed roadways;

(b) The applicant is not required to submit a traffic impact analysis from an independent traffic engineer. Instead, those applicants with a transportation CRC application that are required to have the city provide a traffic report in accordance with POMC 20.180.004(2) shall instead pay to the city a deposit equal to the estimated fee for the city’s preparation of a traffic report. The amount of the fee shall be determined by city resolution and paid at the time the transportation CRC application is submitted. The fee shall vary based on the number of new p.m. peak-hour trips produced by the development. The applicant shall be subject to repayment of fees for any subsequent revisions to the original traffic report. Fees for revisions may be calculated in proportion to the original fee depending on the effort involved to revise the traffic report. Even if the traffic report is based on an estimate of the impact, the applicant will still be bound by the estimate of the impact, and any upward deviation from the estimated traffic impact shall require at least one of the following: (i) a finding that the additional concurrency sought by the developer through a revised application is available to be reserved by the project; (ii) mitigation of the additional impact under SEPA; (iii) revocation of the CRC. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.012 Submission and acceptance of a CRC application.

(1) Notice of Application. Issuance of a notice of application for the underlying permit application shall be handled by the community development director or designee, following the process in Chapter 20.25 POMC. The notice of application shall state that an application for a concurrency determination has been received by the city.

(2) Determination of Completeness. The community development director shall immediately forward all CRC applications received with development applications to the public works/engineering staff. Within 28 days after receiving an application for a CRC, the public works/engineering staff shall mail or personally deliver to the applicant a determination which states either:

(a) That the concurrency application is complete; or

(b) That the concurrency application is incomplete and what is necessary to make the application complete.

(3) Additional Information. An application for a CRC is complete for purposes of initial processing when it meets the submission requirements in POMC 20.180.011. The determination of completeness shall be made when the application is sufficiently complete for review, even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequently. The director’s determination of completeness shall not preclude the director’s ability to request additional information or studies.

(4) Incomplete Applications.

(a) Whenever the city issues a determination that the CRC application is not complete, the CRC application shall be handled in the same manner as an incomplete project permit application under Chapter 20.24 POMC.

(b) Date of Acceptance of Application. An application for a CRC shall not be officially accepted or processed until it is complete and the underlying development application has been determined complete. When an application is determined complete, the director shall accept it and note the date of acceptance. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.013 Method of capacity evaluation.

(1) Generally. In order to determine concurrency for the purposes of issuance of a transportation, water or sewer CRC, the director shall make the determination described in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section. The director may deem the development concurrent with transportation facilities or the city’s water or sewer system, with the condition that the necessary facilities or services shall be available through a financial commitment in an enforceable development agreement (see Chapter 20.26 POMC). In no event shall the director determine concurrency for a greater amount of capacity than is needed for the development proposed in the underlying application.

(2) Transportation.

(a) Upon submission and acceptance of a complete transportation CRC application, the director shall conduct a traffic impact analysis and issue a traffic report for those applications meeting the requirements of POMC 20.180.004(2).

(b) In performing the concurrency evaluation for transportation facilities, and to prepare the transportation CRC, the director shall determine, based on the conclusions of the traffic report, whether a proposed development can be accommodated within the existing or planned capacity of transportation facilities. This shall involve the following:

(i) A determination of anticipated total capacity at the time the proposed impacts of development occur or within six years of such time;

(ii) Calculation of how much of that capacity will be used by existing developments and other planned developments at the time the impacts of the proposed development occur;

(iii) Calculation of the available capacity for the proposed development;

(iv) Calculation of the impact on the capacity of the proposed development, minus the effects of any mitigation identified by the applicant to be provided by the applicant at the applicant’s cost;

(v) Comparison of available capacity with proposed development impacts.

(c) The director shall determine if the capacity of the city’s transportation facilities, less the capacity which is reserved, can be provided while meeting the level of service performance standards set forth in the city’s comprehensive plan, and if so, shall provide the applicant with a transportation CRC. The director’s determination will be based on the application materials provided by the applicant, which must include the applicant’s proposed mitigation for the impact on the city’s transportation facilities.

(3) Water.

(a) In performing the capacity evaluation for water, and to prepare the water CRC, the director shall determine whether a proposed development can be accommodated within the existing or planned capacity of the city’s water system. This shall involve the following:

(i) A determination of anticipated total capacity at the time the proposed impacts of development occur;

(ii) Calculation of how much of that capacity will be used by existing developments and other planned developments at the time the impacts of the proposed development occur;

(iii) Calculation of the available capacity for the proposed development;

(iv) Calculation of the impact on the capacity of the proposed development, minus the effects of any mitigation provided by the applicant; and

(v) Comparison of available capacity with proposed development impacts.

(b) The director shall determine if the capacity of the city’s water facility, less the capacity which is reserved, can be provided while remaining within the city’s permitted water rights for withdrawal volume, and if so, shall provide the applicant with a water CRC.

(4) Sewer.

(a) In performing the capacity evaluation for sewer, and to prepare the sewer CRC determination, the director shall determine whether a proposed development can be accommodated within the existing or planned capacity of the city’s sewer system. This shall involve the following:

(i) A determination of the anticipated total capacity at the time the proposed impacts of development occur;

(ii) Calculation of how much of that capacity will be used by existing developments and other planned developments at the time the impacts of the proposed development occur;

(iii) Calculation of the available capacity for the proposed development;

(iv) Calculation of the impact on the available capacity for the proposed development, minus the effects of any mitigation provided by the applicant; and

(v) Comparison of available capacity with proposed development impacts.

(b) The director shall determine if the capacity in the city’s wastewater treatment plant, less the capacity which is reserved, can be provided while remaining within the city’s NPDES permit for discharge volumes and levels, and if so, shall provide the applicant with a sewer CRC.

(5) Lack of Concurrency.

(a) Transportation. If the director determines that the proposed development will cause the LOS of a city-owned transportation facility to decline below the standards adopted in the transportation element of the city’s comprehensive plan, and improvements or strategies to accommodate the impacts of development are not planned to be made concurrent with development, a transportation CRC and the underlying development permit, if such an application has been made, shall be denied. Upon denial, the applicant may perform one of the following:

(i) Appeal the denial in accordance with POMC 20.180.021; or

(ii) Offer alternative data and/or perform an independent traffic impact analysis at the applicant’s sole expense in support of alternative conclusions. Any study shall be in accordance with POMC 20.180.025; or

(iii) Modify the development proposal to lessen the traffic impacts and/or identify voluntary transportation improvements as mitigation to be provided by the applicant at the applicant’s cost and reapply for capacity reservation certificate. Reapplication shall require repayment of the traffic report preparation fee in accordance with POMC 20.180.011(2)(b); or

(iv) Withdraw the CRC application.

(b) Water and Sewer. If the director determines that there is no capacity available in the city’s water system to provide water and/or capacity in the city’s wastewater treatment plant for a proposed project, and improvements or strategies to accommodate the impacts of development are not planned to be made concurrent with development, the director shall deny the water and/or sewer CRC. The city has the discretion to deny the underlying development application for lack of potable water, depending on the applicant’s ability to provide water for the proposed project from another source. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.014 Purpose of capacity reservation certificate.

(1) A transportation CRC is a determination by the director that: (a) the proposed development identified in the CRC application does not cause the level of service on a city-owned transportation facility to decline below the standards adopted in the transportation element of the city’s comprehensive plan; or (b) that a financial commitment (embodied in a development agreement) is in place to complete the necessary improvements or strategies within six years. Upon issuance of a transportation CRC, the director will reserve transportation facility capacity for this application until the expiration of the underlying development permit or as otherwise provided in POMC 20.180.020. Although the CRC may identify the number of projected trips associated with the proposed development, nothing in this chapter (including the trip transfer procedures) shall imply that the applicant “owns” or has any ownership interest in the projected trips.

(2) A water CRC is a determination by the director that: (a) the proposed development identified in the CRC application does not exceed the city’s existing water rights or the limits of any state-issued permit, or (b) that a financial commitment (embodied in a development agreement) is in place to complete the necessary improvements or strategies prior to the submittal of complete building permit applications. Upon issuance of a water CRC, the director will reserve water capacity for the application until the expiration of the underlying development permit or as otherwise provided in POMC 20.180.020.

(3) A sewer CRC is a determination by the director that: (a) the proposed development identified in the CRC application does not exceed the city’s existing NPDES permit limits or the existing capacity in the city’s wastewater treatment plant, or (b) that a financial commitment (embodied in a development agreement) is in place to complete the necessary improvements or strategies prior to the submittal of complete building permit applications. Upon issuance of a sewer CRC, the director will reserve sewer capacity for the application until the expiration of the underlying development permit.

(4) The factors affecting available water or sewer capacity or availability may, in some instances, lie outside the city’s control. The city’s adoption of this chapter relating to the manner in which the city will make its best attempt to allocate water or sewer capacity or availability does not create a duty in the city to provide water or sewer service to the public or any individual, regardless of whether a water or sewer CRC has issued. Every water availability certificate and water and sewer CRC shall state on its face that it is not a guarantee that water and/or sewer will be available to serve the proposed project. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.015 Procedure for capacity reservation certificates.

After receipt of a complete application for a CRC, the director shall process the application in accordance with this chapter and issue the CRC or a denial letter. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.016 Use of reserved capacity.

When a CRC and a development permit issue for a project, the CRC shall continue to reserve the capacity unless the development permit lapses or expires without issuance of a certificate of occupancy. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.017 Transfer of reserved capacity.

Reserved capacity shall not be sold or transferred to property not included in the legal description provided by the applicant in the CRC application. The applicant may, as part of a development permit application, designate the amount of capacity to be allocated to portions of the property, such as lots, blocks, parcels or tracts included in the application. Capacity may be reassigned or allocated within the boundaries of the original reservation certificate by application to the director. At no time may capacity or any certificate be sold or transferred to another party or entity to real property not described in the original application. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.018 Denial letter.

If the director determines that there is a lack of capacity under the above provisions, the director shall issue a denial letter, which shall advise the applicant that capacity is not available. If the applicant is not the property owner, the denial letter shall also be sent to the property owner. At a minimum, the denial letter shall identify the application and include the following information:

(1) For Roads.

(a) An estimate of the level of the deficiency on the transportation facilities; and

(b) The city may also include options available to the applicant such as the applicant’s agreement to construct the necessary facilities at the applicant’s cost.

(2) For Water.

(a) The options available to the applicant, such as private water supplies or other water purveyor services; and

(b) The city may also include options available to the applicant such as the applicant’s agreement to construct the necessary facilities at the applicant’s cost.

(3) For Sewer. The city may include the options available to the applicant such as a temporary septic system (if allowed by law) which the applicant would agree in a development agreement to install and remove at his/her own cost when sewer capacity became available.

(4) For All. A statement that the denial letter may be appealed pursuant to the procedures in POMC 20.180.021. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.019 Notice of capacity reservation certificate or capacity evaluation.

Notice of the capacity reservation certificate or capacity evaluation shall be given to the public together with, and in the same manner as, that provided for the SEPA threshold determination for the underlying development permit application or legislative action, unless the project is exempt from SEPA, in which case notice shall be given in the same manner as a final decision on the underlying development permit without any accompanying threshold determination. In the case of an approved CRC, any mitigation identified by the applicant to be provided by the applicant at the applicant’s cost shall be included in the SEPA threshold determination or underlying permit decision (if categorically exempt from SEPA). (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.020 Expiration of CRC and extensions of time.

(1) Expiration. If a certificate of occupancy has not been requested prior to the expiration of the underlying permit or termination of the associated development agreement, the director shall convert the reserved capacity to available capacity for the use of other developments. The act of requesting a certificate of occupancy before expiration of the CRC shall only convert the reserved capacity to used capacity if the building inspector finds that the project actually conforms with applicable codes.

(2) Extensions for Road Facilities. The city shall assume that the developer requests an extension of transportation capacity reservation when the developer is requesting a renewal of the underlying development permit. No unused capacity may be carried forward beyond the expiration of the transportation CRC or any subsequent extension.

(3) Extensions for Water or Sewer. The city shall not extend any water or sewer CRC. If the developer submits an application for an extension of the underlying permit, the applicant shall submit a new application for a concurrency determination for water or sewer under this chapter.

(4) If a CRC has been granted for a rezone or comprehensive plan amendment under POMC 20.180.006, the CRC shall expire when the development agreement for the comprehensive plan or rezone terminates. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.021 Appeals.

(1) A denial letter may be appealed if the appeal is submitted to the public works director within 10 business days after issuance of the denial letter. The appeal must conform to the requirements in Chapter 20.24 POMC. The denial letter must also be filed prior to issuance of the city’s decision on the underlying development application. If an appeal is filed, processing of the underlying development application shall be stayed until the city’s final decision on the appeal of the denial letter.

(2) Upon receipt of an appeal of the denial letter, the director shall handle the appeal as follows:

(a) A meeting shall be scheduled with the applicant to review the denial letter and the application materials, together with the appeal statement.

(b) Within 14 days after the meeting, the director shall issue a written decision, which will list all of the materials he or she considered in making the decision. The director’s decision shall either affirm, modify or reverse the denial letter. If the denial letter is reversed, the director shall identify the mitigation that the applicant proposes to provide at the applicant’s cost, which will be imposed on the application approval in order to achieve concurrency.

(c) The mitigation identified in the director’s decision shall be incorporated into the city’s SEPA threshold decision on the application.

(d) The director’s decision shall state that it may be appealed with any appeal of the underlying application or activity. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.022 Concurrency administration and procedure.

(1) “Capacity” refers to the ability or availability of water in the city’s water system. “Capacity” refers to the ability to treat effluent in the city’s wastewater treatment plant to the levels and volume limits in the city’s NPDES permit. “Capacity” also refers to the ability or availability of road facilities to accommodate users, expressed in an approximate unit of measure, such as LOS for road facilities. “Available capacity” represents a specific amount of capacity that may be reserved by or committed to future users of the city’s water or sewer system or road facilities.

(2) There are two capacity accounts to be utilized by the director in the implementation of this chapter for water, sewer and transportation. These accounts are:

(a) The available capacity account; and

(b) The reserved capacity account.

Capacity is withdrawn from the available capacity account and deposited into a reserved capacity account when a CRC is issued. Once the proposed development is constructed and an occupancy certificate is issued, the capacity is considered “used.” Each capacity account of available or reserved capacity will experience withdrawals on a regular basis. Only the director may transfer capacity between accounts. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.023 Annual reporting and monitoring.

(1) The director is responsible for completion of annual transportation, water and sewer capacity availability reports. These reports shall evaluate reserved capacity and permitted development activity for the previous 12-month period, and determine existing conditions with regard to available capacity for road, sewer and water facilities. The evaluations shall report on capacity used for the previous period and capacity available for the six-year capital facilities and utilities element of the city’s comprehensive plan, six-year transportation plan for road facilities, based on LOS standards, and the sewer and water comprehensive plans. Forecasts shall be based on the most recently updated schedule of capital improvements, growth projections, water rights, annual water withdrawal volumes, limits of the NPDES permit, public road facility inventories, and revenue projections, and shall, at a minimum, include:

(a) A summary of development activity;

(b) The status of each capacity account;

(c) The six-year transportation plan;

(d) Actual capacity of selected street segments and intersections and current LOS;

(e) Recommendations on amendments to CIP and TIP and annual budget, to LOS standards, or other amendments to the transportation element of or to the comprehensive plan;

(f) Existing water rights and annual withdrawal volumes; and

(g) Limits in the city’s NPDES permit and finding of available capacity in the city’s wastewater treatment plant.

(2) The findings of the annual capacity availability report shall be considered by the council in preparing the annual update to the capital improvement element, any proposed amendments to the CIP and six-year TIP, and shall be used in the review of development permits and capacity evaluations during the next period.

(3) Based upon the analysis included in the annual capacity availability reports, the director shall recommend to the city council each year any necessary amendments to the CIP, TIP, utilities and/or water element of the comprehensive plan, and comprehensive plan. The director shall also report on the status of all capacity accounts when public hearings for comprehensive plan amendments are heard. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.180.024 Road LOS monitoring and modeling.

(1) The city shall monitor level of service standards through an annual update of the six-year transportation plan which will add data reflecting development permits issued and trip allocations reserved.

(1) This chapter is enacted pursuant to the city’s police powers, the Growth Management Act (Chapter 36.70A RCW), the impact fee statutes (RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100), the State Subdivision Act (Chapter 58.17 RCW) and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA, Chapter 43.21C RCW).

(2) The purpose of this chapter is to:

(a) Develop a program consistent with the city’s parks, open space and recreation plan, six-year road plan and the city’s comprehensive plan (parks and transportation elements) and capital improvement plan, for joint public and private financing of park and transportation facility improvements necessitated in whole or in part by development in the city;

(b) Develop a program for financing of school facilities consistent with the capital improvement plan of the school district, as such public facilities are necessitated in whole or in part by development in the city;

(c) Ensure adequate levels of service in public facilities within the city and school district;

(d) Create a mechanism to charge and collect fees to ensure that all new development bears its proportionate share of the capital costs of off-site park, school and transportation facilities reasonably related to new development, in order to maintain adopted levels of park service, maintain adopted levels of service in the city’s transportation facilities, and to ensure the availability of adequate school facilities at the time of new development;

(e) Ensure that the city pays its fair share of the capital costs of parks and transportation facilities necessitated by public use of the parks and roadway system, and ensure that the school district pays its fair share of the capital costs of school facilities; and

(f) Ensure fair collection and administration of such impact fees. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.020 Applicability and definitions.

(1) Chapter 20.184 POMC includes the definitions for this chapter and Chapter 20.180 POMC on concurrency management. The requirements of this chapter apply to all development in the city, as “development” or “development activity” is defined in Chapter 20.12 POMC.

(2) Mitigation of impacts on parks and transportation facilities located in jurisdictions outside the city will be required when:

(a) The other affected jurisdiction has reviewed the development’s impact under its adopted impact fee/mitigation regulations and has recommended to the city that there be a requirement to mitigate that impact; and

(b) There is an interlocal agreement between the city and the affected jurisdiction specifically addressing impact identification and mitigation. (Ord. 010-18 § 33; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.030 Geographic scope.

(g) Shall not be collected for improvements to park and transportation facilities in other municipalities unless the affected municipality requests that such impact fees be collected on behalf of the affected municipality, and an interlocal agreement has been executed between the city and the affected municipality for the collection of such fees;

(h) Shall be collected only once for each development, unless changes or modifications to the development are proposed which result in greater direct impacts on park, school and/or transportation facilities than were considered when the development was first permitted;

(i) May be imposed for system improvement costs previously incurred by the city and school district, to the extent that new growth and development will be served by previously constructed improvements; and provided, that such fee shall not be imposed to make up for any system improvement deficiencies; and

(j) Shall only be imposed for park and school facilities on residential development. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.050 Approval of development.

Prior to approving or permitting a development or development permit, the approving authority shall consult with the director and the superintendent of the school district concerning mitigation of a development’s impacts and impact fees. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.060 Fee schedules and establishment of service area.

(1) Impact fee schedules setting forth the amount of the impact fees to be paid by developers are listed in the appendices attached to the ordinance adopting this chapter, and incorporated herein by this reference. The road or transportation impact fee schedule is in Appendix A, park impact fees are in Appendix B and school impact fees are in Appendix C.

(2) For the purpose of road and park impact fees, the entire city shall be considered one service area.

(3) For the purpose of school impact fees, the entire boundary of the school district shall be considered one service area. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.070 Calculation of impact fees.

(1) Director Calculates the Fees. The director shall calculate the impact fees set forth in Appendices A and B. The superintendent of the school district shall calculate the school impact fees set forth in Appendix C. The city council shall have the final decision on the calculation of the impact fees to be imposed under this chapter as set forth in Appendices A and B.

(2) Factors Used in Impact Fee Calculations. The calculation of impact fees shall include the factors identified in RCW 82.02.040 through 82.02.070 and shall:

(a) Determine the standard fee for similar types of development, which shall be reasonably related to each development’s proportionate share of the cost of projects described in the project list for each type of impact fee.

(b) Reduce the proportionate share by applying the benefit factors described in POMC 20.182.080.

(3) Proportionate Share. In calculating proportionate share, the following factors shall be considered:

(a) Identification of all park, school and transportation facilities that will be impacted by users from development;

(b) Identification of the point at which the capacity of a park, school or transportation facility has been fully utilized;

(c) Updating of the data as often as practicable, but at least annually;

(d) Estimation of the cost of construction of the projects in the project list (see POMC 20.182.120) for roads at the time they are placed on the list; the cost of maintaining the city’s level of park service as shown on Appendix B; and the costs relating to the construction of school facilities, and to then update the cost estimates at least annually, considering the:

(i) Availability of other means of funding park, school and transportation facilities;

(ii) Cost of existing park, school and transportation facility improvements;

(iii) Methods by which park, school and transportation facility improvements were financed; and

(iv) An adjustment to the cost of the park, school and transportation facilities for past or future payments or reasonably anticipated to be made by new development to pay for particular system improvements in the form of user fees, debt service payments, taxes or other payments earmarked for or proratable to the particular system improvement. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.080 Credits.

(1) Credit Allowed. The director, or, in the case of school impact fees, the superintendent, shall reduce the calculated proportionate share for a particular development by giving credit for the benefit factors described in this section.

(2) Procedure for Obtaining Credit, Time to Request Credit. Requests for credits against impact fees will not be considered unless the developer makes the request in writing, concurrent with the submission of the application for the underlying development permit triggering the impact fee.

(3) Benefit Factors. The director and/or superintendent will consider the following benefit factors when determining whether an impact fee credit is appropriate:

(a) Developer’s dedication of land and/or construction of system improvements. The value of any dedication of land for, improvement to, or new construction of any system improvements provided by the developer, to facilities required by the city that are identified in the capital facilities plan and that are required by the city as a condition of approving the development activity, as long as the following conditions are satisfied. For school impact fees, the superintendent shall consider the value of any dedication of land provided by the developer identified in the school district’s capital facilities plan as long as the following conditions are satisfied to the extent applicable:

(i) The system improvements are located on land owned by the city; and

(ii) A designated public owner is responsible for permanent, continuing maintenance and operation of the system improvements; and

(iii) The director determines that the system improvements correspond to the type(s) of park and transportation system improvements that are reasonably related to the development as determined pursuant to this chapter;

(iv) The director determines, after consultation with the school district, as applicable, and after an analysis of supply and demand data, the parks, open space and recreation plan, the six-year road plan and the adopted park and transportation plan, that the proposed park and transportation system improvements better meet the city’s need for park and transportation system improvements than would payment of funds to mitigate the park and transportation impacts of the development;

(v) In the determination of credit toward the impact fee, the director or the superintendent shall also consider the extent to which the proposed dedication or conveyance meets the following criteria:

(A) The land should result in an integral element of the city park/road system;

(B) The land is suitable for future park, school and/or transportation facilities;

(C) The land is of appropriate size and of an acceptable configuration;

(D) The land has public access via a public street or an easement of an equivalent width and accessibility;

(E) The land is located in or near areas designated by the city or county on land use plans for park, trail or recreational purposes, or, in the case of schools, is appropriately located for school facilities;

(F) The land provides linkage between county and/or other publicly owned recreation and transportation properties;

(G) The land has been surveyed or adequately marked with survey monuments, or is otherwise readily distinguishable from adjacent privately owned property;

(H) The land has no known physical problems associated with it, such as the presence of hazardous waste, drainage erosion or flooding problems which the director or superintendent determines would cause inordinate demands on public resources for maintenance and operation;

(I) The land has no known safety hazards;

(J) The developer is able to provide documentation, as nearly as practicable, of the land’s compliance with the criteria of this subsection, and of clear title;

(K) The developer is able to provide and fund a long-term method, acceptable to the director or superintendent, for the management and maintenance of the land, if applicable.

(4) Requirement for System Improvement Plan by City. When the director has agreed to a developer’s proposal to satisfy some or all of the impact fee through the purchase, installation and/or improvement of park and/or transportation facilities, the developer shall prepare and submit a system improvement plan to the director for approval prior to recordation of a plat or short plat for subdivisions, and prior to issuance of a building permit for all other developments.

(5) Statutory Benefit Factors. The director or superintendent may consider any applicable benefit factors, as described in RCW 82.02.060 (as it now exists or may hereafter be amended), that are demonstrated by the applicant not to be included in the calculation of the impact fee.

(6) Amount of Credit. The credit against the impact fee shall be equal to the fair market value of the purchased/dedicated property or equal to the cost of the completed system improvements. In those situations in which a developer has not yet installed or constructed system improvements and requests a credit for the system improvement(s), the city engineer shall estimate the cost of the system improvements, which shall be the credit allowed to the developer in the decision on the amount of the impact fee. If a credit is granted for a system improvement that has not been constructed, the developer shall pay the full impact fee without the credit, at the time established in POMC 20.182.110. After construction and/or installation of the system improvement, the developer may request the credit granted by the city engineer under this subsection, and the city shall refund the difference of the impact fee to reflect the credit; provided, that if the city and the property owner have entered into a development agreement on or before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, and the agreement requires the construction of such improvements, the city may allow a credit to be subtracted from the impact fee paid at the time established in POMC 20.182.110.

(7) PRDs, PUDs and Mobile Home Parks. A developer of a planned residential development, a planned unit development, or a mobile home park may receive credit only for park, school and transportation facilities provided in addition to those normally required under SEPA for such developments, pursuant to the city’s SEPA ordinance (Chapter 20.160 POMC).

(8) Credit to Apply Proportionately to Units. The amount of credit determined pursuant to this section shall be credited proportionately among all the units in the development, and the impact fee for each unit for which a permit or approval is applied shall be reduced accordingly.

(9) Limits on Credit Requests. Applicants may not request that an impact fee credit be provided for a proposed development based on taxes, user fees, assessments, improvements, payments or other benefit factors applicable to property that is not included within the proposed development. Credit to be paid back by the city or the school district to a developer under this section shall not exceed the total amount of the impact fees paid by the developer.

(10) Local Improvement Districts. Applicants shall receive credit against the impact fee equal to the amount of an LID assessment paid for transportation-related system improvements identified by the director as increasing transportation system capacity.

(11) Appeals of Credits. The director or superintendent shall issue a written decision on the developer’s request for a credit of the impact fee calculation, which shall explain why the credit was granted or denied. The developer may request reconsideration and appeal the impact fee amount and credit pursuant to POMC 20.182.160. If the procedures in POMC 20.182.160 are not timely followed to request an appeal of the credit, the director or superintendent’s decision on the impact fee credit shall be final. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.090 Variation from impact fee schedule.

With respect to the transportation or park impact fee, if a developer submits information demonstrating a significant difference between the age, social activity or interest characteristics of the population of a proposed subdivision or development and the data used to calculate the impact fee schedule, the director may allow a special calculation of the impact fee requirements for the subdivision or development to be prepared by the developer’s consultant, at the developer’s cost; provided, that: the director shall have prior approval of the qualifications and methodology of the developer’s consultant in making such calculation, and any time period mandated by statute or ordinance for the approving authority’s final decision on the development shall not include the time spent in preparing the special calculation. Whether the director accepts the data provided by the special calculation shall be at the discretion of the director.

With respect to a school impact fee, if a developer submits evidence demonstrating that a development has obtained approval of an age-restricted development in accordance with applicable federal regulations or that a development has recorded a covenant against the development prohibiting occupancy of the development by a population who are not eligible to attend schools within the school district, the superintendent may allow a special calculation of the impact fee requirement for the development at the discretion of the superintendent of the school district. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.100 Payment of fees.

(1) All applicants for development shall pay an impact fee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter which shall be calculated by the city or school district at the time that the building permit is ready for issuance. Applicants/developers may choose to pay impact fees or a portion thereof prior to the city’s issuance of a building permit, but if the early payment is less than the fee calculated at the time the building permit is ready for issuance, the applicant/developer shall pay the difference. If the early payment is more than the fee calculated at the time the building permit is ready for issuance, the city or school district shall refund the difference.

(2) The impact fee shall be recalculated if the development is modified or conditioned in such a way as to alter park, school or transportation impacts for the development.

(3) A developer may obtain a preliminary determination of the impact fee before submitting an application for the development permit by providing the director or superintendent with the information needed for processing together with the applicable fee. Such determinations are provided to the developer as estimates only, and they are not binding on the city, given the limited information needed to calculate the preliminary impact fee amount and the fact that the city or school district annually updates the project list and impact fee schedule. In addition, impact fees are not subject to the vested rights doctrine, and the fee actually paid by the developer will be the impact fee in effect at the time of building permit issuance, regardless of any preliminary determinations. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.110 Time of payment of impact fees.

(1) Payment of any required impact fees shall be made as a condition of the issuance of a building permit or a stormwater permit, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section. School impact fees shall be paid to the school district, and the developer shall present the receipt or proof of payment from the school district to the city for issuance of the building permit.

(2) Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain the necessary permits/approvals until an appeal of the fee amount is finally resolved.

(3) When a subdivision or development is conditioned upon the dedication of land, or the purchase, installation or improvement of park and/or transportation facilities, a final plat or short plat shall not be recorded, and a building permit within such plat or development shall not be issued until:

(a) The director has determined in writing that the land to be dedicated is shown on the face of the final plat or short plat, or a deed conveying the land to the city, the school district or special purpose district, as appropriate, has been recorded with the county auditor; and

(b) The director has determined in writing, after consultation with the designated public owner responsible for permanent, continuing maintenance and operation of the facilities that the developer has satisfactorily undertaken or guaranteed to undertake in a manner acceptable to the director or superintendent, any required purchase, installation or improvement of school, park or transportation facilities.

(4) Deferral of Payment of Impact Fees. Payment of impact fees for single-family attached or single-family detached residential dwelling units may be deferred only until issuance of certificate of occupancy or equivalent certification, pursuant to RCW 82.02.050(3), subject to the following provisions:

(a) Each applicant, in accordance with his or her contractor registration number or other unique identification number, is entitled to annually receive deferrals under this section for the first 20 single-family residential construction building permits per city. Any single-family residential building construction permits beyond 20 for the same applicant are subject to payment of impact fees at the time of building permit issuance as required by subsection (1) of this section.

(b) A request for deferral must be submitted prior to issuance of a building permit.

(c) Application for deferral must be made on a form provided by and acceptable to the city and must include the following information and fees:

(i) Name, address, telephone number and email address of the applicant.

(ii) The specific address, legal description and tax identification number of the single-family dwelling for which deferral is being requested.

(iii) The building permit application number associated with the requested deferral.

(iv) The registration number or other unique identification number for the contractor that will be building the structure.

(v) A statement by the contractor describing how many deferrals have been granted during the current year for said contractor, describing how many have been requested during the current year, and attesting that the number provided and/or requested is less than 20 for the current calendar year.

(vi) Applicable fees for processing the application and for future monitoring of the deferred payment of impact fees are required in addition to fees required by this chapter. Deferral application fees shall include:

(A) Minimum of four hours base administration fee, at the hourly staff rate required by the development fee schedule adopted in the city’s fee resolution, and payable at the time of application submittal.

(B) Minimum of four hours administration fee at the current hourly staff rate to cover additional time spent processing of final payment of impact fees, including but not limited to preparation of lien release documents, payable before the lien release document shall be released to the applicant.

(d) No more than one single-family dwelling may be included on a single application for impact fee deferral.

(e) Impact fees shall be calculated on the fees in place at the time that the applicant applies for a deferral.

(f) Impact fees deferred under this section are due no later than the following events, whichever occur first:

(i) Issuance of certificate of occupancy or equivalent certification for the single-family dwelling; or

(ii) Eighteen months from the date of the building permit issuance.

(g) An applicant seeking a deferral under this subsection must grant and record a deferred impact fee lien against the property in favor of the city of Port Orchard. The deferred impact fee lien must include the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property, and must also be:

(i) In a form approved by the city attorney which ensures that it is binding on all successors on the title to the property after recordation;

(ii) Signed by all owners of the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed, and recorded with the Kitsap County auditor’s office; and

(iii) Junior and subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the person who applied for the deferral of impact fees.

(h) The city may withhold a certificate of occupancy or equivalent certification until the impact fees are paid in full. Upon receipt of final payment of all deferred impact fees for a property, and upon payment of all applicable administration fees in the city’s fee resolution, the city must execute a release of deferred impact fee lien for the property. The property owner at the time of the release, at his or her expense, is responsible for recording the lien release.

(i) Foreclosure Proceedings. If impact fees are not paid in accordance with a deferral authorized by this section, the city may institute proceedings to enforce the lien in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

(j) Obligation to Pay. The extinguishment of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation to pay the impact fees as a condition of issuance of certificate of occupancy or equivalent certification.

(k) Deferral Process Not Subject to Review Proceedings. Per RCW 36.70B.140(2), the processing of an impact fee deferral application is not subject to the project permit review requirements of Chapter 36.70B RCW. (Ord. 010-18 § 34; Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.120 Project list.

(1) The director shall annually review the city’s parks, open space and recreation plan, the six-year road plan and the projects listed in Appendices A and B and shall:

(a) Identify each project in the comprehensive plan that is growth-related and the proportion of each such project that is growth-related;

(b) Forecast the total money available from taxes and other public sources for park and transportation improvements for the next six years;

(c) Update the population, building activity and demand and supply data for park and transportation facilities and the impact fee schedule for the next six-year period;

(d) Calculate the amount of impact fees already paid;

(e) Identify those comprehensive plan projects that have been or are being built but whose performance capacity has not been fully utilized.

(2) The director shall use this information to prepare an annual draft amendment to the fee schedule in Appendices A and B, which shall comprise:

(a) The projects in the comprehensive plan that are growth-related and that should be funded with forecast public monies and the impact fees already paid; and

(b) The projects already built or funded pursuant to this chapter whose performance capacity has not been fully utilized.

(3) The city council, at the same time that it adopts the annual budget and appropriates funds for capital improvement projects, shall, by separate ordinance, establish the annual project list by adopting, with or without modification, the director’s draft amendment.

(4) Once a project is integrated into the fee schedule in Appendices A and B, a fee shall be imposed on every development until the project is removed from the project list by one of the following means:

(a) The city council by ordinance removes the project from the project list and Appendix A and/or B, in which case the fees already collected will be refunded if necessary to ensure that impact fees remain reasonably related to the park and transportation impacts of development that have paid an impact fee; provided, that a refund shall not be necessary if the council transfers the fees to the budget of another project that the council determines will mitigate essentially the same park and transportation impacts; or

(b) The capacity created by the project has been fully utilized, in which case the director shall remove the project from the project list.

(5) The school district shall annually review and update its capital facilities portion of the city’s comprehensive plan and submit such updated plan to the city by July 1st of each year. The school district’s updated capital facilities plan shall identify projects that are growth-related, include the amount of school impact fees paid, calculate the impact fees as required by RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.090, and may include a proposed school impact fee schedule adjustment to Appendix C, for adoption by the city council. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.130 Funding of projects.

(1) An impact fee fund is hereby created for parks and transportation fees. Separate accounts shall be established for each fee type. The school district shall be responsible for the creation of its own impact fee fund and shall be solely responsible for the deposit of fees in such fund, and the calculation/use/refund of such fees. The director shall be the manager of the city’s fund. The city shall place park and transportation impact fees in appropriate deposit accounts within the impact fee fund.

(2) The parks and transportation impact fees paid to the city shall be held and disbursed as follows:

(a) The fees collected for each project shall be placed in a deposit account within the impact fee fund, with the exception of school impact fees, which shall be collected by the school district;

(b) When the council appropriates capital improvement project (CIP) funds for a park or transportation project on the project list, the park or transportation fees held in the impact fee fund shall be transferred to the CIP fund. The nonimpact fee monies appropriated for the project shall comprise both the public share of the project cost and an advancement of that portion of the private share that has not yet been collected in park or transportation impact fees;

(c) The first money spent by the director on a project after a council appropriation shall be deemed to be the fees from the impact fee fund;

(d) Fees collected after a project has been fully funded by means of one or more council appropriations shall constitute reimbursement to the city of the funds advanced for the private share of the project. The public monies made available by such reimbursement shall be used to pay the public share of other projects;

(e) All interest earned on impact fees paid shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which the impact fees were imposed.

(3) Projects shall be funded by a balance between impact fees and public funds, and shall not be funded solely by impact fees.

(4) Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered for a permissible use for 10 years after receipt, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years. The director may recommend to the council that the city hold park or transportation fees beyond 10 years in cases where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist. Such reasons shall be identified in written findings by the council. The superintendent of the school district shall prepare written findings evidencing such extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years which findings shall be approved by the board of directors of the school district.

(5) The school district and the director shall prepare an annual report on the impact fee accounts showing the source and amount of all monies collected, earned or received and system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. The school district shall be responsible for compliance with RCW 82.02.070. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.140 Use and disposition of dedicated land.

All land dedicated or conveyed pursuant to this chapter shall be set aside for development of park, school and transportation facilities. The city or the school district to which land is dedicated or conveyed pursuant to this chapter shall make every effort to use, develop and maintain land dedicated or conveyed for park, school and transportation facilities. In the event that use of any such dedicated land is determined by the director or superintendent to be infeasible for development of park, school or transportation facilities, the dedicated land may be sold or traded for another parcel of land. The proceeds from such a sale shall be used to acquire land or develop park, school or transportation facilities. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.150 Refunds.

(1) A developer may request and shall receive a refund from either the city (for parks and transportation impact fees) or the school district (for school impact fees) when the developer does not proceed with the development activity for which impact fees were paid, and the developer shows that no impact has resulted.

(2) If the city or school district fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within 10 years of the date the fees were paid or the date established by the findings adopted under POMC 20.182.130(4) on public facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The city or school district shall notify potential claimants by first class mail, deposited with the U.S. Postal Service at the last known address of claimants. The request for a refund must be submitted to the city or school district in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date notice is given, whichever is later. Any impact fees that are not expended within these time limitations and for which no application for refund has been made within the one-year period shall be retained and expended on the indicated capital facilities. Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include interest earned on the impact fees. The school district shall be responsible for compliance with this section and RCW 82.02.080 for school impact fees.

(3) In the event that impact fees are refunded for any reason, they shall be refunded by the city with respect to park and transportation fees (and the school district with respect to school impact fees) and shall be returned with interest earned to the owners as they appear of record with the county assessor at the time of the refund.

(4) When the city seeks to terminate any or all impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail to the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, or, if applicable, the school district, but must be expended on a project under the adopted plans of the city or school district. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within an account or accounts being terminated. The school district shall be responsible for compliance with this section for school impact fees under RCW 82.02.080. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.160 Appeals.

(1) Decision of the Director or Superintendent, Reconsideration and Appeals. The director or the superintendent shall issue a written decision on the parks, school and/or transportation impact fee amount as described in this chapter. Because RCW 82.02.070(5) allows the appeal of an impact fee determination to be handled separately from the processing of the underlying permit application, this procedure is exempt from the permit processing requirements in Chapter 20.25 POMC (pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140).

(a) Director’s Decision.

(i) Request for Reconsideration. In order to request reconsideration of the director’s decision, the developer shall make a written request to the director for a meeting to review the fee amount, together with a written request for reconsideration. The request for reconsideration shall include the city’s administrative fee, shall state in detail the grounds for the request, and shall be filed with the director within 15 days after issuance of the director’s decision on the impact fees. At this meeting, the director shall consider any studies and data submitted by the developer seeking to adjust the amount of the fee. The director shall issue a written decision on reconsideration within 10 working days of the director’s receipt of the request for reconsideration or the meeting with the developer, whichever is later.

(ii) Appeal. A developer may appeal the amount of the impact fee established in the decision on reconsideration of the director to the hearing examiner. This appeal must be filed with the city planning department within 14 days of issuance of the decision on reconsideration. The hearing on the appeal of the decision on reconsideration shall be consolidated with the processing of the underlying permit application, if at all possible. An appeal of the decision on reconsideration may be filed even though there is no appeal of the underlying permit. The hearing examiner shall conduct an open record hearing on the appeal of the decision on reconsideration, and if it is not consolidated with the underlying permit, the examiner’s decision shall issue within 10 working days of the hearing (unless a longer period is agreed to by the developer).

(b) Superintendent’s Decision.

(i) Request for Reconsideration. In order to request reconsideration of the superintendent’s decision, the developer shall make a written request to the superintendent for a meeting to review the fee amount, together with a written request for reconsideration. The request for reconsideration shall include the administrative fee, state in detail the grounds for the request, and shall be filed with the superintendent within 15 days after issuance of the superintendent’s decision on the impact fees. At this meeting, the superintendent shall consider any studies and data submitted by the developer seeking to adjust the amount of the fee. The superintendent shall issue a written decision on reconsideration within 10 working days of the superintendent’s receipt of the request for reconsideration or the meeting with the developer, whichever is later.

(ii) Appeal. A developer may appeal the amount of the impact fee established in the decision on reconsideration of the superintendent to the hearing examiner chosen by the district. This appeal must be filed with the superintendent within 14 days of issuance of the decision on reconsideration. The hearing on the appeal of the decision on reconsideration shall not be consolidated with the processing of the underlying permit application. An appeal of the decision on reconsideration may be filed even though there is no appeal of the underlying permit. The hearing examiner shall conduct an open record hearing on the appeal of the decision on reconsideration and issue a decision within 10 working days of the hearing (unless a longer period is agreed to by the developer).

(2) Burden of Proof in Appeals. In an appeal of the decision of the director or superintendent on reconsideration, the developer shall bear the burden of proving:

(a) That the director or superintendent committed error in calculating the developer’s proportionate share, as determined by an individual fee calculation, or if relevant, as set forth in the impact fee schedule, or in granting credit for the benefit factors; or

(b) That the director or superintendent based their determination upon incorrect data.

(3) Appeals of Hearing Examiner’s Decision.

(a) Appeals from the decision of the school district’s hearing examiner on the superintendent’s decision on reconsideration shall be to superior court as provided in Chapter 36.70C RCW.

(b) Appeals from the decision of the hearing examiner on the director’s decision on reconsideration shall follow the process for the underlying permit (i.e., if the city’s code provides that the hearing examiner’s decision is a recommendation to the city council, then the city council shall make the final decision; or if the city’s code provides that the hearing examiner’s decision is final, then the hearing examiner’s decision may be appealed to superior court as provided in Chapter 36.70C RCW). (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.170 Relationship to SEPA.

(1) As provided in RCW 82.02.100, a person required to pay a fee pursuant to RCW 43.21C.060 for system improvements shall not be required to pay an impact fee under this chapter for the same system improvements.

(2) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the city’s authority to deny development permits when a proposal would result in probable significant adverse impacts identified in an environmental impact statement and reasonable mitigation measures are insufficient to mitigate the identified impact. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.180 Park and transportation facility requirements in adjoining municipalities/districts.

Level of service requirements and demand standards different than those provided in the city’s comprehensive park plan shall be applied to park and recreation facility impacts in adjoining municipalities/districts if such different standards are provided in an interlocal agreement between the city and the affected municipality. Otherwise, the standards contained in the city’s comprehensive plan shall apply to park and transportation impacts in adjoining jurisdictions. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).


20.182.190 Necessity of compliance.

A development permit issued after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be null and void if issued without substantial compliance with this chapter by the director, the department and the approving authority. (Ord. 019-17 § 18 (Exh. 1)).

20.212.010 Purpose – Findings.

The city council finds that there are within the city of Port Orchard dwellings, buildings, structures, and premises, or portions thereof, which are dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the occupants of such dwelling, building, structure or premises, the occupants of neighboring dwellings, or other residents of the city, or which are otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy, or other uses, due to: dilapidation; disrepair; structural defects; unpermitted and substandard construction or modification; lack of maintenance; abandonment or neglect; filth and other conditions attracting insects or vermin or likely to spread disease; defects increasing the risks and hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities; inadequate ventilation and uncleanliness; inadequate light or sanitary facilities; inadequate drainage; overcrowding; violations of various building, health, and safety regulations; and other conditions which are inimical to the health and welfare of the residents of the city.

Such dwellings, buildings, structures, and premises are dangerous to occupants, threaten the public health, safety, and welfare, attract and harbor vagrants and criminals, offend public values, lower the value of neighboring properties, contribute to neighborhood or community deterioration, and hamper community and economic development.

When the owners or other persons in possession or control of such properties are unwilling or unable to correct such conditions in a proper and timely manner, it is in the interest of the community and of the occupants of such places for the city to intervene and vacate, secure, correct, repair, or remove such buildings, structures, and conditions, and to pursue all legal means to recover from such persons and/or properties the costs of doing so, including the costs of staff salaries and benefits, materials, contractors, and all other legally recoverable costs and expenses. (Ord. 036-19 § 1; Ord. 023-17 § 1).

If the whereabouts of any of such persons is unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the director in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the director makes an affidavit to that effect, then the complaint may be served upon such persons by mailing a copy by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each such person at the address of the building or structure involved in the proceedings, and mailing a copy by first class mail to any address of each such person in the records of the Kitsap County assessor or auditor. A copy of the complaint shall also be filed with the Kitsap County auditor and such filing of the complaint shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law. (Ord. 036-19 § 1; Ord. 023-17 § 1).


20.212.060 Findings and order.

If the director determines that the dwelling, building, structure, or premises is dangerous or unfit for human habitation, occupancy, or use, in accordance with this chapter, he/she shall state in writing his/her findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue an order that: (1) requires the owner or party in interest, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or premises, or otherwise remove or correct the violating condition(s), so as to eliminate the threat and/or nuisance to the occupants and/or community and render it fit for human habitation, occupancy, or other appropriate or legal use, and/or to vacate and close the dwelling, building, structure, or premises, if such course of action is deemed proper on the basis of the standards set forth in POMC 20.212.040; or (2) requires the owner or party in interest, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building, structure, or premises, if this course of action is deemed proper on the basis of those standards.

(2) In working with an owner or other responsible party who has not appealed the director’s order and is working toward compliance, the director may grant additional time and/or alternative methods for achieving compliance from those initially ordered by the director. Such accommodations shall be in writing and signed by both parties, and shall be based on reasonable plans, progress, and/or assurances by the owner or responsible party, or on circumstances outside of their control, and upon reasonable interim measures implemented to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public and/or occupants of the building. Issuance of any permit for work related to the conditions addressed herein may be conditioned on such written agreement and assurances. Such accommodations and permit(s) shall be conditioned upon the continued satisfactory performance of the owner or responsible party and may be revoked by the director upon lack of satisfactory performance. The granting or revocation of such accommodations/agreements shall not be subject to appeal.

(3) Any owner or responsible party who has appealed to the hearing officer must petition the hearing officer for any subsequent modification of the time, method, materials, or other provisions of the order issued by the hearing officer, unless the hearing officer has delegated such authority to the director.

20.212.110 Emergency measures.

Whenever the director finds that any building, structure, premises, or portion thereof is an imminent hazard to the public, the building occupants, or surrounding buildings or properties, he/she may, without notice and order, take immediate action to vacate, stabilize, secure from entry, or otherwise protect the occupants, public, and surrounding properties or buildings from the hazard. Such action may include closing and vacating sidewalks, streets, and surrounding properties and buildings. The director shall, within five working days following completion of such work or action, issue a complaint pursuant to this chapter. Any city funds spent in responding to the emergency shall be included in costs recoverable under this chapter.

Any notice posted by the director, declaring a building, structure, or premises unsafe or unfit to enter or occupy may only be removed by the director or designee, or with the express approval of the director or designee. Any person who removes, alters, defaces, covers, or otherwise renders such notice ineffective, without such express approval, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 036-19 § 1; Ord. 023-17 § 1. Formerly 20.212.100).


20.212.120 Sale or disposal of materials and contents.
