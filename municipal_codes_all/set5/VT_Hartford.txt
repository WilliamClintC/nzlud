C. Conditional use approval by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, prior to the issuance of a zoning permit by the Administrative Officer, is required for development not exempted or permitted, including:
(1) New structures;
(2) Substantial improvement of existing buildings;
(3) Any fill or excavation exceeding 10 cubic yards; and
(4) Development in a floodway.
D. All development and subdivisions shall be reviewed to assure that such proposals comply with the development standards in § 58-7 of this bylaw; minimize potential flood damage; public facilities and utilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are constructed to minimize flood damage; and adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
§ 58-5 Procedures.
A. Prior to issuing a zoning permit, a copy of the application and supporting information shall be submitted by the Administrative Officer to the State National Floodplain Insurance Program Coordinator at the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation, River Management Section, in accordance with 24 V.S.A. § 4424. A permit may be issued only following receipt of comments from the Agency or the expiration of 30 days from the date the application was mailed to the Agency, whichever is sooner.
B. Adjacent communities and the Stream Alteration Engineer at the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation, River Management Section, shall be notified at least 30 days prior to issuing any permit for the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and copies of such notification shall be submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program. Any permit issued shall assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
C. A zoning permit application will be accepted by the Town as complete upon submittal of the following:
(1) Information as specified in Subsections A and B of this section;
(2) Any required certifications as specified in this bylaw; and
(3) Evidence of meeting any other requirements of this bylaw and other pertinent Town regulations, bylaws, policies and procedures.
D. Proposed development shall be permitted by the Administrative Officer or the Zoning Board of Adjustment conditioned on the receipt of all necessary permits from those government agencies from which approval is required by federal, state or municipal law.
E. All permit, conditional use, hearing, appeal, and filing processes for a permit under this bylaw must comply with all applicable requirements under the Hartford Zoning Regulations.
F. Construction must start within 180 days of the permit effective date or the permit becomes null and void.
§ 58-6 Base flood elevations and floodway limits.
A. Where available, base flood elevations and floodway limits (or data from which a community can designate regulatory floodway limits) provided by the National Flood Insurance Program in the Flood Insurance Study and accompanying maps shall be used to administer and enforce these regulations.
B. In areas where base flood elevations and floodway limits have not been provided by the National Flood Insurance Program in the Flood Insurance Study and accompanying maps, base flood elevations and floodway data provided by FEMA or available from state or federal agencies or other sources shall be obtained and utilized to administer and enforce these regulations. If no such source
of data is publicly available, it is the applicant's responsibility to develop this data.
C. Until a regulatory floodway has been mapped, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing development and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood at any point within the community.
D. Map revisions or amendments. Applicants who believe that the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or flood study incorrectly shows their property in the flood fringe or floodway must apply to FEMA to make that change. The Town or state may comment on any applications to FEMA for map revisions or amendment. The applicant must retain an engineer and/or surveyor to provide the necessary data.
(1) Applicants believing the map is wrong and their building or area where improvements are proposed is not in the hazard area shown need a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA, or conditional LOMA (CLOMA) for a proposed building. A letter of map revision (LOMR-F) from FEMA is needed if fill had been used to elevate the grade where the structure is so that it is no longer an area of special flood hazard as mapped. A conditional LOMR-F (CLOMR-F) from FEMA is needed if fill (if allowed) is proposed to elevate the structure above the base flood.
(2) When any revision or amendment is being sought from FEMA, an application to the Town under this regulation will not be considered complete until the relevant letter has been issued by FEMA. Issuance of a LOMR-F or CLOMR-F is not local permission to fill, which may only take place in compliance with this regulation.

(2) Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
LEGISLATIVE BODY
The Town of Hartford Selectboard.
LOWEST FLOOR
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of 44 CFR 60.3.
MANUFACTURED HOME
Commonly known as "mobile homes," means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.

SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA
Land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated a Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM), Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/AI-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO or V1-V30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
START OF CONSTRUCTION
Includes substantial improvement, and means the actual start date of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement as approved by the zoning permit issued. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footing, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, regardless of whether that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE
For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. "Structure," for insurance purposes, means: (a) a building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; (b) a manufactured home, also known as a "mobile home," built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation; or (c) a travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in (c) of this definition, a gas or liquid storage tank.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged conditions would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which cumulatively equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
B. Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
VIOLATION
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Article IV Minimum Standards
§ 75-24 Request for waiver; adoption of state standards.
A. Roads and streets vary in their functional use. The standards by which a highway is constructed are important to its proper functioning. As the quantity of traffic on a road increases, so must the standards change. Consequently, the standards which follow are considered minimum standards and are subject to modification by the Selectboard after a study of local conditions requiring changes. (See Figure 1 in Appendix B at the end of this chapter.)
B. Requests for waiver of any portion of these standards shall be made in writing to the Selectboard.
C. Vermont agency of Transportation Standards A76 and B71 are hereby adopted and enforced as supplemental criteria under this chapter.
§ 75-25 Right-of-way width.
The right-of-way shall be a minimum of 50 feet in width with wider slope and drainage rights-of-way if deemed necessary by the Selectboard. If possible, the center line of the road is to be located in the center of the right-of-way. The right-of-way conveyed shall intersect at least one existing Class 1, 2, 3 or state highway.
§ 75-26 Traveled way width.
A. The traveled way width of a road shall be determined by traffic flow, projected service demands and function of the roadway. The required width of the traveled way and shoulders will be identified by the following road types: Type A shall be 12 feet with four-foot shoulders; Type B shall be 10 feet with four-foot shoulders; Type C shall be 10 feet with two-foot shoulders, and Type D shall be nine feet with two-foot shoulders.
(1) Type A roads shall be used for municipal arterial highways, such arterial highways will generally be a state-aid highway that links either state or Town roads together to facilitate travel through the community.
(2) Type B roads carry our current highway standards and shall be used for the majority of Town highways. Such highways will serve as collector roads to bring traffic to the Town arterial highways and state highways.
(3) Type C roads will be used for minor local highways that serve the major collector highways. All Type A, B, and C highways will require paving of the traveled way and shoulders.
(4) Type D roads may not require paving and will only be used to connect the end of present gravel surfaced Town highways to extend such roadway.
B. Such construction will ordinarily occur when a Class 4 highway is being upgraded.
C. The road type required will be recommended to the Town Manager by the Highway Superintendent. In the event that the applicant is not in agreement with the Town Manager's decision, an appeal may be made in writing to the Selectboard.
§ 75-27 Clearing.
The right-of-way is to be cleared a minimum of 40 feet of all trees, brush and stumps. Burning shall be done in accordance with state and Town fire regulations. No fallen trees shall remain in the right-of-way. All stumps shall be removed so that base of road is on hardpan, gravel, ledge or properly compacted fill.
§ 75-28 Subgrade.
A. Ledge and boulders shall be removed to at least 18 inches below subgrade and replaced with sand or bank-run gravel.
B. All loam, muck, stumps and other improper foundation material shall be removed from within the limits of the fully extended road shoulders. In embankment areas, suitable foundation material shall be placed in one-foot layers and compacted to form a stable subgrade.
C. The subgrade surface shall conform exactly in cross section and grade to the finished road surface. Crowning and banking of curves shall be as required by the Selectboard. Compaction is required on any portion of the subgrade which has been disturbed by excavation or which has been filled during the construction of the subgrade. All ditches and drains will be constructed so that they effectively drain the subgrade prior to the placement of any base material. An additional six inches of sand cushion or proper fabric shall be placed over any clay subgrade.
§ 75-29 Wet area.
If the proposed road is in a wet area, the Selectboard or the Director of Public Works or Town Highway Superintendent may require additional gravel, sand cushion, underdrain and fabric to ensure a stable road.
§ 75-30 Subbase.
The subbase shall be composed of 18 inches of compacted gravel installed in three six-inch lifts with maximum stone size of four inches. The cross section and grade of the subbase shall conform to those of the finished surface. (See Figure 1 in Appendix B at the end of this chapter.)
§ 75-31 Base.
All streets and roads will receive a six-inch base course of compacted crushed gravel as defined by the Vermont Standard Specification Item No. 704.07A. (See Figure 1 in Appendix B at the end of this chapter.)
§ 75-32 Shoulders.
Shoulders shall be a minimum of two feet in width on a side and shall be constructed to the same specifications as the subgrade, subbase and base. Shoulders shall be a minimum of four feet at guardrail sites.
§ 75-33 Paving.
A. The roadway is to be paved within a year after construction with hot bituminous concrete mix meeting all of Vermont state highway specifications for hot asphalt bituminous concrete mix. The hot bituminous concrete is to be laid and rolled by experienced crews in two layers. The first, the three-fourths-inch binder course, to a depth compacted of two inches and the second application of three-eighths-inch top compacted to a depth of one inch. All work shall be done in a professional and workmanlike manner.
B. It is not always beneficial for the Town to require hot bituminous concrete mix pavement on all roads which are proposed for acceptance by the Town. That categorical requirement creates undesirable expense for the Town and establishes a policy which does not best serve the orderly
growth and development of roads and properties in the Town. The following criteria shall be considered by the Selectboard in determining what method of road finishing and surfacing will be required as a condition of road acceptance:
(1) Type of projected use of the proposed road. Arterial and collector roads are defined as roads which will be normally and customarily used as a course of travel to destinations other than the properties fronting upon said roads. An arterial or collector type of proposed use will normally require pavement. A nonarterial or noncollector type of proposed use only for ingress and egress to the properties fronting on or connected to said road will not normally require pavement.
(2) Density of properties served by proposed road. Where there is less than one unit per two acres fronting on or connected to a proposed road, the Selectboard may waive the required pavement.
(3) Rural or nonrural characteristics of the neighborhood in which the proposed road is located. The Selectboard will be guided by prevailing characteristics of the surrounding area as well as the proposed development in deciding whether to require pavement of a proposed road.
(4) Terrain, course, hazards and suitability of proposed road. Safety to the traveling public and inhabitants along the road shall be considered in deciding whether to require pavement and the extent and form of pavement to be required.
(5) Future foreseeable connection or intensifications of a proposed road shall be considered in determining whether and when to require pavement and what form or location of pavement or finishing to require.
§ 75-34 Crown.
The street or road shall have a cross slope from center line to edge of shoulder of 1/4 inch per foot and from the edge of street to edge of shoulder of 5/8 inch per foot for paved surfaces. Graveled surfaced streets and roads shall have a cross slope from center line to edge of shoulder of 1/2 inch per foot and from the edge of street to shoulder of 3/4 inch per foot.
§ 75-35 Ditches, culverts and headers.
A. Drainage ditches.
(1) Drainage ditches shall be provided where necessary and shall be constructed to prevent infiltration of water into the gravel subbase and to conduct storm drainage to waterways and absorption areas. Accordingly, drainage ditches adjacent to roads are normally to be at least six inches below the gravel subbase or 18 inches below finished grade to minimize spring breakup conditions. Ditches shall be shaped to prevent excessive erosion on both shoulder and right-of-way or bank sides of the ditch cross section.
(2) Open drainage ditches in excess of 5% grade shall be paved with stone or asphalt.

B. Calibration of the measurement equipment utilizing an acoustical calibrator meeting American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards shall be performed immediately prior to recording any sound data.
C. Exterior sound levels shall be measured at the property line or at any location within the property of the affected residence, school, hospital, church, public library or other sensitive-use facility. Sound measurement shall be taken in such a manner and location so that it can be determined whether sound levels are exceeded at the property line. Where practical, the microphone of the sound level meter shall be positioned three to five feet above the ground and away from reflective services. The actual location of the sound measurements shall be at the discretion of the municipal officer, agent or
employee performing the sound sampling.
D. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to refuse to cooperate with, or to obstruct, any municipal officer, agent or employee in determining the ambient sound level of a commercial, noncommercial, private or public sound source.

(1) In the event the measured ambient sound level exceeds the applicable sound level standard identified in Table I, the sound level standard (the standard against which violations are measured) shall be adjusted so as to equal the ambient sound level plus three dB.
(2) Each of the sound level standards specified in Table I shall be reduced by five dB for simple tone noises, consisting of speech and music. However, in no case shall the sound level standard be at a lower level than the ambient sound level plus three dB
(3) If the intruding sound source is continuous and cannot reasonably be discontinued or stopped for a time period whereby the ambient sound level can be measured, the sound level measured while the source is in operation shall be compared directly to the sound level standards of Table I.
B. In addition to the sound level standards established in Table I, it shall be unlawful for any person at any location to produce any amplified music or sound which causes the exterior sound level when measured at the property line of any affected single- or multiple-family residence, school, hospital, church, rest home, cemetery, public library or other sensitive use to exceed the sound level standards set forth in Table II below:

(1) The measurement shall be conducted with the sound meter level set to A-weighting and fast response. Fast response shall be used because the duration between low-frequency tones associated with amplified sound may be considerably less than one second (the average duration represented by the slow meter response). The fast meter response represents 1/8 second intervals.
(2) If separation of low-frequency tones from the background ambient sound can be determined with the sound level meter on fast response (a clearly identifiable increase in ambient sound levels corresponding to the audible bass sounds), sound levels shall not exceed an Leq of 50 dBA daytime and 45 dBA nighttime for any one-minute period.
(3) If separation of low-frequency tones cannot be determined with the sound level meter on A-weighting, the meter shall be switched to C-weighting to emphasize the low-frequency sound. If separation between low-frequency tones and ambient levels can be observed with the meter set to the C-weighting scale, the sound level from the low-frequency tone shall not exceed an Leq of 75 dBC daytime and 70 dBC nighttime for any one-minute period.
(4) If existing background sound levels (ambient sound) are higher than standards identified in Table II above, then the maximum sound levels due to amplified music shall not exceed the background sound levels by more than three dB for A-weighted measurements and five dB for C-weighted measurements.
§ 110-6 Noise disturbances.
A. In addition to and notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to willfully make or continue to cause or allow to be made or continued any loud, unnecessary, excessive or offensive noise or unusual sound which unreasonably disturbs the peace and quiet of any residential or other sensitive use or which causes discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person of a normal sensitivity in the area.
B. In determining whether a violation of the provisions of this section exists, the enforcement officer may consider any of the following:
(1) The volume and intensity of the sound.
(2) The vibration intensity of the sound.
(3) Whether the nature of the sound is usual or unusual.
(4) Whether the origin of the sound is natural or unnatural.
(5) The volume and intensity of the background sound, if any.
(6) The proximity of the sound to residential sleeping facilities.
(7) The nature and zoning of the area within which the sound is being produced.
(8) The density of the inhabitation of the area within which the sound is being produced.
(9) The time of day or night the sound occurs.
(10) The duration of the sound.
(11) Whether the sound is recurrent, intermittent or constant.
C. Violations of this section are violations of this chapter and are enforceable as provided herein.

B. Construction-related noise. If the applicant can show the Town Manager, Zoning Administrative Officer or his or her designee that, after investigation of available sound-suppression techniques for construction-related noise, immediate compliance with the requirements of this chapter would be impractical or unreasonable, due to the temporary nature or short duration of the activity for which an exception is sought, a permit to allow exception from this chapter may be issued. The approving authority must consider the following factors for construction-related exceptions, though the following list is not exclusive:
(1) Conformance with the intent of this chapter.
(2) Uses of existing property which are considered sensitive uses within the area affected by the sound for which the exception is sought.
(3) Factors relating to the beginning and completing of the work or activity.
(4) The time of day or night for which the exception is sought.
(5) The duration of the activity.
(6) The general public interest, welfare and safety.
C. Noise related to special events. If the applicant can show the Town Manager, Zoning Administrative Officer or his or her designee that the characteristics of a special event indicate that immediate compliance with this chapter would be impractical due to the type of event or unreasonable due to its temporary nature or short duration, a permit allowing exception may be issued. Special events factors for consideration shall includes at least the following:
(1) Conformance with the intent of this chapter.
(2) Uses of existing property which are sensitive uses within the area affected by the sound for which the exception is sought.
(3) Hardship to the applicant or community if not granting the exception.
(4) The time of day or night for which the exception is sought.
(5) The duration of the activity.
(6) The general public interest, welfare and safety.
D. General. If the applicant can show the Town Manager, Zoning Administrative Officer or his or her
designee that the applicant's circumstances indicate that immediate compliance with this chapter would not result in a hazardous condition or nuisance, and strict compliance would be unreasonable due to the circumstances of the activity for which the exception is requested, a permit to allow exception from this chapter may be issued. Factors to be considered in all such general requests shall include at least the following:
(1) Conformance with the intent of this chapter.
(2) Uses of existing property which are considered sensitive uses within the area affected by the sound produced.
(3) Age and useful life of the existing sound source.
(4) Hardship to the applicant or community if not granting the exception.
(5) The time of day or night for which the exception is sought.
(6) The duration of the activity.
(7) The general public interest, welfare and safety.
E. Within 10 days of the receipt of any permit application, the Town Manager or Zoning Administrative Officer or his or her designee shall either approve or conditionally approve such request in whole or in part or deny the request. In the event the exception request is approved, conditions may be imposed which minimize the public detriment and may include restrictions on sound level, duration and operation hours and an improved method for achieving compliance with this chapter and time schedule therefor.
F. If the Town Manager or Zoning Administrative Officer or his or her designee has approved an exception request, and therefore complaints are received related to the activity which was the subject of the exception, the Town Manager or Zoning Administrative Officer or his or her designee has authority to take the action deemed necessary to reduce the sound impacts which caused the complaint, which may include modification or revocation of the permit granting exception.
G. Any person aggrieved with the decision on a request for a permit for exception under this chapter may appeal the decision of the Town Manager or Zoning Administrative Officer to the Selectboard by filing a written notice of appeal with the office of the Town Manager or Zoning Administrative Officer, as appropriate, with copy to the Chair of the Selectboard within 10 days of the decision to be appealed.

treatment works at the time of enactment of this chapter;
(2) Proposed new discharge into the treatment works of pollutants from any source which would be a new source as defined in Section 306 of the Act if such source were discharging pollutants; or
(3) Proposed new discharge into the treatment works of pollutants from any source which would be subject to Section 301 of the ACT if it were discharging such pollutants.
K. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters, and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
L. All industries discharging into a public sewer shall perform such monitoring of their discharges as the Superintendent and/or other duly authorized employee of the Town may reasonably require, including installation, use, and maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting the results of such monitoring to the Superintendent. When industrial pretreatment permits are issued by the State of Vermont, monitoring records must also be submitted to the Secretary in accord with such permit. Such records of any monitoring shall be made available upon request by the Superintendent to the Secretary or to other agencies having jurisdiction over discharges to the receiving waters.
M. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.) Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.
N. Any industry held in violation of the provisions of this chapter may have its disposal authorization terminated.
O.

A. Priority. Residential, commercial, institutional and industrial facilities existing within the sewer service area on the date of adoption of this chapter which are required to be connected to the municipal sewer by the terms of this Chapter 152, or by virtue of existing pollution from the facilities to waters of the state, shall be entitled to first priority in allocation of uncommitted reserve capacity. The Town may provide for a block of capacity allocation to areas of extension of service where the extension is developer-financed. Such blocks of capacity with appropriate time limits on the commitment period would be subject to Board approval.
B. Allocation principles. Subsequent to application of the allocation priority, uncommitted reserve capacity in the wastewater treatment facility may be allocated to specific projects according to the following procedure: Once sewer permit applications have been returned to the Town office and
marked with the time and date by the person receiving the application, the Board may review the applications on a first-come-first-served basis. The total remaining uncommitted wastewater reserve capacity shall be allocated by the Board pursuant to the procedure outlined in this Chapter 152, Article III, or any other applicable provision of this Chapter 152, in such a way that there are no limitations on what total reserve amounts can be allocated in any one year as long as uncommitted capacity exists, and with no limitation of the type of development receiving the allocation, except for the following consideration: The Board may reserve a block of allocation for public facilities, a block of allocation for an area of service extension financed by the property owners or developers, or limit the amount of allocation for "wet" industry or industry with high BOD loading.
§ 152-17 Cost recovery for sewer expansion.
A. Any extension of the sewer service area to provide for new users shall be funded in the following way: The proposed users to be served by the expansion pay the entire cost of the expansion and upgrading of the sewers determined necessary and adequate by the Board.
B. Any payments made as required by Subsection A shall not be construed as payments towards treatment capacity that may be provided for the development.
§ 152-18 Application for use of plant and sewers.
A. Persons wishing to use the plant and sewers shall apply to the Board on a form prescribed by the Board. Such application shall:
(1) Be accompanied by a calculation of the development wastewater flow to be generated by the project/development;
(2) Include calculations for the volume, flow rate, strength and any other characteristics determined appropriate by the Board;
(3) Be accompanied by plans and specifications for the construction of building sewers (from the buildings to municipal sewers) and any municipal sewer extensions, including pump stations, required to service the development prepared by a Vermont registered engineer. This requirement to submit plans and specifications may be waived by the Board until final connection approval.
B. Unless waived by the Board all calculations required in Subsection A(1) and (2) above for developments generating over 1,000 gallons per day shall be certified by a Vermont registered engineer.
§ 152-19 Preliminary connection approval findings.
Upon receipt of the connection application and supportive documents, the Board may make preliminary approval of uncommitted reserve capacity upon making affirmative findings that:
A. The proposed wastewater is of domestic, sanitary origin and that there is sufficient uncommitted reserve capacity to accommodate the volume and strength of the proposed connection; or
B. The proposed wastewater is not of domestic sanitary origin and that sufficient evidence has been presented by the applicant to demonstrate that the flow and character of the wastewater is compatible with the proper operation of the plant and sewers and that the proposed wastewater will not alone or in combination with other wastes cause a violation of the discharge permit, pass through the plant without treatment, interfere or otherwise disrupt the proper quality and disposal of plant sludge or be injurious in any other manner to the plant or sewers and that there is sufficient uncommitted reserve capacity to accommodate the strength and volume of the proposed development;
C. The proposed use of wastewater capacity complies with the allocation priorities and principles and is not in conflict with any other enactment adopted by the Board or municipality.
§ 152-20 Conditions of preliminary connection approval.
A. The Board, after making the approval findings above, may issue a preliminary connection approval, which approval shall be a binding commitment of capacity to the project contingent on compliance with any conditions attached to the preliminary approval and the subsequent issuance of a final connection approval. The preliminary approval conditions may include:
(1) Specification of the period of time during which the interim connection approval shall remain valid (suggested 120 days); provisions for time extensions if approved by the Board.
(2) Incorporation of specific conditions which must be fulfilled by the applicant to maintain validity of the preliminary connection approval.
(3) Provision for revocation by the action of the Board on failure of the applicant to fulfill requirements of the preliminary connection approval.
(4) Specification that the recipient of the preliminary connection approval may not transfer, by any means, the preliminary connection approval to any other person or connect to the sewers.
B. Prior to final connection approval the following commitments shall be met by the applicant:
(1) Applicable local, state and federal permits have been secured for the development/project.
(2) Connection fees, impact fees, permit fees and other local fees or taxes all set by the Board have been paid in full to the Town of Hartford. Impact fees will be partially based on the volume and strength of the proposed wastewater flow.
(3) The plans and specifications for connection to and, if necessary, extension of the municipal sewers are acceptable to the Board.
§ 152-21 Final connection approval requirements.
A. The Board on making affirmative findings that all conditions of the preliminary connection approval and final connection approval prerequisites in § 152-20 have been fulfilled shall issue the final connection approval permit which approval may be conditioned as follows:
(1) The permit shall specify the allowed volume, flow rate, strength frequency and any other characteristics of the proposed discharge determined appropriate by the Board.
(2) The capacity allocation is not transferable to any other person or project unless requested by the original owner and approved by the Board.
(3) The construction of the connection and, if necessary, the municipal sewer extension must be overseen to assure compliance with the plans and specifications and good construction practice in a manner acceptable to the Board.
(4) Capacity allocated in conjunction with the final connection permit for building development shall revert to the Town of Hartford if the permit recipient has failed to initiate construction within one year of the issued date on the permit.
B. The permit shall expire two years from the date of issuance based on the original development plan at the time of permit approval. Within the two-year period a revised development plan and connection application may be approved by the Board in the same manner as the original. Such revised plans must also be approved under local bylaws and by the applicable state laws and regulations. If the Board approves an amended development plan and connection application, it will issue a revised final connection permit with reduced or increased capacity allocation determined in accord with the allocation priorities and principles. Where reduced capacity is granted in a revised connection permit, the capacity will revert to the Town of Hartford and the Town of Hartford may
pay to the applicant a proportional refund of connection or impact fees. Regardless of any revised development plans approved by the Board, the Board shall not approve an extension of the original two-year expiration period. After two years, the unused portion of the committed capacity allocation will revert to the Town of Hartford, and there will be no refund of connection, impact, permit or other fees.
C. Generally, the unused capacity reverting to the municipality is associated with buildings that do not at least have foundations, framing and roofs. Regardless of the permit expiration period above, the Board may order construction of the development over a longer period if this action is in the municipality's best interests.
§ 152-22 Transfer of allocation.
A. Initially reserve capacity is allocated by the Board to a specific person, project and parcel of land. The allocation is not made solely to a parcel of land and therefore does not run with the land during project completion. After completion of the project or permit expiration, however, the allocation (adjusted to the actual development constructed, if necessary) will run with the land.
B. The transfer of the capacity allocation is prohibited unless approved in writing by the Board at the original owner's request.
C. The Board may approve transfer of capacity from one project to another and one owner to another, provided that the new project and owner meets all the requirements for the final connection approval originally issued and the original owner requests such transfer.
§ 152-23 Authority to require connection.
Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting or impairing the authority of the Town of Hartford or its Board to require connections to the plant and sewers under the general laws of the state or local ordinances.

§ 160-12 Calculation of sign area.
A. Signs on panels. The area of any sign regulated under this subsection shall be calculated by measuring the smallest rectangle or other geometric shape or combination of shapes which includes
all of the display and all of the elements of the matter displayed. Frames and panels are included in this computation, but structural supports not bearing advertising matter are not included. (See illustrations of Calculating Panel and 3-Dimensional Sign Area and Area of Signs on Panel on Attachment 2 at the end of this chapter.) The area of a sign that is painted on both sides is counted only once. (See state regulations.)
B. Individual letters or graphics. Where individual letters or graphics are mounted on the surface of a building with no backing or panels, the area of a sign will be calculated by measuring the smallest rectangle or other geometric shape or combination of shapes around the perimeter of each word and figuring the area within those lines. (See illustrations of Calculating Panel and 3-Dimensional Sign Area and Area of Signs on Panel on Attachment 2 at the end of this chapter.)
C. Three-dimensional signs. The area of three-dimensional signs will be calculated as a special case of a two-dimensional sign where the widest plan view shall be considered to be the area of the sign for freestanding and projecting signs. The area will be calculated by measuring the smallest rectangle or other geometric shape or combination of shapes following the perimeter of the entire sign, graphic panels, graphic symbols, and/or physical items, and figuring the area within that perimeter. (See illustration of Calculating Panel and 3-Dimensional Sign Area on Attachment 2 at the end of this chapter.) Three-dimensional signs also are subject to the same height and projection restrictions as other projecting signs. [See § 160-10B(4). Any lettering or graphics on the top or bottom surfaces of a sign will be counted as sign area. (See illustrations of Calculating Panel and 3-Dimensional Sign Area and Area of Signs on Panel on Attachment 2 at the end of this chapter.]
§ 160-13 Calculation of number of signs.
For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered any device designed to inform or attract the attention of persons. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without an organized relationship of elements, each element shall be considered to be a single sign. (See illustration of Number of Signs on Attachment 2 at the end of this chapter.)
§ 160-14 Nonconforming signs.
Nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter may remain in use for that location, provided that the use has not been abandoned or discontinued for more than 180 consecutive days. (See § 160-11.)
§ 160-15 Changes to signs.
A. A permit is required if:
(1) The sign remains the same size, but graphics or text on the sign are altered. This permit is for the record only, and requires no waiting period for approval.
(2) A different-sized sign is replacing a permitted sign.
B. No permit is required to refresh or repair existing graphics.
C. Prior to any changes to signs, the property owner/business owner should confirm with the Administrative Officer that the existing sign is properly permitted or is a lawful nonconforming sign.
§ 160-16 Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by any action of the Administrative Officer, may appeal such action to the Town of Hartford Zoning Board of Adjustment. Such appeal shall be filed on an application form with the appropriate fee and submitted to the Clerk of the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Such notice of appeal must be filed within 15 days of the date of the decision or act and a copy of the notice of appeal shall be filed with the Administrative Officer. In deciding appeals, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may make such order or take such action, including the issuance of a permit or the revocation of same as is consistent with this chapter. The Zoning Board of Adjustment, however, may not grant variances, exemptions, extraordinary relief or otherwise alter, amend, enlarge or modify the provisions of this
chapter, it being the intent of this section to merely provide for appeals of decisions of the Administrative Officer and not to provide for variances or exceptions hereto.
§ 160-17 Civil penalty.
Any person who violates any provision of this civil ordinance shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $250. Each day the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. The Administrative Officer or other designee of the Selectboard shall be authorized to act as issuing municipal officials to issue and pursue before the Judicial Bureau a municipal complaint for a violation of this chapter. The Administrative Officer or other designee of the Selectboard shall issue a written warning for a violation of this chapter before issuing a municipal complaint for a first offense of this chapter in any calendar year.
§ 160-18 Waiver fee.
A. Waiver fee from municipal complaint. An issuing municipal official is authorized to recover a waiver fee, in lieu of a civil penalty, in the following amount, for any person who declines to contest a municipal complaint and pays the waiver fee.
(1) First offense: $25.
(2) Second offense: $50.
(3) Third offense: $75.
(4) Fourth offense: $100.

Adoption of this chapter shall be deemed to repeal such portions of the Town of Hartford Zoning Regulations adopted March 1, 1962, and any amendments thereto, which are inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.

§ 200-10 Filing of approved major subdivision plat.

B. Plat void if revised after approval. No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made in any subdivision plat after approval has been given by the Commission and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless said plat is first resubmitted to the Commission and such Commission approves
modifications. In the event that such subdivision plat is recorded without complying with this requirement, the same shall be considered null and void, and the Commission shall institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of the Municipal Clerk.
§ 200-11 Required improvements.
A. Required improvement list. The following are required improvements: monuments, lot markers, streets, sidewalks, street signs, streetlighting, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, fire hydrants, and other capital improvements as required by the Commission. The Commission may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such improvements as it considers are not requisite in the interest of public health, safety and welfare in accordance with Subsection B of this section. Where a developer expects to request the Town's acceptance of ownership of completed improvements, the Commission shall request the developer to provide a letter from the Town Manager certifying as to their satisfactory design and quality.
B. Improvements and performance bond. Before the Commission grants approval of the final subdivision plat, the subdivider shall follow the procedure set forth in either Subsection B(1) or (2) below, at the discretion of the Commission.
(1) In an amount set by the Commission, the subdivider shall either file with the Municipal Clerk a certified check to cover the full cost of the required improvements, or the subdivider shall file with the Municipal Clerk a performance bond to cover the full cost of required improvements. Any such bond shall be satisfactory to the legislative body and Town Manager, and Municipal Attorney as to form sufficiency, manner of execution and surety. A period of one year (or such period as the Commission may determine appropriate, not to exceed 30 months) shall be set forth in the bond a time within which required improvements must be completed. The certified bond or check shall include an amount required for school and/or land for public recreation purposes, as specified in these regulations; or
(2) The subdivider shall agree to complete all required improvements to the satisfaction of the Utilities Superintendent and/or the Highway Superintendent or consulting engineer, duly designated by them who shall file with the Commission a letter signed by the Town Manager signifying the satisfactory completion of all improvements required by the Commission. No sale or agreement to sell property within the development shall be made pending receipt of said letter. The Commission may waive this restriction with respect to any portion of the development in which the required improvements are satisfactorily completed and operative.
C. Modification of design of improvements. If at any time before or during the construction of the required improvements it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Utilities Superintendent/Highway Superintendent that unforeseen conditions make it necessary or preferable to modify the location or design of such required improvements, the Utilities Superintendent/Highway Superintendent may, upon approval of the Commission, authorize modifications, provided that these modifications are within the spirit and intent of the Commission's approval and do not extend to the waiver or substantial alteration of the function of any improvements required by the Commission. The Utilities Superintendent/Highway Superintendent shall issue any authorization under this section in writing signed by the Town Manager and shall transmit a copy of such authorization to the Commission at their next regular meeting.
D. Inspection of improvements. At least five days prior to commencing construction of required improvements the subdivider shall notify the Utilities Superintendent/Highway Superintendent of his intention to commence construction.
E. Proper installation of improvements. If the Utilities Superintendent/Highway Superintendent shall find, upon inspection of the improvements performed before the expiration date of the performance bond, or the lifting of restrictions against sale, that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with plans and specifications filed by the subdivider, he shall report to the Town Manager who will advise the legislative body, Administrative Officer and Commission. The
legislative body then shall notify the subdivider and, if necessary, the bonding company, if any, and take all necessary steps to preserve the municipality's rights. No plat proposed by that subdivider shall be approved by the Commission as long as the subdivider is in default on a previously approved plat or agreement.
F. Maintenance of improvements to be dedicated to the Town. The applicant shall be required to maintain improvements and provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks until acceptance of said improvements by the legislative body. The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the legislative body, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the appropriate Town authority in a form satisfactory to the legislative body and Municipal Attorney in order to assure that the Town's rights are protected in case the improvements deteriorate during the following two-year period due to improper construction by the applicant.
§ 200-12 Public acceptance of streets and recreation areas.
A. The approval by the Commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or be evidence of any acceptance by the municipality of any street, easement, or other open space shown on such subdivision plat.
B. When a school site, park, playground, or other recreation area is to be submitted for acceptance by the municipality, the Commission shall require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. The Commission may also require the filing of a written agreement between the applicant and the legislative body covering future deed and title, dedication, and provision for the cost of grading, development, equipment, and maintenance of any such area.

All land to be subdivided shall be, in the judgment of the Commission, of such a character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to public health or safety, or to the environment. Land subject to periodic flooding, poor drainage, inadequate capability to withstand structures, including streets, utilities, buildings, or other hazardous conditions, shall not ordinarily be subdivided.
B. Energy conservation. In order to conserve energy all subdivisions shall use the least areas of roadway and the least length of sewer, water and utility lines within environmental and economically sound limits. Buildings should be sited so as to take advantage of southeast, south and southwest orientations where practical. Landscaping should be effectively used providing wind barriers and reducing heat loss and heat gain. Cluster development should be encouraged wherever feasible and desirable.
C. Reserved strips. No privately owned reserved strip, except on open space areas, shall be permitted which controls access to any part of the subdivision or to any other parcel of land from any street, or from any land dedicated to public use, or which may be so dedicated.
D. Lot layout. The layout of lots shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Regulations in force, and shall be appropriate for the intended construction. Corner lots should have extra width to permit a setback on each street. Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to straight streets or radial to curved street lines. Considerations in lot layout shall be given to topographic and soil conditions.
E. Preservation of existing features. Due regard shall be given to the preservation and protection of
existing features, trees, scenic points, brooks, streams, rock outcroppings, water bodies, other natural resources, and historic resources.
§ 200-15 Streets.
A. Layout. The arrangements of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the continuation of principal streets in any adjoining subdivision or for their proper projection when adjoining property is not subdivided in order to create a logical system. When an Official Map which includes planned future streets has been adopted by a town, subdivisions may be required by the Commission to conform to that map. Streets may be dedicated or served in the locations and widths shown on the Official Map as a condition of plat approval. Where the subdivision borders on an existing street and the Comprehensive Plan or Official Map indicates plans for realignment or widening of the street that would require reservation of some land of the subdivision, the Commission shall require that such areas be shown and marked on the final plat "Reserved for Street Realignment (or Widening) Purposes."
B. Topography. Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce usable lots, reasonable grades and safe intersections in appropriate relation to the proposed use of the land to be served by such streets.
C. Access. Year-round graveled or paved access shall be available for fire, ambulance and police vehicles to within 100 feet of the principal entrances to multifamily dwellings, commercial or industrial establishments, and institutions.
D. Dead-end streets and turnarounds. A dead-end street shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length, shall meet at least minimum width requirements as set by the Town street construction specifications. Where a road issues from a turnaround to serve more than one residence (and therefore is not a driveway) the portion of such road which serves more than one residence must be added to the length of the dead-end street, and the sum of the two segments may not exceed 1,200 feet. Where more than one such road issues from a turnaround, the imitation of 1,200 feet shall apply to the dead-end segment plus the longest of such common-use segments issuing from the turnaround. The limit on maximum length may be waived by the Commission where terrain factors would result in a second access being unreasonably expensive to construct and such waiver can be justified by large lot sizes and limitations on resubdivision. A turnaround shall be provided at the end of dead-end streets in a form approved by the Highway Superintendent.
E. All new streets shall comply with Chapter 75, Highway Specifications, which is in effect at the time of construction.
F. Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of existing streets. Other streets shall be named in accordance with Zoning Regulations. Where names are required they shall be shown on the proposed subdivision plat.
G. Access road. If the access road to the subdivision is a private road, the Commission may require the subdivider to improve the access road to municipal highway construction standards in accordance with Chapter 75, Highway Specifications. Such improvement shall provide no implied obligation on the municipality to accept ownership and responsibility for future maintenance of said road. If the access road to the subdivision is a Class-4 Town road, the Commission may require its upgrading at the developer's expense and subdivision may be conditional upon approval of the road-class change by the legislative body.
H. Curbs and sidewalks. Curbs and sidewalks may be required on at least one side of all streets by the Commission in any subdivision where the density is greater than one residential unit for each two acres unless waived by the Commission, and the curbs and sidewalks may be required on both sides of a street, if deemed necessary by the Commission. Curbs may be required when the density is one residential unit for each two acres of land or less, if deemed necessary by the Commission. If
sidewalks or curbs are required by the Commission, construction must conform to specifications provided and approved by the Highway Superintendent.
§ 200-16 Pedestrian/bicycle access.
Where necessary, in the judgment of the Commission, rights-of-way for pedestrian/bicycle travel and access may be required to facilitate pedestrian circulation within the subdivision and to provide access to public property.
§ 200-17 Utilities.
A. Easements. The Commission may require that any underground utilities be placed in the street right-of-way between the paved roadway and street line. Where inclusion of utilities in the street right-of-way is impractical, perpetual, unobstructed easements 20 feet in width shall be provided with satisfactory access to the street.
B. Extension of municipal utilities. All subdivisions shall make adequate provisions for water supply, stormwater and sanitary sewage disposal, and required utilities and improvements. The Commission may require the extension of public waters and sewers to and within a proposed subdivision, without cost to the municipality where existing lines are, in the judgment of the Commission, within a reasonable distance of the proposed subdivision. In such circumstances the municipality may elect to oversize the trunk line extension in anticipation of further extension to other areas. If this option is exercised the cost borne by the municipality will be limited to the additional equipment cost, excluding installation, incurred by the developer over what he would have incurred in construction solely for his own development. This figure must be agreed between the developer and the official responsible for the municipal system before approval of the final subdivision plat is granted. Where the proposed subdivision is located on an existing water and/or sewer line, the Commission shall determine whether off-site capacity is available to service the proposed subdivision.
C. Connection to municipal utilities. The subdivider shall install laterals from all utilities to the street property line of each building lot. Any residential buildings constructed in the subdivision shall have house connections installed, and have such connections extended inside of the building. All such utility system installations shall be at the expense of the subdivider.
D. Depth of utility mains. Water and sewer mains must be laid below the depth of frost penetration of the area. Sewer lines shall be set lower than water mains.
E. Water supply improvements.
(1) For subdivisions which will connect to a public municipal water supply system, the Commission may require written certification from the Town Manager that system capacity is adequate to serve the anticipated requirements of the proposed subdivision. Applications for extensions to the municipal system shall be approved by the officers and agents of a municipality entrusted with the care and superintendence of a municipal water supply system.
(2) The Commission may require that a private water supply system unconnected to municipal systems be designed in such a way that it may eventually be connected to a public municipal water supply system.
(3) Water supply systems shall meet the requirements of any applicable municipal or state health regulations.
(4) The following standards shall be met for those subdivisions which will have community water systems for the entire development:
(a) Due consideration shall be given to the drainage patterns in the area.
(b) Building sites and new roadways shall be located far enough away from underground water
concentrations, or surface areas which take in water, to prevent runoff from roads or leachage from septic systems from contaminating water supply.
(c) Buildings and septic systems shall be located sufficiently above flood water levels and high groundwater areas to prevent the pollution of surface water.
F. Sewage disposal improvements.
(1) For subdivisions which will connect to a municipal sewage disposal system, the Commission may require written certification from the Town Manager that system capacity is adequate to serve the anticipated requirements of the proposed subdivision. Applications for extensions shall be approved by the officers and agents of a municipality entrusted with the care and superintendence of a municipal sewage disposal system.
(2) The Commission may require that a private sewage disposal system unconnected to municipal systems be designed in such a way that it may be connected eventually to a municipal sewage disposal system. Private sewage disposal systems shall meet the requirements of any applicable municipal or state health regulations.
(3) Septic systems shall meet the requirements of any applicable municipal or state health regulations.
G. Streetlighting. Streetlights shall be installed according to lighting and spacing standards, if any, as established by the legislative body.
H. Electric, telephone, cable TV. The subdivider shall coordinate the subdivision's design with the utility companies. Such plan shall be integrated with a systematic program for distribution of service to the entire area around the subdivision now or in the future. Common rights-of-way shall be utilized whenever possible and, when technology and terrain make it economically feasible, distribution systems should be built underground.
I. Fire protection. Adequate fire protection facilities within the subdivision shall be provided by the developer to the satisfaction of the Fire Chief and a letter from the Town Manager certifying such adequacy supplied to the Commission. When a subdivision is served by a municipal water system, such letter will also certify the adequacy of supporting off-site fire water systems, available water volumes, pressures, etc.
§ 200-18 Drainage improvements.
An adequate surface stormwater drainage system for the entire subdivision shall be provided. The subdivider may be required by the Commission to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previous to or as a result of the subdivision. A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that additional runoff incidental to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility so that there will be drainage to private property or an increase in the expenditure of public funds, the Commission shall not approve the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said condition. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse or drainageway, there shall be provided a stormwater drainage easement of such width as to encompass the twenty-five-year flood area of such watercourse, which easement shall be indicated on the final plat.
§ 200-19 Open space and recreation areas.
A. For the use of subdivision residents. The Commission may require as one of the criteria for approval that each subdivision contain adequate provision for the recreation needs of its residents. However, except for the special provisions which apply to planned unit developments, the Commission may not require the reservation of more than 15% of the land area for such purposes. In some subdivisions the reservation of open space for common use may be considered by the Commission as adequate fulfillment of this obligation; in other subdivisions the installation of recreation facilities
may also be required.
B. For the use of the public. Where a proposed development is designed for more than 100 dwelling units, or where the proposed development plus prior developments by the same developer approved after the effective date of regulation total more than 100 dwelling units, an obligation to contribute to the Town toward the cost of a public recreational facility shall apply, unless waived in writing by the legislative body. This obligation shall consist of the current market value of an area equal to 10% of the area of the subdivision, located in a section of the Town designated by the legislative body, representing the average of appraisals by three real brokers chosen by lot by the Planning Commission from all real estate brokers with offices within the Town. The cost of which shall be borne by the developer. Land may be accepted in settlement of this obligation at the discretion of the legislative body, but such land may not also apply in meeting minimum area per family criteria in the Zoning Regulations, nor satisfaction of the 50% undeveloped area requirement in the Zoning Regulations. Prior developments by the same developer include units constructed by family members or corporations owned or controlled by the developer or family members. If the obligation is settled by cash payment, its use by the Town is limited to recreation purposes, current or future, but is not limited to land acquisition. This cash contribution shall be set aside in a special account and shall only be used for recreation purposes.
§ 200-20 School site contribution.
A. Where a proposed development is designed for more than 100 dwelling units, or where the proposed development plus prior developments by the same developer approved after the effective date of this regulation total more than 100 dwelling units, an obligation to contribute to the Town for a school site shall apply, unless waived in writing by the Board of School Directors. The obligation shall be determined by the following formula:
Square feet of active public school site within the Town at recent date*
Proposed student population at recent date
x
1.5 x No. of dwelling units
NOTE:
*
From data supplied by the BOSD.
B. If the land area so determined is too small for a school site or the developer's site is not satisfactory to the Board of School Directors for school expansion, for any reason, the obligation may be satisfied by cash payment to the Town as follows: square feet of obligation times estimated land cost per square feet in general area of the Town designated by the BOSD. This cash contribution shall be set aside in a special account and only be used for school purposes.
C. The estimated land cost will be the average of appraisals by three real estate brokers chosen by lot by the Planning Commission from all real estate brokers with offices within the Town, the cost of which shall be borne by the developer.
D. Where a portion of a developer's land is offered and accepted in satisfaction of this obligation, such portion may not also apply in meeting minimum area per family criteria in the Zoning Regulations, nor in satisfaction of the 50% undeveloped area requirement in the Zoning Regulations.
E. Prior developments by the same developer include units constructed by family members or corporations owned or controlled by the developer or family members.
§ 200-21 Site preservation and improvements.
A. Natural cover. Land shall be subdivided and improved in reasonable conformity to existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill, and to retain, insofar as possible, the natural contours, limit stormwater runoff and conserve the natural cover and soil. After application for
approval has been made to the Commission, no topsoil, sand or gravel shall be removed from the subdivision for any other purpose than to meet construction needs for that particular subdivision or to meet any requirements of these regulations.
B. Shade trees. The Commission may require that suitable hardwood shade trees (such as sugar maples, Norway maple, red maple, ash or oak), be planted along streets where trees do not exist. All trees shall measure at least 10 feet in height and at least two inches in diameter measured at a point six inches above finished grade level. All trees are to be planted a minimum of eight feet from the street line at intervals to be specified by the Commission.
C. Erosion and sediment control. The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time during development. Land should not be left exposed during the winter months. Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/or mulching and structural measures may be required by the Commission to protect areas exposed during development. Sediment basins shall be installed and maintained on site to remove sediment from land undergoing development and from runoff water.
D. Excavation and grading (exclusive of streets and roads covered by § 200-15E). The entire area of work shall be brought to the required lines and grades by excavation or filling. A minimum of four inches of topsoil shall be provided to cover all finished slopes. Materials for embankment shall be placed in successive horizontal layers not exceeding six inches in depth. They shall be thoroughly compacted. The Commission shall require embankments to be planted with stabilizing shrub or ground cover and seeded with a deep-root grass to prevent erosion.
§ 200-22 Subdivision organizations and restrictions.
When a development involves common ownership of community facilities, open spaces, or other commonly held property, a management organization to operate and maintain these facilities shall be required by the Commission. A prospectus shall be submitted by the subdivider describing this organization, its financing and membership, which must meet the approval of the Commission.
Article V Required Submissions
§ 200-23 Sketch plan.
The sketch plan, two copies of which must be presented to the Administrative Officer by noon on the fourth working day preceding the Planning Commission's meeting, shall show the proposed layout of streets, lots, and other features sketched roughly on a print of a survey of the property.
§ 200-24 Minor subdivision plat.
In the case of a minor subdivision, the subdivision plat shall include, or be accompanied by, the following information:

Article VI Variances and Waivers
§ 200-26 Variances.
Where the Commission finds that extraordinary and unnecessary hardships may result from strict compliance with these regulations or where there are special circumstances of a particular plat, it may vary these regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secure, provided that such variations will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Municipal Development Plan or the Zoning Regulations.
§ 200-27 Waivers.
Where the Commission finds that, due to special circumstances of a particular plat, the provision of certain required improvements is not requisite in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare, or is inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent or in proximity to the
proposed subdivision, it may waive such requirements, subject to appropriate conditions.
§ 200-28 Conditions.
In granting variances, waivers, and modifications, the Commission shall require such conditions which will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the requirements so varied or modified.

Article V Immobilization of Parked Vehicles
§ 220-20 Immobilization of vehicle.
Any unattended motor vehicle found parked at any time upon any public highway or parking areas of the Town of Hartford, the owner of which has accumulated four or more unpaid parking tickets and has failed to respond may be immobilized by the Hartford Police Department in such a manner as to prevent its operation, providing notice that the vehicle in question is subject to immobilization is sent to the registered owner by first-class mail at least 15 days prior to immobilization. No such vehicle shall be immobilized by any means other than by the use of a device which will cause no damage to such vehicle unless the vehicle is moved while the device is in place. In addition to any outstanding fines, the owner of such immobilized vehicle shall be assessed a $35 immobilization fee.
§ 220-21 Notice to owner.
A. At the time of immobilization, the Hartford Police Department shall cause to be placed on such vehicle, in a conspicuous manner, notice that the vehicle has been immobilized and that any attempt to move such vehicle might result in damage to such vehicle.
B. The owner of any vehicle that has accumulated four or more parking tickets, and has failed to respond, shall be notified by first-class mail that if all tickets are not paid within 15 days the vehicle will be immobilized if found in any Town parking area or on Town property and may face additional financial penalties.
§ 220-22 Release of vehicle.
The owner of such immobilized vehicle, or other duly authorized person, shall be permitted to secure the release of the vehicle upon the payment to the Hartford Police Department of all outstanding fines, plus the immobilization fee of $35.
§ 220-23 Failure to remove immobilized vehicle.
Any vehicle which is immobilized and is not removed from its public parking location after 24 hours shall be subject to towing by the Hartford Police Department. Any vehicle towed will be inventoried, and wrecker fees shall be the responsibility of the registered owner.
§ 220-24 Tampering with immobilization.
It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to remove or damage or attempt to remove or damage any immobilization device. The fine for such an offense shall be $500, plus the cost of repairs or replacement of any damaged device.
§ 220-25 Post-immobilization hearings.
As to any vehicle immobilized pursuant to this article, a person who has a legal entitlement to possession of the vehicle shall be entitled to a post-immobilization administrative hearing to determine whether or not there is sufficient cause to immobilize the vehicle. In order to exercise that right, the person must, within 10 days after such person learns of the immobilization, serve written demand for a hearing upon the Hartford Police Department, 66 VA Cutoff Road, either in person or by first-class mail. Such demand shall state the name, address, and telephone number, if any, of the person making the demand and the vehicle registration number on the immobilized vehicle.
§ 220-26 Conduct of hearing.
A. A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer within 48 hours of receipt of a written demand therefor for the person seeking the hearing, unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and Town holidays shall be excluded from the calculation of the forty-eight-hour period. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be whether or not there is sufficient cause to immobilize the vehicle in question.
B. The hearing officer shall be the Town Manager or a Town grand juror designated by the Town Manager to act in his stead.
C. "Sufficient cause to immobilize" shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was sufficient breach of the local ordinance to grant legal authority to immobilize the vehicle.
D. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the vehicle. The Hartford Police Department shall carry the burden of establishing that there is sufficient cause to immobilize the vehicle in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle (if not the person requesting the hearing).
§ 220-27 Decision of hearing officer and its effect.
A. The hearing officer's decision in no way affects any criminal proceedings in connection with the immobilization in question; any criminal charges involved in such proceedings may only be challenged in the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final. Failure of the registered or legal owner or his/her agent to request or attend a scheduled post-immobilization hearing shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right of such hearing.
B. In the event that the hearing officer finds no sufficient cause, the hearing officer shall so inform the Hartford Police Department; the Hartford Police Department shall release the vehicle if it has not already done so, and no immobilization fee shall be charged.
§ 220-28 Grievance procedure.
If a citizen believes that he/she has unfairly received a parking violation ticket, he/she may appeal in writing to the Parking Enforcement Officer, supplying name, address, telephone number and appropriate times in which to be contacted, as well as an explanation of the appeal. If the citizen is not satisfied with the disposition rendered by the Parking Enforcement Officer, he/she may appeal in writing to the Chief of Police. The decision of the Chief of Police will be final.
§ 220-29 Fine for parking violations.
The penalty for all parking violations shall be $7 for each offense if paid or postmarked within 72 hours of the violation. After 72 hours the fine shall be $14.

B. Word usage. Shall is mandatory; may is permissive.
§ 245-4 Purpose; effect of extensions on existing users.
A. It is the purpose of this chapter, and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, to provide an orderly procedure for all applicants which will assure timely review and acceptance of properly constructed waterworks utility extensions and connections. It is adopted under the authority of 24 V.S.A. §§ 2291(6) and 3313.
B. The existing users will continue to be responsible for the required system operation and maintenance including general purpose prioritized local capital improvements to the system. All other extensions, additions or proposed improvements that are required for or requested by new users will be the financial responsibility of those new users. After construction, testing and acceptance by the Department, these new extensions, additions, or proposed improvements shall become the property of the Town of Hartford.
C. It is specifically the purpose of these procedures to assure that existing users do not sacrifice any standard of service for the benefit of new users connecting to the system. Any reductions in service created by expansion into new areas will be evaluated considering the total impact on the entire system. Where an impact causes any potential reduction in the standards of service to existing users, new users requesting connections will be required to complete such system improvements to eliminate any such impacts as a condition for obtaining a water connection permit.
§ 245-5 Public extensions.
Subject to the condition that the Town be supplied with proof of compliance with all applicable provisions of this chapter and any appendix to this chapter, all extensions, improvements or additions to the water system shall become the property of the Department. Private systems shall not be allowed connection to the Town water system. All design documents and construction procedures shall comply with the duly accepted Town standards as set forth in the rules and regulations of the Water Commissioner and in the standard specifications for each.
§ 245-6 Resident inspections.
A. During construction, a resident inspector appointed by the Board under the sole supervision and direction of the Town may be required. All cost of resident inspection will be borne by the applicant. It will be the duty of the resident inspector to assure installation of all facilities in accordance with the approved plans and specifications for the project. Certification of project conformance by the resident inspector and the applicant's engineer will be required in order to obtain permission from the
Department to initiate water service for the project. Any divergence from the approved plans must be approved by the appropriate Board.
B. Where required the Department will provide persons for conducting inspections. The developer or owner shall notify the Department at least 24 hours in advance of such required inspections.
C. The developer will be responsible for direct costs of providing an inspector by the Department.
§ 245-7 Application procedure.
Applications will be presented to the Superintendent in a form that provides full information necessary for adequate review of the proposed project.
A. Preliminary application.
(1) Because the water systems are limited by the capacity for service, the first step in obtaining an approval for a proposed project is to receive a capacity commitment from the Department. If there is no capacity commitment, an application for full approval will not be accepted until such time as the project is either reduced to meet capacity reserves or more capacity is constructed within the system.
(2) A preliminary application must include information necessary for the Board of Water Commissioners to make a judgment on the capacity of the existing system to provide the capacity requirement of that project. Included will be location of the project, projected water demands, proposed sizes of lines and a general utility layout. A connection fee will accompany all preliminary applications. (See schedule of changes.) Though detailed plans are not required at this stage, information must be complete enough to enable the Board to make a decision. If capacity commitment is given, a detailed submission of plans will be required before approval for construction.
(3) Water system capital facilities charges.
(a) Properties subject to water system capital facilities charges and effective dates.
[1] All structures not occupied before January 1, 1989, shall be subject to water system capital facilities charges except as provided under Subsection A(3)(b). For determining date of occupancy for new structures, the date of the certificate of occupancy will govern.
[2] All structures that have experienced a change of use after January 1, 1989, that require additional demand for water and/or sewer services shall be subject to water system capital facilities charges except as provided under Subsection A(3)(b). New connection and/or capacity charges will apply solely to the additional demand.
(b) Transition rule. To provide a fair transition from the existing to new charges, the following are exceptions to subject properties under Subsection A(3)(a):
[1] All structures that have received approval for connection or additional demand as of January 1, 1989, will not be subject to water system capital facilities charges if they are connected and receive a certificate of occupancy before July 1, 1989.
[2] All occupied structures which have or receive a certificate of occupancy before January 1, 1989, will not be subject to water system capital facilities charges if they are connected by July 1, 1989.
(c) Water system capital facilities charges: [Amended 7-14-1992]
[1] Applicants intending to connect to the Town's water system shall pay an initial water system capital facilities charge in addition to all other fees and charges which are in effect. The water system capital facilities charge shall be computed at the rate of $2 per gallon per day on the total gallonage
to be allocated.
[a] Residential rates. Residential water and wastewater rates shall be based on a daily water usage for a home in Hartford at 169 gallons.
[b] Commercial and industrial rates. Commercial and industrial water and wastewater users shall be assessed an initial impact fee equal to 40% of the "State Chart" gallonage figure. At the end of a three-year period, the commercial or industrial user's peak quarterly water use will be determined to adjust the impact fee assessment upward or downward to reflect the actual gallonage used.
[2] The amended rates shall apply to all applications received on or after July 1, 1992.
(d) Payment policy. The water system capital facilities charges shall be paid as follows:
[1] Ten percent upon application for gallonage requested to be reserved, on forms provided by the Town. This fee in nonrefundable unless the project is abandoned as a result of being denied necessary state or local permits.
[2] On or before two months from the date of said application, the applicant shall enter into a contract with the Town to reserve and purchase water capacity.
[3] If any state or local permits are required on a project for which a water system capital facilities charge has been assessed, an additional 40% of the fee shall be paid within 18 months from the date of the contract in Subsection A(3)(d)[2], or the date of receipt of the last required permit, whichever first occurs. If such permit or permits are denied, or if the applicant abandons a project before the start of construction because of permit denial, or for any other reasons, the contract, if entered into, will be deemed null and void. Any payment made, except the 10% paid upon application (as per Subsection A(3)(d)[1]), shall be returned without interest, and reservation of gallonage shall be withdrawn. For the purpose of this policy, the applicant shall be deemed to have abandoned a project if he fails to enter into a contract within two months of the application and payment in Subsection A(3)(d)[1], or when he fails to commence construction within 18 months from the date of the contract, or make the payment required in Subsection A(3)(d)[4].
[4] The remaining 50% for each unit is due prior to receiving a zoning permit for construction for that unit.
[5] Projects may be phased by agreement between the Town and the applicant, or when required by the Town because of low or insufficient plant or system capacity. If a contract is made for one phase, allocation of gallonage therein provided shall be only for such phase, and the Town shall not thereby be deemed to have bound or committed itself, impliedly or otherwise, to enter into contracts for additional phases or to provide gallonage therefor, nor shall the consumer be deemed bound or committed to construct future phases. Such contract shall be binding only for the project therein described as if no other phases were intended, and the water system capital facilities charges shall be computed only for such phases. If a contract describes more than one phase of a total project, then the water system capital facilities charges shall be computed on the whole described project and shall be payable as provided here, except that the payment of 50% in Subsection A(3)(d)[4] shall be paid in proportion to such phases and prior to receiving zoning permits for construction of each phase, but no later than the termination date stated in the contract.
[6] Applicants who desire to construct residential buildings not located in, or part of planned development or for which no contract and/or permit is necessary or required, shall pay 10% of the water system capital facilities charges upon application (as per Subsection A(3)(d)[1]) and shall pay the remaining 90% prior to receiving a zoning permit for construction or within 18 months of application.
[7] The practice of the issuance of capacity letters, so-called, is hereby discontinued. Applicants who
hold such letters, whether or not they have entered into a contract with the Town, but who have not paid a water system capital facilities charge on the effective date of this policy, shall be given written notice thereof by the Town, and shall pay the applicable portion of any unpaid water system capital facilities charges herein provided within 60 days of the date of such notice or upon entering into a contract with the Town, whichever first occurs. The time limit provisions mentioned in Subsection A(3)(d)[3] shall also apply to all such applicants. Applicants who fail to pay may have existing contracts, if any, terminated and any gallonage actually allocated to them withdrawn.
(e) Appeals: Appeals from the assessment of impact fees shall be made in writing within 30 days to the Selectboard. [Added 7-14-1992]
(f) Expenditure of impact fee revenues: [Added 7-14-1992]
[1] The Town shall provide an annual accounting for each impact fee showing the source, amount of each fee collected and project that was funded with the fee. The Town must spend the fee on the capital project, for which the fee was intended, within six years of when the fee was paid. If the Town fails to do this, the owner of the property at the expiration of the six-year period may apply for and receive a refund of his or her proportionate share of that fee during the year following the date on which the right to claim the refund began.
[2] The property owner shall be entitled to interest from the date of payment(s) to the Town at a rate equal to the interest rate paid the Town while the funds were on deposit in the Town's impact fee account.
B. Full application.
(1) A full application will be prepared by the applicant in compliance with the standard specifications of the Town of Hartford on forms provided by the Department. All plans are to be prepared in accordance with these design standards. Two sets of design plans and specifications will be submitted to the Board by the applicant. The Board will review all plans and specifications for conformance with its standards. This review will be made where applicable by the Town's duly appointed engineer. The Superintendent may take the following actions:
(a) Approval for construction.
(b) Conditional approval for construction.
(c) Request for additional information or review comments.
(2) Acceptance of the application by the Superintendent obligates the applicant to pay the Department its established rates and charges and to comply with the rules and regulations. If the rendering of service requires a new service connection or other work on the premises, the occupant must present to the Department a permit in writing from the owner authorizing the utility to enter the premises to do the necessary work.
(3) The Department reserves the right to assign size and location for the water service. Applications will be accepted subject to there being an existing main in a street or right-of-way abutting on the premises to be served, but acceptance shall in no way obligate the Department to extend its mains to service the premises, except as hereinafter provided.
§ 245-8 Procedure for initiation and extension of water service.
The Superintendent will consider acceptance of the utility project for initiation of water service only after all of the following conditions have been met, with appropriate documentation submitted to the Superintendent and found to be satisfactory by the Board:
A. Certification of the Resident Inspector and project engineer of conformance with the standard
specifications, rules and regulations and approved plans and specifications.
B. Presentation of all deeds and right-of-way instruments for all new water mains.
C. Presentation of as-built plans on reproducible Mylar, 24 inches by 36 inches, or such other size as may be required to enable recording of the Mylar in the records of the office of the Hartford Town Clerk, if required, showing ties to all fittings, valves, corporations, curb stops and boxes, and stubs.
D. Statement of release of all liens from all subcontractors and suppliers.
E. Certification to the leakage test, pressure test and chlorination procedures and results of successful bacteriological sampling. Temporary water shall be supplied by the Department only for these activities.
§ 245-9 Conformance with other regulations.
The proposed project may be required to obtain other permits. The securing of final approval of the project does not remove the responsibility of obtaining other permits, such as public building permits, zoning and planning permits, Act 250, or opening of street permits. The applicant is advised to seek advice in compliance with all permits.
§ 245-10 Compliance standards.
All applications will comply with the following:
A. Rules, Regulations and Specifications of the Board of Water Commissioners.
B. Water Service District Restrictions.
C. American Water Works Association Standards, latest revision.
D. Ten State Standards, 1987 or latest revision.
E. Vermont Department of Health Public Water System Regulations.
F. Vermont Standards for Water System Design and Construction.
G. National Plumbing Code, 1968 or latest revision.
§ 245-11 Internal improvements.
A. Whenever a proposed water main extension, improvement or addition to the utility causes any other portion of the system to be inadequate or places such impact on that existing portion of the system that it renders that portion of marginal serviceability, it shall be required that the proposed project include such improvements required for the existing system to eliminate such impacts.
B. The internal improvements shall be made in conformance with the overall master plans of the Department and the Municipal Development Plan. The improvements will be determined by the Board in conformance with the master plan and after analysis of the total hydraulic effect on the system.
§ 245-12 Water District service areas.
A. The Board of Water Commissioners has adopted a defined Water District. This district shall be defined by the map entitled "Water Service Areas" and recorded with the Town Clerk and attached hereto as part of these procedures (610 feet MSL grade line).
B. It is the purpose of service district to confine the distribution area to elevations that can be effectively served by the existing supply system. It is further the purpose of the district to eliminate extensive expansion of the utility until such time as development within the district has been
undertaken. Current capacity of the utility recognizes that the existing serviced areas can utilize all of the current capacity when fully developed. It is the policy of the Board to phase needed improvements to the system to coincide with capital improvement revenues.
C. Upon application to the Board approvals for extension may be granted provided that the Board determines the following:
(1) The extension does not negatively affect any existing users; or
(2) The existing system can be modified to allow the extension without negative effect to existing users; or
(3) Adequate source, supply, storage, or distribution exists or can be reasonably modified to accommodate the extension without negative effects on the existing users.
§ 245-13 Meters.
A. All water service by the Department shall be sold on the basis of meter measurements, or as otherwise provided for in its rate schedules, and the Department may install meters whenever deemed expedient. The customer may receive water through a meter upon written application to the utility. The size of the meter will, in all cases, be determined by the Department.
B. All meters shall be set, as nearly as possible, at the point of entrance of the service pipe to the building, and the customer shall provide and maintain a clean, dry, warm and accessible place to service the meter. Meters, once set, may be moved in location at the request of the customer at his expense, and the work may be done only by an agent of the Department.
C. For new installation of meters two inches and larger in nominal size, the piping arrangement shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Department.
D. Remote reading registers acceptable to the Department may be utilized. If provided by the Department primarily to expedite its meter reading and billing procedures, the installation shall be at the Department's expense.
E. When the customer fails or neglects to furnish a suitable location for a meter inside his building, or when for other reasons it is necessary or expedient to locate the meter outside the building, an underground vault acceptable to the Department shall be provided and maintained at the expense of the customer.
F. Use of service pipe material which is deemed by the Department to be inferior shall constitute ground for requiring the use of a meter installation at an exterior location.
G. Meter repairs and replacements necessitated by ordinary wear will be paid for by the Department. Those caused by freezing, hot water, or by other causes within the control of the customer will be charged to the customer, including the cost of removing and replacing the damaged meter.
H. Meters will be carefully tested before installation. Thereafter, meters will be tested free of charge at the request of the customer, provided that such request is not made more frequently than once in 12 months.
I. If tests are requested more than every 12 months, the Department may require the customer to make a deposit which will cover the reasonable cost of the test. If the meter is found to overregister more than 2%, the deposit will be refunded together with the percentage of error computed for the duration of the last billing period. If the meter is found to underregister more than 2%, the customer will be charged such percentage of error computed for the duration of the last billing period. If the meter registers with 2%, plus or minus, it will be deemed correct, and the deposit will be retained by the Department. The customer may be present when the Department conducts the test on his meter, or if
he desires, send an expert or other representative appointed by him. A written report giving the result of such test shall be made to the customer.
J. Metering shall be required in all connections. Meters are to be obtained and installed by the owner in conformance with the Department standards. Once installed and approved by the Department, the meter will be solely the responsibility of the Department, and all maintenance and replacement will thereafter be borne by the Department. (See meter standard.)
K. Every service must be provided with an operable stop-and-waste valve inside the building near the service entrance, easily accessible, and protected from freezing. All piping shall be so arranged as to prevent back-siphonage and to permit draining whenever necessary. Backflows will be required.
§ 245-14 Installation of service.
A. The cost of installing and maintaining the pipe from the curb stop to the property shall be borne by the owner. This pipe may be installed by a private contractor, but the installation must comply with Department specifications and may not be covered until it is inspected and approved by the Department. No new installations may be made nor further connections made to existing installations unless approved by the Board.
B. Existing connections to the municipal water system shall remain connected to the water system, unless express permission is granted by the Board for disconnection.
C. The Department shall not be responsible for damage due to escaping water or arising from the use of water or from any damage arising from leaks in piping or equipment.
D. All new construction shall use low-flow-type water fixtures as approved by the Department.
§ 245-15 Temporary service.
A. Contractors, builders and property owners desiring temporary water service for construction purposes shall make application in writing to the Department and secure approval for this service. Temporary water services will be supplied, provided that it does not interfere with use of water for general purposes. The cost of temporary service and the cost of its removal shall be borne by the applicant. The estimated cost of temporary service shall be payable in advance by a deposit at the Department. Upon completion of the use of temporary service an accounting shall be made. If the amount of deposit does not cover the actual cost, the applicant will be billed the additional amount. If the deposit exceeds the actual cost, the applicant shall be refunded the difference.
B. These charges are in addition to the charge for use of water which will be billed at the published rate.
§ 245-16 Summer service pipes and mains.
Summer service connections and mains are ones which, because of a lack of a sufficient cover or for other reasons, can supply premises for only a portion of the year. Water furnished through summer service pipes and mains will be furnished only from May 1 to October 1, except that the Department may render service before and after these dates if deemed advisable. Service furnished later than November 1 via a summer service or main shall be by written agreement between the Department and the customer.
§ 245-17 Seasonal customer.
A seasonal customer is one who regularly takes service for only a portion of the year from either a summer or year-round service. Except as provided below, a seasonal customer will be subject to the rules and charges of seasonal rates in effect. A customer regularly vacating his premises for three months or less may elect in writing to be classified as an annual customer subject to normal changes 12 months of the year notwithstanding any requested temporary suspension of service.
§ 245-18 Winter provisions.
The Department shall not be required to install any service lines or service connections during winter conditions, except by special arrangement, in which case the customer shall pay for the excess over
normal costs. In those cases where customer-owned service pipe or main is frozen, the thawing shall be done by the owner at the expense of the owner. If it is determined that the freezing is between the main and the curb stop, it shall be the responsibility of the Department to restore service. To avoid a recurrence, the Department may order an examination of the customer's service pipe or main and if the same is not a depth of 5 1/2 feet, as required, the Department reserves the right to require it to be so relocated before service is resumed.
§ 245-19 Abatement of charges in cases of vacancy of premises.
If premises are to be vacated for a period of 30 days or more, abatement of water charges may be had by notifying the Department in writing, in advance, the date such vacancy is to occur. The Department will then discontinue service at the shutoff or in case two or more occupancies are supplied by a single service, seals will be placed upon the stop-and-waste valve or fixtures of the vacant occupancy. A charge will be made for each resumption of service, and a charge will be made for each seal required. No abatement will be granted for flat hose charges, or to customers subject to seasonal rates, or to regular vacaters electing to pay for 12 months' service. Abatement will not be available for partial vacancy of multiple units served through a single meter with normal minimum charge for that size meter.
§ 245-20 Sprinkler systems.
A. Application for new sprinkler systems must be made by the owner of the property or his authorized agent and will be subject to all provisions and specifications of the Department. The Fire Department is hereby made party to this review.
B. The applicant must furnish a complete set of drawings showing the location of the premises to heads and other appurtenances. These plans will remain as property of the Department. The applicant further agrees to furnish the Department with drawings showing revisions to piping or appurtenances whenever any revisions are made.
C. No private fire connection will be made on a water main of less than six inches in diameter. The Department expressly reserves the right to determine the necessity for the advisability of granting any application for special service, depending on the size of the street main, availability of pressure, and the nature and capacity of the fire protection equipment to be installed.
D. Installation of the fire protection service shall be by, or under the direction of, the Department. All charges therefor are payable by the customer.
E. All fire services shall be subject to periodic inspections by the Department. The owners of such systems will give the Department inspectors all reasonable facilities for making the inspection and any information concerning such system that they may require. Inspections will be made with as little inconvenience to the owner as possible.
F. Sprinkler system connections shall be used for fire protection only. Using water from fire supply for other than fire protection purposes may result in prosecution for unauthorized use.
G. Backflow devices or FM-rated meters are required.
§ 245-21 Fire hydrants.
A. Hydrants are the property of the Department. All public fire hydrants and their connections are installed and maintained by the Department.
B. No person or persons shall obstruct the access to any fire hydrant by replacing or permitting snow, debris or building material or other obstruction to remain on or about the hydrant which will in any manner interfere with its immediate use.
C. Public fire hydrants are for the sole purpose of fire protection and, with exception of the Fire Department operating of the same for the legitimate purpose of extinguishing fires or conducting a bona fide drill or practice, no other use shall be made without consent of the Water Department.
§ 245-22 Liability of Department for damage in case of service interruption.
A. The Department furnishes water, not pressure, and does not guarantee a continuous supply. No responsibility will be assumed for any damage to any apparatus in any house or building due to shutting off water or providing excess pressure without notice either for:
(1) Repairs; or
(2) Pipeline breaks; or
(3) Necessary operations; or
(4) Malfunction of system facilities.
B. No persons shall be entitled to damages, not to have any portion of a payment refunded for any stoppage occasioned by accident to any portions of the water works, nor for stoppage for purposes of additions or repairs, nor for nonuse occasioned by absence or any other reason, unless the interruption is in effect for a continuous period in excess of 10 days, in which case a proportional refund will be made.
C. Notice of interruption of service is not required. While it is the intention to give notice, as far as possible, in advance of any work which must be done that will necessitate interruption of the supply, such notice is to be considered a courtesy only, and not a requirement on the part of the Department. In case of a break in a pipeline, water may be shut off without notice. Any announcement will be by general announcement in the local newspaper. Failure of tenant or property owner to receive notice of interruption of service shall entail no liability on the part of the Town of Hartford, the Department or its employees. Property owners should install range boilers, hot water tanks and all other equipment connected with the water supply system in such a manner that damage will not occur if the water is shut off without notice.
D. The Department will attempt to maintain adequate system pressures and will not be required to render service where normal system pressures may be expected to fall below 35 pounds per square inch. Where a superintendent determines that the system pressures within the range provided are higher than the customer's plumbing or apparatus can endure, it shall be the responsibility of the customer to install a suitable pressure-reducing device. Pressure-reducing devices are recommended when the service pressure exceeds 45 psi. Pressure reduction devices are required when service pressure exceeds 60 psi.
§ 245-23 Unauthorized use of water.
A. No person shall in any way or by any device obtain the use of water without authorization, including the operation of any valves by repairmen and plumbers or others for any purpose.
B. No customer shall be allowed to furnish to other persons or property Department water nor to charge for such supply.
C. Water shall not be allowed to run to waste through any faucets or fixtures to prevent freezing or kept running for any longer than necessary for its proper use. The Department is required to restrain and prevent any and all waste of water and to that end may, when necessary, turn off the water or take such other action as, in its judgment, appears proper. The Board of Water Commissioners shall have the authority to limit the use of water from time to time when conditions so warrant.
D. The Department reserves the right, in periods of drought or emergency or when deemed essential to the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, to restrict, curtail, or prohibit the use of water for secondary purposes, such as sprinkling, car washing, or filling swimming pools, and shall have the right to fix the hours and periods when water may be used for such purposes.
E. Inspectors of the Department or persons so authorized by the Department shall have free access at all
reasonable hours to all parts of every building for the purpose of inspection, removing or replacing meters, examining fixtures, and observing the manner in which water is used.
F. After service has been shut off because of customer's failure to abide by any of these regulations, it shall not be turned on until a written request for service has been submitted to and approved by the Department.
§ 245-24 Developments.
A. Any realtor, developer, contractor or builder or any person or group of persons who wish to supply a subdivision or development either within or outside the existing water service area shall make a written application to the Board as detailed under § 245-7, Application procedure.
B. All development, subdivision or multibuilding piping shall be built to the specifications of the Department, the Vermont Health Department, Vermont Department of Water Resources, Environmental Protection Agency and any other state or federal agencies having jurisdiction of same. The Department's engineer may review such designs as directed by the Department.
C. Service boundaries shall be defined by the Department, and the furnishing of water shall be at the discretion of the Board of Water Commissioners and as further defined in the special district provisions herein.
D. Developments and subdivisions to and within which water distribution mains, service piping and hydrants are constructed to specifications of the Department and agencies mentioned in the above subsection shall, upon the approval of the Board, be accepted as part of the Department's system from date of acceptance and thereafter. All provisions of § 245-8 must be met.
E. The cost of extensions shall be borne by the customer to such extent as shall be determined by the Selectboard, and a contract shall be executed by the customer prior to the commencement of the extension or further installation.
F. The Department shall at no time jeopardize its current customers by authorizing more new water services than it can supply.
G. General.
(1) All work shall be in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Board. These documents shall be in conformance with the standard specifications for waterworks.
(2) Fire protection shall be provided for all developments including any waterline extensions longer than 600 feet from existing hydrants owned by the Department. Flow requirements shall be in accordance with the master plan for the Department and with the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) criteria.
§ 245-25 Violations and penalties.
A. Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter shall be served by the Town with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
B. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit provided for shall be punished as provided in Chapter 1, § 1-16, for each violation. Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense.
C. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the Town for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned the Town by reason of such offense. The extent, loss or damage shall be taken to be the extent determined by a competent registered professional engineer particularly skilled in the operation and maintenance of wastewater collection and treatment works.
D. In addition to invoking the penalties hereinabove provided and otherwise available, including all legal and equitable remedies, the Commissioners are authorized to order abatement of any violation and to provide in said order that failure to abate said violation shall require termination of all use and occupancy of any building not in compliance with this chapter. A property owner receiving a notice of abatement shall be entitled to a public hearing upon request prior to the commencement of any occupancy termination.

Article I Authorities and Authorizations
§ 260-1 Enactment; authority; title.
In accordance with the Vermont Planning and Development Act, hereinafter referred to as the "Act," 24 V.S.A. Chapter 117, §§ 4401 and 4402, there are hereby established Zoning Regulations for the Town of Hartford which are set forth in the text and map that constitute these regulations. These regulations shall be known and cited as the "Town of Hartford Zoning Regulations."
§ 260-2 Intent.
It is the intent of these Zoning Regulations to provide for orderly community growth and to further the purposes established in Section 4302 of the Act. No provision of these regulations may have the effect of excluding from the municipality housing to meet the needs of the population as determined in accordance with 24 V.S.A. § 4382(c) [24 V.S.A. § 4412(1)(A)].
§ 260-3 Administrative Officer.
A. The Selectboard shall appoint an Administrative Officer from nominations submitted by the Planning Commission for a term of three years in accordance with the Act (24 V.S.A. § 4448). The Selectboard may remove an Administrative Officer for cause at any time after consultation with the Planning Commission.
B. An Acting Administrative Officer may be appointed by the Selectboard, from nominations submitted by the Planning Commission, who shall have the same duties and responsibilities of the Administrative Officer in the Administrative Officer's absence. In the event an Acting Administrative Officer is appointed, the Selectboard shall establish clear policies regarding the authority of the Administrative Officer relative to the authority of the Acting Administrative Officer.
C. The Administrative Officer shall literally administer and strictly enforce the provisions of these regulations, and in doing so shall inspect development, maintain records, and perform other related tasks as is necessary and appropriate.
§ 260-4 Zoning permits.
A. No land development, as defined in § 260-59, may be commenced without a permit therefor issued by the Administrative Officer. No zoning permit may be issued by the Administrative Officer except in conformance with these regulations and Flood Hazard Area Regulations, if applicable.
B. Applications for zoning permits shall be made to the Administrative Officer on forms provided for that purpose within six months from the date of Planning Commission approval of the project. Failure to apply for a permit within the six-month period will render the Planning Commission approval invalid.
C. Prior to the issuance of any zoning permit, the Administrative Officer shall first be satisfied that the subject of the application is in conformance with these regulations and Flood Hazard Area Regulations, if applicable, and shall be satisfied that all applicable impact fees and/or other charges imposed by the Town have been paid or that arrangements have been made to pay them at such future time as may be allowed under the respective Town ordinance. The Administrative Officer may request from an applicant any information necessary for this purpose. No such permit shall be issued unless an application, fee, plot plan and any other approvals of the Planning Commission or the Board of Adjustment required by this regulation and § 58-4 of Chapter 58, Flood Hazard Area Regulations, if applicable, have been properly obtained and are submitted in connection with the application. The Administrative Officer shall, within 10 working days of the submission of application, approvals by the Planning Commission or Zoning Board of Adjustment, if applicable, and receipt of all supplementary information requested, either issue or deny a zoning permit. If denied, the Administrative Officer shall so notify the applicant in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the zoning permit is approved, all activities authorized by its issuance shall be started within six months and completed within two years of its date of issue, or the zoning permit shall become null and void and reapplication to complete any activities shall be required. Any activities not completed within the above permit period shall be subject to any ordinance in effect at the time of reapplication. One six-month extension to both time periods may be granted by the Planning Commission. The start of activities, as referred to above, shall consist of excavation or nonreversible site preparation, such as the cutting of trees.
D. In the issuance of zoning permits, the Administrative Officer shall comply with all the provisions of 24 V.S.A. § 4424, Shorelands; flood or hazard area; special or freestanding bylaws, and 24 V.S.A. § 4449, Zoning permit, certificate of occupancy, and municipal land use permit, if applicable, of the Act.
E. The fee for a zoning permit shall be established by the Selectmen. Said fee shall accompany each application for a permit.
F. No permit issued pursuant to this section shall take effect until the time for appeal as defined in 24
V.S.A. § 4465 has passed; or in the event that a notice of appeal is properly filed, no such permit shall take effect until adjudication of that appeal by the appropriate municipal panel is complete and the time for taking an appeal to the Environmental Court has passed without an appeal being taken. If an appeal is taken to the Environmental Court, the permit shall not take effect until adjudication by the Environmental Court.
G. The zoning permit or a copy of the zoning permit as furnished by the Administrative Officer shall be posted by the applicant at the site for which the permit is issued so that it is conspicuous.
H. An interested person may appeal any decision or act taken by the Administrative Officer by filing a notice of appeal with the Secretary of the Zoning Board of Adjustment through the Town's Municipal Office. This notice of appeal must be filed within 15 calendar days of the date of the decision or act, and a copy of the notice of appeal shall be filed with the Administrative Officer. A notice of appeal shall be in writing, submitted on the form provided by the Town, and shall include the name and address of the appellant, a brief description of the property with respect to which the appeal is taken, a reference to the regulatory provisions applicable to that appeal, the relief requested by the appellant, and the alleged grounds why the requested relief is believed proper under the circumstances.
§ 260-5 Certificates of occupancy.
A. Following receipt of a zoning permit, it shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any land development, as defined in Article VI, until a certificate of occupancy is issued by the Administrative Officer stating that the proposed use of the structure or land conforms to the requirements of these regulations and Flood Hazard Area Regulations, if applicable. This shall not apply to zoning permits issued expressly for the subdividing of land.
B. Applications for a certificate of occupancy shall be made to the Administrative Officer.
C. Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy, the Administrative Officer shall first determine that the proposed use of the structure or land conforms to the requirements of these regulations and Flood Damage Prevention Bylaw, if applicable.
§ 260-6 Violations and penalties.
Any violation of these regulations shall be subject to fines and enforcement as provided in §§ 4451 and 4452 of the Act.
§ 260-7 Public notice.
Any requirement of public notice pursuant to these regulations shall be given by the publication of the date, place and purpose of such hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town of Hartford and the posting of such notice in one or more public places within the municipality not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing. In every case in which public notice is required, such public notice shall include a brief summary of the purpose of the hearing.
§ 260-8 Amendments.
These regulations may be amended according to the requirements and procedures established in §§ 4441 and 4442 of the Act.
§ 260-9 Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare. Except for § 4413 of the Act and where, in these regulations, specifically provided to the contrary, it is not intended by these regulations to repeal, annul or in any way impair any regulations or permits previously adopted or issued; provided, however, that where these regulations impose a greater restriction upon use of a structure or land than is required by any other statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, permit, easement or agreement, the provisions of these regulations shall control.
§ 260-10 When effective.
These amendments shall take effect in accordance with the voting and other procedures contained in § 4442 of the Act. On the day they are effective, they shall amend in its entirety the ordinance entitled "Town of Hartford, Vermont, Zoning Regulations," adopted March 1, 1962, and last amended April 18, 2006.
§ 260-11 Severability.
The invalidity of any article or section of these regulations shall not invalidate any other article or section thereof.

B. The Zoning Map entitled "White River Junction, Design Review District Boundary Map, First Floor Commercial Use Boundary Map" is hereby incorporated into these regulations as the official map to delineate the White River Junction Design Review District described in § 260-45 of these regulations, and the official map delineating the area in the Central Business District which is restricted to commercial uses only for the first floor street frontage portion of buildings, as described in § 260-20 of these regulations.
§ 260-13 Copies of Zoning Maps.
Regardless of the existence of other printed copies of the three Zoning Maps referenced in § 260-12, which from time to time may be made or published, the official Zoning Maps, which shall be located in the office of the Town Clerk, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of the land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the Town.
§ 260-14 District boundaries.
District boundaries shown within the lines of roads, streams and transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the center lines. The abandonment of roads shall not affect the location of district boundaries. When the Administrative Officer cannot definitely determine the location of a district boundary by such center lines, by the scale or dimensions stated on the Zoning Map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, the Officer shall refer the matter to the Planning Commission, which shall interpret the location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the Zoning Map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of these regulations.
§ 260-15 Permitted uses.
Permitted uses are those which may be approved by the Administrative Officer, providing the standards established by these regulations are met. Permits for permitted uses will be issued by the Administrative Officer. However, where a variance or other special action by the Zoning Board of Adjustment is required, or where approvals of a site development plan is required by the Planning Commission, the issuance of permits by the Administrative Officer must await and is contingent upon such approval.
§ 260-16 Conditional uses.
Conditional uses are those for which a permit may not be issued by the Administrative Officer until such use has been approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment after public notice and hearing, as provided for in § 4414(3) of the Act. In addition, certain specified uses and structures which exceed the limits which would otherwise apply to them under these regulations may apply for approval as a conditional use. No clearing of land or construction of access roads shall occur in preparation for a conditional use until approval for such use has been granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
A. Approval criteria. In order for the permit to be granted, the applicant shall be required to present
evidence that the proposed use shall not result in an undue adverse effect on any of the following such that an impact cannot be reasonably mitigated:
(1) Community facilities.
(a) The capacity of planned or existing community facilities, including, but not limited to:
[1] Emergency services.
[2] Municipal water or sewer system.
[3] Recreational facilities.
[4] The school system.
[5] Solid waste disposal facilities.
(b) The Board may seek or require input from the Town Manager and other municipal officials regarding relevant facilities. The Board shall also take into account sections of the Municipal Plan and any duly adopted Capital Plan which specify anticipated growth, service standards, and facility construction plans.
(2) The character of the area, as defined by the objectives of the zoning district within which the project is located and specifically stated polices and standards of the municipal plan, including, but not limited to:
(a) Scenic or natural beauty, historic sites, or rare and irreplaceable natural areas.
(b) Compatibility with scale and design of structures existing in that area.
(3) The capacity of roads and highways in the vicinity to safely accommodate expected traffic flows. In making this determination, the Board may require submission of a traffic impact study made by a professional traffic engineer.
(4) Any Town of Hartford bylaws in effect.
(5) Utilization of renewable energy resources.
B. Approval conditions.
(1) In permitting a conditional use, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may impose conditions found necessary to meet the stated objectives of the zoning district and protect the best interests of the surrounding property, the neighborhood, or the Town as a whole. These conditions may include, but need not be limited to, the following:
(a) Increasing the required lot size or setback distance;
(b) Limiting the coverage or height of buildings;
(c) Controlling the location and number of vehicular access points;
(d) Increasing the number of off-street parking or loading spaces;
(e) Limiting the number, location and size of signs;
(f) Requiring landscaping and screening in certain areas;
(g) Specifying a time limit for construction, alteration, or enlargement for a structure to house the proposed use;
(h) When the project will cause the level of traffic service on a road or street to drop below a Level C (AASHTO Standards), requiring that the project make a contribution proportionate to the project's share of the excess traffic. Such contribution may include:
[1] Installation of acceleration or deceleration lanes on the street or highway adjacent to any driveway, frontage or service road;
[2] Improvements to access or other intersections affected.
(i) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may require applications for Conditional Use Approval and/or Variances to have professional site plans prepared by Surveyors, Engineers or Architects licensed by the State of Vermont.
(j) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may require the submission of a bond, escrow account, or other surety in a form acceptable to the Town to assure one or more of the following: the completion of the project, adequate stabilization, or protection of public facilities that may be affected by a project.
(2) The Board may require that no zoning permit, except for any permits that may be required for infrastructure construction, may be issued unless the streets and other required public improvements have been satisfactorily installed in accordance with the approval decision and pertinent bylaws. In lieu of the completion of the required public improvements, the Board may require for the benefit of the municipality a performance bond or other security issued either by a bonding or surety company approved by the legislative body or by the owner with security acceptable to the legislative body in an amount sufficient to cover the full cost of those new streets and required improvements on or in those streets or highways and their maintenance for a period of two years after completion as is estimated by the Town. This bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public, the completion of any improvements that may be required within the period fixed in the subdivision bylaws for that completion and for the maintenance of those improvements for a period of two years after completion. Any costs incurred by the Town related to the performance bond or other securities are the responsibility of the applicant and/or property owner.
(3) The performance bond required by this subsection shall run for a term to be fixed by the Board, but in no case for a longer term than three years. However, with the consent of the owner, the term of that bond may be extended for an additional period not to exceed three years. If any required improvements have not been installed or maintained as provided within the term of the performance bond, the bond shall be forfeited to the municipality, and upon receipt of the proceeds of the bond, the Town shall install or maintain such improvements as are covered by the performance bond.
C. Changes to an approved use.
(1) Any enlargement or alteration of a conditional use shall be reviewed as a conditional use by the Zoning Board of Adjustment to permit the specifying of new conditions. Exemptions: amendments to an approved conditional use which, in the opinion of the Chair or Vice Chair of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Administrative Officer, are minor and have no adverse effect in terms of the approval criteria outlined in Subsection A. Changes which involve a variance will not be considered minor.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in Article V, a change in use, expansion or contraction of land, area, or alteration of structures or uses which are designated as a conditional use within the district in which they are located and are existing therein prior to the effective date of these amendments shall conform to all regulations herein pertaining to conditional uses, and shall not be commenced unless and until a permit is issued by the Zoning Board of Adjustment for such change, expansion, construction or alteration under this section.
§ 260-17 Accessory uses.
Accessory uses are those uses which are not specifically listed for a zoning district in § 260-20 and are on the same lot with and of a nature which the Administrative Officer determines is incidental and subordinate to the principal use or structure. Appeals from the Administrative Officer's determination may be made to the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
A. Accessory uses shall not significantly alter:
(1) The character of the area affected;
(2) Traffic on roads and highways in the vicinity;
(3) The principal use of the property.
B. If the principal use on a lot requires a conditional use permit, any accessory use shall also require a conditional use permit. If the principal use on the lot is a permitted use, the accessory use shall also be permitted.
§ 260-18 Dwelling unit density.
In every case, the Administrative Officer shall determine the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on any lot by dividing the lot size, provided by a survey (furnished by the owner and sealed by a Vermont registered land surveyor), by the minimum area per dwelling unit standards for the district in which the lot is located. In all cases such determination shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
§ 260-19 Classification of lots, source of water and sewage service.
A. The tables set forth in § 260-20 make reference to the "class" of lot, a distinction which is based on the means by which a lot receives potable water and/or sewage disposal service. The classes are follows:
Lot Classification
Provision for Water and Sewage
1
Off-lot water supply and sewage disposal
2
Off-lot water supply or sewage disposal
3
On-lot water supply and sewage disposal
B. Generally, but not exclusively, off-lot water supply and sewage disposal service is provided through municipal facilities. On-lot water supply is usually from a well, spring, brook or other source on or near the lot. On-lot sewage disposal systems are usually an engineered septic tank and leach field arrangement on or near the lot.
§ 260-20 District objectives and land use control.
A. The tables in Attachments 1:1 through 22:1 establish the objectives of each of the districts hereby established and the provisions of these regulations that apply respectively in each district. Any use designated as a "Permitted Use" in the table relating to a particular district may be commenced in such district pursuant to § 260-15 of this regulation. Regulations establishing a classification of lots in certain districts for the purpose of establishing the minimum area per dwelling unit of such lots and the minimum lot size of such lots are set forth in the following tables.
B. In addition to those uses specifically listed in the tables, the following are also permitted in all districts:
(1) Accessory use to any permitted or approved conditional use.
(2) Planned development.
(3) Home occupation.
EDITOR'S NOTE: THE TABLES OF PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES BY ZONING DISTRICT ARE INCLUDED AT THE END OF THIS CHAPTER AS ATTACHMENTS 1:1 THROUGH 22:1.
§ 260-21 Overlay Districts.
A. Purpose. The Hartford Master Plan identifies many areas throughout the Town that encompass significant natural resources and have particular importance to the Town's rural character. These areas make Hartford a special place and represent the Town's heritage of working farms and forest lands as part of a sustainable, environmentally sound, local-resource-based economy. These areas include such features as prime and statewide agricultural soils, forests, wetlands, riparian areas, steep slopes, important wildlife habitat, scenic views, ridgelines and hillsides. Since they are located in multiple zoning districts, and the characteristics of these areas vary, special overlay zoning districts are established in sections of the Town to ensure sufficient protection of these important features. It is not the Town's intent to prevent development in the overlay districts, but rather to have appropriate placement of development to minimize impacts on these areas as much as possible.
B. General provisions for Rural Lands, Agricultural, and wildlife Connector Overlay Districts.
(1) Objective: to promote the preservation of the rural character, sensitive features and natural resources, including prime agricultural soils, wetlands, steep slopes, important wildlife habitat, scenic views, ridgelines and hillsides, in the Rural Lands, Agricultural, and Wildlife Connector Overlay Districts.
(2) Effect on existing regulations. These overlay district standards are intended to supplement the development regulations and standards set forth in the underlying zoning districts, and shall not repeal or alter any existing ordinances, regulations, or bylaws of the Town of Hartford except as provided herein.
(3) District boundaries. These standards shall apply to all land within the Rural Lands Zoning Districts (RL-1, RL-3, RL-5, RL-10 and FC) referred to as the "Rural Lands Overlay District," and all lands within the Agricultural and Wildlife Connector Overlay Districts as identified in the most recently adopted Hartford Master Plan.
(4) Supplemental development standards.
(a) All development and subdivisions should be laid out so they integrate carefully into the natural resources while protecting and minimizing fragmentation of land, and adverse visual and environmental impacts on these natural resources. To achieve this, the following supplemental standards shall apply:
[1] Subdivisions creating two or more new lots will meet major subdivision requirements, including a detailed mapping of natural resources. Given the extent of sensitive natural resources, the Planning Commission may require a planned development for the site in accordance with § 260-47 of these regulations.
[2] Development envelopes and associated development shall be located down-slope of ridgelines and prominent hills in areas where ridgelines and hillsides are easily visible from existing roadways, and shall be considered relative to the availability of less visible locations on-site. Additional landscaping may be required to screen development to reduce visibility.
[3] When locating structures, roads, driveways, utility corridors and rights-of-way, one or more of the following should be employed:
[a] Place improvements at the wooded edge and/or nearby developed areas. If not possible, place improvements in a manner that minimizes encroachment in wooded areas and open fields.
[b] Follow existing contours, roads, tree lines, and stone walls.
[c] Share roads, driveways, utility corridors and rights-of-way.
[d] Place developments and subdivisions close to roads.
[e] Follow established settlement patterns.
[4] Locate development such that it will not conflict with existing agricultural uses in the area, and provide adequate buffers between potentially conflicting uses.
[5] Create an efficient use of land that results in cluster development, small networks of utilities and roads, and large sections of unfragmented land.
[6] Any other rules and regulations that the Planning Commission may prescribe to supplement these standards, provided these rules and regulations are not inconsistent with the Zoning Regulations.
(b) In addition to the overlay district general provisions set forth in these regulations, the following additional provisions specific to the Agricultural and Wildlife Connector Overlay Districts shall be followed.
C. Agriculture Overlay District.
(1) Objective: to promote the continuation of agriculture, retain the maximum possible amount of agricultural lands, which often provide important scenic views, protect historically viable farmland and prime and statewide agricultural soils, and preserve Hartford's rural character, scenic characteristics, including open lands, views, and working landscape qualities in accordance with the Hartford Master Plan.
(2) Supplemental development standards. In addition to the general provisions for all overlay districts specified in Subsection B above, all development and subdivisions involving lands in an Agricultural Overlay District are subject to the following supplemental standards:
(a) Development envelopes shall be located at field edges or, in the event that no other land is practical for development, on the least fertile soils in order to minimize the use of productive agricultural land and impacts on existing farm operations.
(b) Buildings should be clustered to avoid the fragmentation of productive farmland/open land.
D. Wildlife Connector Overlay District.
(1) Objective: to provide sufficient area for animals to move freely between conserved lands, undeveloped private lands, contiguous forest habitat, and other important habitat, land features, and natural communities within and beyond the boundaries of the Town in order to meet their necessary survival requirements.
(2) Supplemental development standards. In addition to the general provisions for all overlay districts specified in Subsection B above, all development and subdivisions involving lands in a Wildlife Connector Overlay District are subject to the following supplemental standards:
(a) Development will be encouraged close to roads and/or developed areas to allow sufficient wildlife corridors through the area.
(b) A buffer area of adequate size from the edge of development shall be established to ensure the protection of critical wildlife habitats and travel corridors.
(c) Written review from the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife regarding the impact of the proposed development on the wildlife corridor and significant wildlife habitats when requested by the Planning Commission for site development plan and subdivision applications or by the Administrative Officer for zoning permits.
E. Application review procedures.
(1) Site development plan and subdivision applications. As part of a site development plan or subdivision application, all commercial, industrial, multifamily residential development or subdivision applications in overlay districts are required to demonstrate how the proposed project adheres to the overlay districts standards addressed in Subsection B above. Wireless communication facilities in compliance with § 260-39 are exempt from meeting this requirement.
(2) Administrative review process. Except for exemptions identified in Subsection E(3) below, residential uses, including new single-unit dwellings, and two-unit dwellings, residential additions, and accessory structures are required to submit an administrative application to the Administrative Officer indicating how the proposed project adheres to the overlay districts standards addressed in Subsection B above. If the Administrative Officer determines that the application adheres to the supplemental development standards as applicable in Subsections B(4), C(2) and D(2), the permit will be issued. However, if the Administrative Officer determines that the applicable development standards cannot be met, the application will be denied. The applicant may then submit a notice of appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment as described in § 260-4H of these regulations.
(3) Exemptions. The following uses are exempt from the administrative review process for overlay districts. However, building/zoning permitting requirements and all other zoning regulations apply.
(a) Agricultural buildings.
(b) Residential additions with a building footprint less than 500 square feet.
(c) Attached garages with a building footprint less than 500 square feet.
(d) Accessory structures, including pools and hot tubs, less than 250 square feet in area and less than 10 feet in height.
(e) Attached decks less than 500 square feet.
Article III General Provisions
§ 260-22 Lots.
A. Setbacks. There shall be no structures erected within required setback areas. Every part of a required setback shall be open from grade level to the sky, unobstructed, except for:
(1) Projection of sills, cornices, pilasters, steps, chimney and eaves from a structure a maximum distance of two feet into the setback;
(2) Projection of wheelchair access ramps from a structure into the setback a maximum of half the setback width;
(3) Fences which comply with the limitations set forth in § 260-28 below;
(4) Freestanding signs which comply with the limitations set forth in the Hartford Sign Ordinance;
(5) Aboveground fuel storage tanks which are fully screened from any public roadway or adjacent property.
B. Measurement of lots and setbacks.
(1) On public rights-of-way 50 feet or more wide, the front setback shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way. On public rights-of-way of less than 50 feet or of undetermined width, the front setback shall be measured from a line 25 feet away from the center line of the traveled portion of the roadway.
[Image]
(2) Any corner lot shall need to meet front setbacks on any side adjoining a street or right-of-way and side setbacks for the remaining sides. For an odd-shaped lot, the Administrative Officer shall determine which setbacks apply on which sides.
(3) For the purpose of determining setbacks, a lot with access from a private right-of-way will be considered to front on the lot line where the right-of-way gives access to the lot.
(4) The depth of a lot shall be considered to be the distance between the midpoints of straight lines extending across the lot at the foremost and rearmost points of the side lot lines.
(5) The width of a lot shall be considered to be the distance between straight lines connecting front and rear lot lines at each side of the lot, measured across the rear of the required front setback.
[Image]
[Image]
(6) The Planning Commission shall determine the method of measurement for odd-shaped lots at the time subdivision approval is granted.
C. Lots in two zoning districts. Where a district boundary divides a lot of record at the time such line is adopted, the regulations for the less restricted part of such lot shall extend 30 feet into the more restricted part, provided the lot has frontage on a street in the less restricted district. In Rural Lands Districts, this distance shall be 100 feet.
D. Reduction in lot area. No lot shall be so reduced in area that the area, setbacks, lot width, frontage, coverage or other requirements of these regulations shall be smaller than herein prescribed for each district. The provisions of this section shall not apply when part of a lot is taken for a public purpose.
E. Double-counting not allowed. Space required under these regulations to satisfy area, setback or landscaping requirements in relation to one structure shall not be counted as part of an area, setback or landscaping requirement for any other structure.
F. Obstruction of vision. On corner lots, there shall be no obstruction to vision between 30 inches and 10 feet above the ground in the area which lies within 25 feet of the point where the edges of the two traveled ways intersect.

§ 260-23 Structures.
A. Height.
(1) Except for farm structures and windmills with blades less than 20 feet in diameter and structures in
the CB-2 and I-C-2 Zoning Districts, structures shall not exceed a height of 40 feet. Building height shall be measured from the proposed finished grade at the front of the building to the highest point of the roof for flat or mansard roofs, or to the midpoint between the eaves and ridgeline for other roofs. Rooftop apparatus such as air-conditioning units, antennas and solar collectors shall be included in the measurement.
(2) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a conditional use permit for structures which exceed a height of 40 feet, providing such an increase will not be disruptive to its surroundings or create a hazard. In the CB-2 and I-C-2 Zoning Districts, structures up to 60 feet high do not require a conditional use permit, provided the structures meet fire safety requirements established by the Hartford Fire Department.
B. Principal structures on lots. In Residential and Rural Lands Districts, there shall be only one principal structure on a lot unless otherwise approved under the planned development provision. In such districts, if there is a dwelling unit on a lot, the structure in which the dwelling unit is located shall be considered the principal structure.
C. Accessory structures on lots. In Residential and Rural Lands Districts, the following limitations apply:
(1) There shall be no more than three detached accessory structures on a lot;
(2) The combined area of all accessory structures on a lot shall not exceed the lesser of 3,000 square feet or 50% of the area remaining after excluding:
(a) Required setbacks; and
(b) The area occupied by the principal structure (see illustration).
[Image]
(3) These limitations do not apply to structures used for agricultural purposes in districts where agriculture is a permitted use.
D. Demolition, burning or abandonment of structures. Not later than six months after a permanent or temporary building or structure has been damaged, destroyed, demolished or abandoned, all scrap, damaged or unsafe materials shall be removed from the site. Any excavation thus remaining shall be covered over or filled to the normal grade by the owner. An extension of time may be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment as a conditional use.
§ 260-24 Access and parking.
A. Required access to public roads or public waters. No land development may be permitted on lots which do not either have frontage on a public road or public waters or, with the approval of the Planning Commission, access to such a road or waters by a permanent easement or right-of-way of record at least 50 feet wide. The Planning Commission may approve a reduction in width to a minimum of 20 feet, provided the drive serves four or fewer dwelling units and adequate safe access will exist with such reduced width.
B. Location of curb cuts in relation to intersections. Except for driveways accessing one- and two-family dwellings, all curb cuts shall be located at least 100 feet from any intersecting public right-of-way on the same side of the street.
C. Off-street parking. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the specifications of this section whenever any new use is established or existing use enlarged.
(1) Location. Whenever possible, off-street parking shall be on the same lot as the use itself. If parking is to be provided on public or private land off-site, the following provisions apply:
(a) Safety. The passage between the parking lot and the building for which parking is being provided shall be safe and well lighted.
(b) Maximum distance to off-site parking. The distance between the pedestrian entrance to the parking lot and the nearest public entrance to the building shall be no more than 1,000 feet, except in the Downtown White River Junction Parking District.
(c) Downtown White River Junction Parking District. This area (as delineated on the Downtown White River Junction Parking District Map) is recognized as a high-density residential, retail and service center in the Town, with a walkable scale and access to public transit, on-street parking and municipal parking lots. Development projects within this district may use off-site parking anywhere within the district regardless of distance, providing it meets the requirements of Subsection C(1).
(d) Lease or easement required. If the parking is to be provided on private land owned by someone other than the applicant, the applicant shall submit evidence that a lease or easement for a period equal to the proposed use has been obtained and that it has been recorded in the Town Land Records.
(e) Use of municipal parking. If an applicant proposes that some or all of the parking requirement is to be met through the use of a municipal lot, the applicant may submit evidence that such use can be accommodated by existing facilities or propose a cost-sharing plan with a contribution to assist in the construction of additional facilities.
(2) Size of parking spaces. With the exception of parallel parking, each space shall be configured so it can contain a rectangle 18 feet long and nine feet wide, exclusive of access drives or aisles. Parking spaces may be installed at an angle as long as the usable area of each space meets this requirement. Parallel parking space shall be a minimum of 22 feet long by eight feet wide, exclusive of access drives or aisles.
(3) Special needs parking. Parking for the handicapped shall be provided in accordance with provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act as amended at the time of application for site plan review.
(4) Minimum width of access drives and aisles.
(a) The following dimensional requirements shall apply unless varied by the Planning Commission based on evidence supplied by a qualified transportation professional, specializing in the field of traffic analysis:
[1] Access drive at its intersection with a public street: 15 feet for one-way traffic, 26 feet for two-way traffic, and 12 feet per lane for three or more lanes. A minimum curb return radius of 20 feet shall be provided.
[2] Internal drive which does not directly access any parking spaces: 12 feet for one-way traffic and 24 feet for two-way traffic.
[3] Width of an aisle between parking spaces:
Type of Parking
Width of Aisle

(b) Large vehicle accommodation. Lots to be used by larger vehicles shall meet dimensional requirements established during site development plan review.
(c) Large parking lots. Except for automobile dealership display parking areas, parking lots with 100 or more parking spaces shall have an internal circulation road which meets the minimum design and construction standards of a public road. Only parallel parking shall be permitted on an internal circulation road.
(5) Drive-in/Drive-through businesses. Drive-in food service, restaurants and banks with drive-in teller windows, and other drive-in businesses shall have a stacking lane for each window or remote customer service point able to accommodate a minimum of three vehicles to keep the line of waiting vehicles from extending into the public right-of-way or interfering with on-site parking and access.
(6) Stacked parking. Each parking space shall have access to a driveway or street. However, the Planning Commission may permit stacked parking (one vehicle behind another) in order to meet the minimum parking requirements where unique circumstances exist on a lot if the users will be residents of a single dwelling unit, accessory apartment or duplex unit, or if there is a dedicated employee-only parking, signed as such.
(7) Safety, access and circulation.
(a) Traffic flow and pedestrian safety. Parking shall be designed to provide for maximum ease in traffic flow and pedestrian safety.
(b) Egress requirements. Vehicles shall exit facing the street as close to a ninety-degree angle as possible, unless the Planning Commission finds that some other arrangement will meet the safety requirements of the site.
(c) Parking availability. No parking space shall be used for any purpose that limits its availability for parking year-round. Spaces which will be blocked by winter snow piles or be unsafe due to snowfall from adjacent roofs may not be considered as part of the required spaces, nor may spaces being used for emergency access, loading or deliveries, dumpsters or storage of merchandise, unregistered vehicles or other materials.
(d) Surface materials and drainage. Surfacing materials and drainage shall be adequate to withstand the traffic expected and ensure a dry surface during periods of expected use. When possible, water shall be retained on site and allowed to filter into the ground.
(e) Parking lot maintenance. Parking areas shall be adequately drained, lighted, and kept free of snow and ice.
(f) Street and sidewalk improvements. The Planning Commission may require, as a condition of granting approval to a site plan, such improvements to the street network or public sidewalks as may be required to provide safe and adequate access to the parking area.
(8) Visual considerations.
(a) Parking in the front setback.
[1] Single-family, accessory apartments and two-family units. Parking may occupy up to 50% of the front lot line of the parcel without the approval of the Planning Commission. For corner lots, the front lot line shall be defined as the side with access to a public or private road.
[2] Other uses. Parking areas shall be located behind the front building line of a structure unless approved by the Planning Commission.
(b) Landscaping. The site shall be designed and landscaped to minimize negative visual impacts and maximize safety. Plantings may be required for this purpose, both within the lot and between it and any public road or adjacent property. Plants shall not be invasive to Vermont, shall be selected for their ability to survive under special conditions found in a parking lot, and shall be protected from damage by vehicles and maintenance equipment, including snow removal and storage.
(c) Defining parking area. The outside edges of the parking lot shall be delineated by curbing, fencing, or other means that will confine vehicles to the areas intended for parking.
(d) Parking on lawns. Parking shall not be allowed on lawns unless it is demonstrated that the use of such areas will be so infrequent that the grass will not be damaged.
(e) Parking buffers. Where any nonresidential or mixed-use district abuts a residential district, the parking area shall be located at least 10 feet from the property line abutting the residential district, and the spaces shall be landscaped.
(9) Number of parking spaces required.
(a) Unless the number is varied by the Planning Commission in accordance with Subsections C(9)(b) through (f), parking spaces shall be provided as follows:

(b) Rounding rule. The number of required spaces shall be calculated to the nearest 0.1; totals shall be rounded to the nearest whole number when all items have been added.
(c) Other uses. For uses not listed above, the Planning Commission shall decide the number of required parking spaces.
(d) Excess parking. Parking shall not be constructed for any building or use in excess of the number specified above without the approval of the Planning Commission as specified in Subsection C(9)(e).
(e) Modification of parking requirements.
[1] If, in site plan approval proceedings or at any time in the future after a duly warned hearing, the Planning Commission determines that unique usage or special conditions exist which warrant increasing or reducing the need for parking, it may require the provision of off-street parking spaces up to 50% more or less than the requirements in Subsection C(9)(a) above. In the Central Business District, the parking may be reduced beyond 50%. When approving an increase or reduction in any zoning district, the Planning Commission shall consider the following:
[a] Is the site located on or within 1,000 feet of a transit route?
[b] Are there shared parking facilities with abutting businesses which are sufficient to meet parking demand?
[c] For mixed-use projects, do the proposed uses have staggered business hours with minimal overlap?
[d] Does the type of business proposed generate substantial pedestrian traffic and are adequate pedestrian facilities present?
[e] Does an employer-sponsored "transit pass" program, or vanpool, carpool or rideshare program exist or can one be established (as a condition of the approval) to substantially reduce the need for on-site parking?
[f] Is safe and adequate on-street parking available?
[g] Is parking in municipal parking lots available?
[h] Does the Institute of Traffic Engineers, American Planning Association or other professional source show parking demand requirements for the proposed use(s) that are different than the standards specified in these regulations?
[i] Is there other information that justifies a change in the parking requirements?
[2] Any reduction in required parking shall apply to the uses specified by the Planning Commission at the time of application only. In so reducing the required number of spaces, the Planning Commission shall:
[a] Specify some or all of the parking spaces as permanently reduced or as deferred parking [see Subsection C(10) following].
[b] Specify that no parking space designated for shared parking under the provisions of this subsection shall be assigned or reserved for a particular party or use unless expressly authorized by the Planning Commission.
[c] Document precisely the calculation procedure used in determining the required number of spaces. In no case shall the parking be reduced below 100% of the largest parking generator as determined under Subsection C(9)(a) above.
(f) Traffic study. The Commission may require an applicant for site plan approval to submit a traffic study, at the applicant's expense, by a qualified transportation professional, specializing in the field of traffic analysis, of estimates of daily and peak-hour traffic generation.
(10) Deferred construction of parking spaces.
(a) When the Planning Commission approves a reduction in parking as provided for in Subsection C(9)(e) above, it may defer the construction of the required parking spaces until such time as it determines, after a hearing, that the spaces are needed.
(b) Space for deferred parking shall be labeled "Future Parking" on the site plan and landscaped until needed.
(c) The Planning Commission may require a letter of credit or other financial security instrument adequate to ensure that parking spaces will be constructed when they are needed.
D. Off-street loading.
(1) For every building erected, altered or extended for the purpose of business, trade or industry, there shall be off-street space for loading and unloading vehicles as follows:
(a) Wholesale, warehouse, freight and trucking terminals: one for every 7,500 square feet of floor area;
(b) All other: one for every 10,000 square feet of floor area.
(2) Off-street loading spaces shall be scaled to the size of delivery vehicles expected and configured to maximize convenience for pick-up and delivery of bulk items. They shall be located in such a way as to minimize interactions with private vehicles and pedestrians and maximize safety in entering the public way. Required off-street loading space is not to be included as off-street parking space.
(3) When an existing use is changed or altered, the requirements of Subsection D(1) may be reduced by the Planning Commission if it finds there will be no traffic or safety hazard created.
§ 260-25 Protection of surface waters.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect water quality, reduce property loss, and preserve wildlife habitat by maintaining a riparian buffer (an undisturbed vegetated buffer) along surface waters. Riparian buffers provide many valuable functions, including filtering pollution and sediment from surface runoff, stabilizing streambanks to reduce erosion, regulating water temperatures vital for fish, and controlling floodwaters by limiting runoff and slowing water velocity.
B. Affected areas. A riparian buffer shall be maintained for a minimum of 100 feet from the top of the bank of the Connecticut, Ottauquechee and White Rivers, or for a minimum of 30 feet from the edge of a stream or any other surface water identified on the most recent edition of the Hartford G.I.S. Natural Resources Map. The riparian buffer also includes the area between the river and the top of the bank. No development, excavation, filling, clearing or grading shall occur within the buffer without conditional use approval from the Zoning Board of Adjustment except as specified in Subsections D and E.
C. Surface water determination. Surface water includes all rivers, streams, brooks, creeks, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs identified on the most recent edition of the Hartford G.I.S. Natural Resources Map. Surface water excludes any isolated ponds and permitted stormwater detention ponds. If the accuracy of the map is questioned, a site visit will be made to determine the specific location of the surface water, including the top of bank or edge of water.
D. Exemptions and buffer width reductions.
(1) Exemptions.
(a) Structures, lawns, mowed or cut areas, gardens, agricultural lands, golf courses, parks, athletic turf fields and trails existing before the adoption of these regulations that occur within the riparian buffer are allowed to continue to be maintained, provided that they are maintained at least once every three years.
(b) Projects that have a Riparian Buffer Management Plan with the Agency of Natural Resources or Act 250 which was approved prior to the adoption of these regulations.
(c) Emergency repairs of damage caused by flooding or other natural disasters.
(2) Buffer width reductions.
(a) On existing lots of 1.00 acre or less, the buffer width requirement is reduced by 50% without the need of a conditional use permit.
(b) For home gardens, the buffer width requirement is reduced to 25 feet without the need for a conditional use permit. Gardens no longer being used must be allowed to return to a naturally vegetated condition.
E. Allowable uses and activities. The following uses are allowed, provided that the least possible area of existing riparian vegetation is disturbed and disturbed riparian areas are replanted with a mixture
of native or noninvasive trees, shrubs, and grasses. Disturbed areas that will not be replanted for one week shall be temporarily mulched. Disturbed areas that will not be replanted within three weeks shall be temporarily seeded and mulched and stabilized by the use of other methods that may be needed to prevent erosion. Replanting must be completed within one year.
(1) Tree pruning and selective tree removal, provided that it results in minimal breaks to the tree canopy.
(2) Installation of fences and signs and incidental recreational items such as canoe racks, picnic tables, barbecue grills, trash receptacles and benches or similar minor items, provided that they are installed on a pervious surface.
(3) Removal of nonnative nuisance species as defined as noxious weeds by the Vermont Department of Agriculture.
(4) Archaeological investigations coordinated with the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources and the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation.
(5) Removal of trees and shrubs to enhance views, provided the frontage area does not exceed a total of 25 linear feet along the shoreline; the stumps and root systems of removed vegetation remain intact in the ground wherever possible; and the area is replanted with native or noninvasive shrubs and grasses. This twenty-five-foot allowance includes any existing clearings. Additional surface water protection measures are required as stated in Subsection F(1)(b) and Acceptable Management Practices for Maintaining Water Quality on Logging Jobs in Vermont (Section 1, #8; surface water and stream crossing protective strips; and Section 14, protective strips).

(a) Fall zones for existing and new ground-mounted facilities. To ensure public safety, the minimum distance of any ground-mounted wireless service facility to any property line, habitable dwelling, business, right-of-way, institutional or public building shall be no less than the height of the facility, including antennas or vertical appurtenances. This setback shall be referred to as a "fall zone." The fall zone may cross property lines, so long as the applicant secures a fall zone easement from the affected property owner(s). The area of the easement shall be shown on all applicable plans submitted to the Town, and the terms of the easement shall be provided as part of the site development plan review.
(b) Fall zones for non-ground-mounted facilities. In the event that an existing structure such as a building, barn silo, church steeple, or utility pole is proposed as a mounting for a wireless communication facility, a fall zone setback shall not be required.
(3) Height limitations. (Zoning Board of Adjustment).

In order to protect public safety and to preserve the scenic character and appearance of the area, the height limit for a wireless communication facility, antennas and facility-related fixtures in all districts shall not exceed 20 feet above the average height of the tree line within 150 feet of the base of the facility. Notwithstanding the above, an additional height not to exceed 20 feet may be approved upon a finding by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, as part of the conditional use review, that the additional height is necessary in order to provide adequate coverage, or to accomplish collocation as outlined in Subsection E(11), and that the additional height will not have an adverse visual impact on the scenic character or appearance of the area as per Subsection E(14).
(b) Height increase for existing structures and buildings. In the event that an existing structure (other than a wireless communication tower) is proposed as a mount for a wireless communication facility, the height of the structure shall not be increased by more than 15 feet above the highest point of a flat or mansard roof or 15 feet above the midpoint of other roofs unless the facility is completely camouflaged; for example, a facility within a flagpole, steeple or chimney. The increase in the height of the structure shall be in scale and proportionality to the structure as originally configured. A provider may locate a wireless communication facility on a building that is legally nonconforming with respect to height, provided that the provisions of this section are met.
(4) Camouflaging facilities (Zoning Board of Adjustment). New ground-mounted wireless communication facilities shall not be located within open areas or on or near the top of a ridge. To
the greatest extent feasible, all wireless communication facilities shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of existing vegetation, landscaping and screening, the use of compatible materials and colors, or other camouflaging techniques.
(a) Camouflage for ground-mounted facilities/towers. A buffer of dense tree growth that extends continuously for a minimum distance of 150 feet from the mount shall surround new ground-mounted wireless communication facilities. Such buffer shall screen views of the facility in all directions. The trees must be existing on the subject property, planted on site, or within a landscape easement on an adjoining site. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to decrease, relocate, or alter the required buffer based on site conditions and add other conditions to the permit regarding screening and landscaping. The vegetated buffer area shall be protected by a landscape easement or be within the area of the provider's lease. The easement or lease shall specify that the trees within the buffer shall be maintained and shall not be removed or trimmed, unless the trees are dead or dying and present a hazard to persons or property, or approval is granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
(b) Camouflage for facilities on existing buildings or structures: roof mounts. When a wireless communication facility extends above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, every effort shall be made to conceal or camouflage the facility within or behind existing or new architectural features to limit its visibility from public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be stepped back from the front facade in order to limit their impact on the building's silhouette.
(c) Camouflage for facilities on existing buildings or structures: side mounts. Wireless communication facilities that are side-mounted shall be camouflaged.
(d) Camouflaging for equipment shelters. Equipment shelters shall be camouflaged behind an effective year-round landscape buffer at the time of planting, equal to or greater than the height of the proposed building, and/or wooden fence as determined by the Planning Commission as part of site development plan review. If mounted on a rooftop, the equipment shelter shall be concealed or camouflaged so that the shelter either is not visible at grade or appears to be part of the original structure.
(5) Lighting (Planning Commission).
(a) Wireless communication facility lighting. Wireless communication facilities shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not display lights unless such lighting is specifically required by the FAA or other federal or state authority for a particular wireless communication facility because of its height. If any lighting is required solely because of the height of the facility, the applicant must demonstrate that it has or will request the least visually obtrusive marking and/or lighting scheme in the FAA applications. Additionally, the Planning Commission, as part of site development plan review, may review the plan to determine if the lighting requirement can be eliminated by a reduced height or a change in location of the facility.
(b) Ground lighting. Emergency, safety or security ground lighting may be utilized when there are people at the site. All ground lighting shall be directed downward towards the facility, shielded and away from neighboring properties.
(6) Bulk, height, and glare (Zoning Board of Adjustment). All wireless communication facilities shall be designed in such a manner as to minimize the visual impact of height, mass, and guy wire supports for the intended use. Materials utilized for the exterior of any structure shall be of a type, style, and location so as to minimize glare and not result in an adverse visual impact on any historic or scenic view, public vantage point or from abutting properties.
(7) Finish (Zoning Board of Adjustment). New wireless communication facilities shall have a galvanized finish unless otherwise required. The Zoning Board of Adjustment, as part of conditional use review, may require the wireless communication facility to be painted or otherwise camouflaged
to minimize the adverse visual impact.
(8) Fencing (Planning Commission). The area around the wireless communication facility and communications equipment shall be completely fenced and gated for security to a height of eight feet. Fencing shall be chosen so as to minimize visual impact and be consistent with its intended safety purpose.
(9) Signs (Planning Commission). A sign no greater than six square feet stating the name of the facility's owner and a twenty-four-hour emergency telephone number shall be posted adjacent to the entry gate. In addition, "No Trespassing" or other warning signs and the federal wireless communication facility registration plate, where applicable, may be posted on the fence or as required to meet federal requirements. No commercial signs or lettering shall be placed on the tower or facility. This provision supersedes the Hartford Sign Ordinance.
(10) Noise (Planning Commission). The Planning Commission may impose conditions to minimize the effect of noise from the operation of machinery or equipment upon adjacent properties and to ensure the standards of § 260-31A.
(11) Collocation (Zoning Board of Adjustment).
(a) New wireless communication facilities shall be designed structurally, electrically and in all respects to accommodate both the applicant's antenna, additional antennas, and the rearrangement of antennas when the overall permitted height allows. The owner of an approved facility shall allow other providers to collocate on the facility subject to reasonable terms and conditions. Notwithstanding, there shall be no affirmative obligation on the owner to increase the height or width of the facility in order to accommodate the equipment or facilities of another user.
(b) The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Zoning Board of Adjustment that the new wireless communication facility cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved facility or structure due to one of the following reasons:
[1] Structural or spatial capacity. The proposed antennas and equipment would exceed the structural or spatial capacity of the existing or approved facility, as documented by a structural engineer licensed to practice in the State of Vermont. Additionally, the existing or approved wireless communication facility cannot be reinforced, modified or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment, at a reasonable cost, to provide coverage and capacity comparable to that of the proposed facility.
[2] Radio frequency interference. The proposed antennas and equipment, alone or together with existing facilities, equipment or antennas, would create radio frequency interference (RFI) in violation of federal standards or requirements as documented by a qualified radio frequency engineer.
[3] Radio frequency radiation. The proposed antennas and equipment, alone or together with existing facilities, equipment or antennas, would create radio frequency radiation (RFR) in violation of federal standards or requirements without unreasonable modification or mitigation measures as documented by a qualified radio frequency engineer.
[4] Existing facilities. Existing wireless communication facilities cannot accommodate, or be reasonably modified to accommodate, the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably or are too far from the area of needed coverage to function reasonably as documented by a qualified radio frequency engineer.
[5] Aesthetics. Aesthetic reasons make it unreasonable to locate the planned equipment upon an existing or approved wireless communication facility.
[6] Coverage. There are no existing or approved wireless communication facilities in the area in which coverage is sought.
[7] Other. Other specific unforeseen reasons make it unreasonable to locate the planned equipment upon an existing or approved wireless communication facility.
(12) Access roads (Planning Commission). If available, existing entrances and driveways shall be utilized, unless the applicant can demonstrate that a new entrance and driveway will result in less visual and environmental impact. To the extent practicable, new access roads shall follow the contour of the land and be located within existing forest or forest fringe areas and not in open fields.
(13) Aboveground utilities (Zoning Board of Adjustment). Utility or service lines shall be designed and located so as to minimize or prevent disruption to the scenic character of the area.
(14) Determination of visual impact (Zoning Board of Adjustment). Upon review of the applicant's visual analysis, supporting materials, testimony from the parties, and inspections from the designated vantage points, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall determine that the proposed facility does not have an adverse visual impact on the scenic or natural beauty of the land proposed to be developed (including scenic areas as identified in the Hartford Master Plan). The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall consider, among other things, the following:
(a) The amount of time and time of year during which the proposed facility will be viewed by the traveling public on a public highway, public trail, or public water body;
(b) The frequency of the view of the proposed facility by the traveling public;
(c) The degree to which the view of the proposed facility is screened by existing vegetation, the topography of the land, and existing structures;
(d) Background features in the line of sight to the proposed facility that obscure the facility or make it more conspicuous from all angles of view;
(e) The distance of the wireless communication facility from key vantage points and the proportion of the facility which will be visible above the skyline or treeline;
(f) The number of members of the traveling public or residents of Hartford and neighboring towns who will be affected by the alteration of the scenic character of the area;
(g) The sensitivity or unique value of the particular view affected by the proposed facility; and
(h) Significant disruption of a view that provides context to an historic or scenic resource, including the Appalachian Trail.
(15) Noncomplying wireless communication facility (Zoning Board of Adjustment). Any changes to a noncomplying wireless communication facility must be in conformity with these regulations unless a variance from these regulations is obtained from the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
F. Conditions. The Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have the authority to impose conditions consistent with the purpose of § 260-16B, this section and § 260-45B in approving a proposed plan for the development of a wireless communication facility. It shall be the obligation of the permittees and subsequent assigns to remain in compliance with all conditions.

In lieu of the completion of the required public improvements, the Commission may require for the benefit of the municipality a performance bond or other security issued either by a bonding or surety company approved by the legislative body or by the owner with security acceptable to the legislative body in an amount sufficient to cover the full cost of those new streets and required improvements on or in those streets or highways and their maintenance for a period of two years after completion as is estimated by the Town. This bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public, the completion of any improvements that may be required within the period fixed in the subdivision bylaws for that completion and for the maintenance of those improvements for a period of two years after completion. Any costs incurred by the Town related to the performance bond or other securities are the responsibility of the applicant and/or property owner.
(2) The performance bond required by this subsection shall run for a term to be fixed by the Commission, but in no case for a longer term than three years. However, with the consent of the owner, the term of that bond may be extended for an additional period not to exceed three years. If any required improvements have not been installed or maintained as provided within the term of the performance bond, the bond shall be forfeited to the municipality and upon receipt of the proceeds of the bond, the Town shall install or maintain such improvements as are covered by the performance bond.
§ 260-46 Design review districts.
As provided for in Section 4414(1)(E) of the Act, provision is hereby made for establishment of design review districts for any area containing structures of historical, architectural or cultural merit, as well as areas with striking vistas, agricultural settlement patterns or other significant landscape features. Within this designated district, all structures that are erected, reconstructed, altered, restored, moved, or demolished, or land development that is commenced must be in compliance with the design review sections detailed in these regulations. A Design Review Committee (DRC) may be appointed by the Selectboard in accordance with Section 4433 of the Act to advise the Planning Commission.
A. Downtown White River Junction Design Review District.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this district is to recognize that White River Junction's natural beauty and visual and historic character represent an important asset to the Town, and contribute substantially to White River Junction's economic base. In order to protect and enhance these attributes, the district is
established to ensure that development considers the existing architecture, site layout, streetscape design, and sign placement and design. This design review is not intended to require property owners to solely rehabilitate or replicate. Although reuse of existing buildings is encouraged wherever possible, new construction is appropriate when designed with sensitivity to the historic character and design features in the district. Specific recommendations for development and redevelopment of the district are made in the White River Junction Design Plan (2001) and White River Junction Design Guidelines (2001), which are incorporated into the Zoning Regulations by reference.
(2) Goals. The design goals of the Downtown White River Junction Design Review District are as follows:
(a) To maintain a vibrant downtown, economically, functionally and culturally.
(b) To preserve and conserve the historic qualities of the downtown and retain a sense of place.
(c) To ensure architectural and site enhancements and/or new development projects preserve and/or enhance the historic qualities of downtown.
(d) To acknowledge and preserve the integrity of the built form of the downtown, including landmarks, buildings and streetscape patterns.
(e) To support public and private sector design and development that is compatible with the qualities of the downtown streetscape, townscape and historic architecture.
(f) To educate the public on the value of preserving and enhancing the downtown and the historic district.
(g) To create suitable places for pedestrians.
(h) To accommodate parking with the least impact and encourage shared parking where appropriate.
(3) District boundaries. The Downtown White River Junction Design Review District shall consist of all lands designated on the White River Junction Design Review District Boundary Map referenced in § 260-12 of these Zoning Regulations.
(4) Uses. All uses that are currently permitted or conditionally permitted in the underlying zoning district remain the same. All dimensional requirements from the underlying zoning district, unless otherwise stated in the White River Junction Design Guidelines, remain the same.
(5) Design review approval. Except as hereafter provided, no person shall do or cause to be done any of the following acts with respect to any building located within the Downtown White River Junction Design Review District without first obtaining design review approval from the DRC, and design review approval from the Planning Commission. If, after review by the DRC, the Committee determines that the changes are minor and have no adverse effect related to the goals identified in Subsection A(2), the DRC may recommend to the Planning Commission that the proposed change be approved administratively in accordance with Subsection A(6).
(a) New construction, including, but not limited to, a building, wall, fence, or other streetscape or site development activities on private and public land, including in the right-of-way.
(b) Addition, alteration or restoration of the exterior of a building, including windows, doorways, porches, roofing, siding and other materials when different from those existing.
(c) Alteration of the roof line of a building, excluding chimney alterations.
(d) Moving of a building from its present location to another.
(e) The demolition of a building [see Subsection A(12)].
(6) Administrative design review approval.
(a) If, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator and the Planning Commission Chairperson with input from the DRC Chairperson, the following items are determined to be minor and have no adverse effect related to the goals identified in Subsection A(2), administrative design review approval may be granted. Such improvements may include:
[1] Landscaping upgrades consistent with the guidelines;
[2] Routine maintenance or repair of any structure, as long as the maintenance or repair does not result in any change of design, type of material, or appearance of the structure or its appurtenances;
[3] Simple utility adjustments or upgrades, such as replacement of a transformer, new power poles or satellite dish;
[4] Installation of permanent signs; or
[5] Installation of exterior lighting.
(b) Otherwise, design review approval by the Planning Commission is required.
(7) Exempt development. The following activities are exempt from design review approval requirements:
(a) Routine site maintenance and repair;
(b) A change in use or occupancy;
(c) Exterior changes that cannot be seen from any public area;
(d) Interior changes;
(e) The refacing of an existing sign; or
(f) Painting (using the same color or changing to a different color).
(8) Review procedures. For application deadlines, the applicant shall consult the Hartford Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment adopted schedule. Once an application for design review approval is received by the Administrative Officer and determined to be complete, the following procedures shall be followed:
(a) The DRC shall meet to review the application within 10 days of the application submittal deadline. Said meeting may be continued upon mutual consent by the DRC and applicant.
(b) The DRC shall forward a written recommendation of the application to the Planning Commission prior to the next scheduled Planning Commission public hearing.
(c) The Planning Commission shall review the DRC recommendation on the proposal at a public hearing and render a decision on the application within 45 days after the adjournment of the public hearing.
(9) Application requirements. In addition to the submittal requirements of § 260-45, any application for construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any building in the Downtown White River Junction Design Review District shall include the following:
(a) Narrative describing the project;
(b) Description of materials to be used on the exterior of the building;
(c) Proposed architectural elevations (prepared by an architect registered in the State of Vermont) showing door and window types, shutters and other exterior details;
(d) Color photographs of the subject building;
(e) Color photographs of existing buildings on adjacent or nearby properties to illustrate the existing streetscape;
(f) Site plan; and
(g) Any additional information which may be requested by the DRC or the Planning Commission as necessary for a clear understanding of the proposal, including scale models or other three-dimensional analyses.
(10) Diversity of design. These regulations recognize the value of diversity in design solutions based on a wide variety of architectural styles and design philosophies, without imposing a particular aesthetic value or prohibiting the introduction of new forms into the built environment, provided these are consistent with the intent of this district.
(11) Design criteria. In making a determination on an application, the Design Review Committee and Planning Commission shall give consideration to the White River Junction Design Plan and White River Junction Design Guidelines and the following criteria:
(a) The way in which the project preserves and/or enhances the integrity of the historic architecture of the downtown and the specific buildings.
(b) The way in which the project uses historically appropriate or compatible materials where possible in rehabilitation and new construction projects.
(c) The way in which the project respects existing setbacks, scale and massing when developing a new building or addition.
(d) The way in which the project employs appropriate lighting patterns and levels that reflect use, safety and security.
(e) The way in which the project implements streetscape elements on a building-by-building basis.
(f) The way in which the project preserves the landscape, including existing terrain, trees and vegetation to the extent feasible.
(g) The way in which the project promotes accessibility and rear access from parking areas to commercial buildings.
(h) The way in which the project provides efficient and effective vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
(i) The way in which the details being proposed for the building, including window, door, and trim, are compatible with the existing and adjacent buildings' historic and design qualities.
(12) Demolition of historic buildings within the design review district.
(a) All requests for the demolition of a building listed as a contributing property on the National Register of Historic Places within the Downtown White River Junction Design Review District shall
be submitted to the Administrative Officer.
[1] The DRC shall meet to review the request within 10 days of the application submittal deadline. Said meeting may be continued upon mutual consent by the DRC and applicant.
[2] The DRC shall forward a written recommendation of the application to the Planning Commission prior to the next scheduled Planning Commission public hearing.
[3] The Planning Commission shall review the DRC recommendation on the proposal at a public hearing and render a decision on the application within 45 days after the adjournment of the public hearing.
(b) The applicant shall provide evidence at the time of the demolition request that one of the following conditions has been met:
[1] Retention of the building is not feasible because it is structurally unsound as determined by a structural engineer licensed in the State of Vermont; or
[2] Rehabilitation of the building, or portion thereof, would cause undue financial hardship. The applicant must provide clear and convincing evidence that any reasonable return cannot be obtained from the building without approval of the request for demolition.
(c) If the request for demolition is approved by the Planning Commission, the applicant shall provide an opportunity to the Historic Preservation Commission to conduct photo documentation of the interior of the building no less than 15 days prior to the scheduled demolition.
(d) If a building has been damaged by flood, fire, wind or other act of nature in excess of 70% of its fair market value prior to damage as determined by a State of Vermont certified or licensed real estate appraiser, permission for demolition may be granted by the Administrative Officer without prior review by the DRC or the Planning Commission.
§ 260-47 Planned development.
In accordance with Section 4417 of the Act, the Planning Commission may vary certain regulations in order to encourage new communities, innovation in design and layout, more efficient use of land and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of the open land in Town. Approval for a planned development may be granted by the Planning Commission with the approval of a subdivision plat. Approval of a planned development includes approval of a major subdivision.
A. Proposals for planned development shall be submitted to the Planning Commission. The material accompanying the proposal shall contain the following:
(1) The required site plan shall show all buildings, parking areas and landscaping at a scale sufficient to permit the study of all elements of the plan. All utilities shall also be shown and described. Typical elevations and floor plans of all buildings may also be required. In addition, the site plans shall show the adjacent building outlines and other outstanding features within 200 feet. Amendments to approved site plans which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator and Planning Commission Chairperson, are minor and have no adverse effect in terms of the objectives stated in Subsection A(2) may be approved administratively upon filing of the appropriate applications.
(2) A narrative master plan, the Official Development Plan, which shall state the objective, uses (permitted and/or conditional as appropriate), area and dimension standards, phasing, and any other land use standards appropriate to the planned development and necessary to meet the objectives and intent of the Hartford Master Plan, Zoning Regulations, and the planned development.
B. The purpose (conditions) of a planned development shall be to encourage a development which will result in:
(1) A choice in the types of environment and living units (where applicable) available to the public, and quality in land uses so that development will be a permanent and long-term asset to the Town.
(2) Open space and recreation areas if dwelling units are a part of the development.
(3) A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural topography and geologic features and prevents soil erosion.
(4) An efficient use of land resulting in small networks of utilities and streets.
(5) An environment in harmony with surrounding development.
(6) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of other sections of these regulations.
C. Density may vary within the development. The Planning Commission may permit an additional number of dwelling units in an area designated for residential use so long as the total number of such dwelling units shall not exceed 125% of the permitted number of units based on a calculation in conformance with strict application of the zone district standards for area per family contained in the table of Article II for the district in which the land is situated. This density bonus shall never be automatic, but shall be based on a review by the Planning Commission that concludes that the developer's plan includes design, innovative features, or facilities that satisfy the purposes listed in Subsection B above.
D. The predominant use or impact of the land use shall not differ substantially from the uses permitted in the district in which the plan is located. In a planned development, dwelling units may be multifamily. In a planned development in a residential district, commercial educational and public facilities may be allowed which are designed to serve the development and the area around the development.
E. Minimum area and dimension requirements may be waived; however, these will be evaluated by the Planning Commission on their individual merit. Any changes which are granted shall be noted on the plat.
F. A planned development shall comply with the following standards:
(1) Off-lot water and sewer may be required for over six dwelling units.
(2) At least 50% of the development shall be in open space for public and/or common usage. The regulations for control and maintenance of this open space shall be approved by the Planning Commission. This may be waived by the Planning Commission for commercial and industrial planned developments, providing adequate screening and landscaping are provided.
(3) The municipality may, at any time, accept the dedication of land or any interest in land for public use and maintenance. The Planning Commission may require that the applicant or landowner provide for and establish an organization or trust for the ownership and maintenance of any common facilities or open space, and that this organization or trust shall not be dissolved or revoked nor shall it dispose of any common open space, by sale or otherwise, except to an organization or trust conceived and established to own and maintain the common open space, without first offering to dedicate the same to the municipality or other governmental agency to maintain those common facilities or that open space.
G. The Planning Commission may prescribe, from time to time, rules and regulations to supplement the standards and conditions set forth in these Zoning Regulations for planned developments, provided the rules and regulations are not inconsistent with the Zoning Regulations. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing after public notice as required by Section 4464 of the Act
prior to the establishment of any supplementary rules and regulations for planned developments.
§ 260-48 Limitations on review authority.
The following uses may be regulated only with respect to location, size, height, building bulk, yards, courts, setbacks, density of buildings, off-street parking, loading facilities, traffic, noise, lighting, landscaping, and screening requirements and only to the extent that regulations do not have the effect of interfering with the intended functional use:
A. State- or community-owned and -operated institutions and facilities.
B. Public and private schools and other educational institutions certified by the State Department of Education.
C. Churches and other places of worship, convents, and parish houses.
D. Public and private hospitals.
E. Regional solid waste management facilities certified under 10 V.S.A. Chapter 159.
F. Hazardous waste management facilities for which a notice of intent to construct has been received under 10 V.S.A. § 6606a.
§ 260-49 Variances.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances as required by § 4469(a) of 24 V.S.A. Chapter 117. In granting a variance, the Board may impose conditions it deems necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the purposes of these regulations and the municipal plan currently in effect. The Board may grant a variance and render a decision in favor of the appellant only if all of the following facts are found, and the findings are specified in its written decision:
A. There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to these conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of these regulations in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
B. Because of these physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of these regulations and that the authorization of a variance is necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
C. The unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
D. The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, or be detrimental to the public welfare; and
E. The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from these regulations and from the plan.
§ 260-50 Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment review process.
The annual list of application deadlines and public hearings for the Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be available in December of each year. The schedule may be amended by the Planning Commission or Zoning Board of Adjustment as necessary. Regular meetings may be cancelled at any time by the Chair of the respective Commission/Board. To the extent possible, applications requiring review by the Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be scheduled to be heard during the same application cycle. The Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall adopt procedures for submission and review of said applications. The Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment must issue a written decision within 45 days of the closing of the public hearing. Failure to issue a decision within this period shall be deemed approval and shall be effective on the 46th day.
§ 260-51 Independent technical review.
The Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Adjustment/Administrative Officer may obtain an independent technical review of an application at the applicant's expense in accordance with adopted policies/procedures. (The Hartford Selectboard adopted a policy on March 28, 2006, outlining procedures and standards for assessment of technical review costs on zoning applicants.)
§ 260-52 Setback waivers.
A. Purpose. The intent of this section is to provide flexibility in setback requirements for the placement of primary and accessory structures in all zoning districts while maintaining the character of the area.
B. Allowable waivers. One of the following conditions must exist in order for a waiver to be considered, providing that a minimum setback of five feet is maintained. Waivers do not apply to setbacks from surface waters, which must meet provisions set forth in § 260-25 of these regulations and the Hartford Flood Hazard Area Regulations. Such waivers may be granted for new and complying existing structures by the Zoning Board of Adjustment following a public hearing.
(1) When the reduction is no greater than the front or side setbacks for existing structures on adjacent lots on the same street frontage.
(2) For greater fire safety as recommended by the Hartford Fire Department.
(3) For greater preservation of open land/agricultural land or scenic vistas.
(4) For greater preservation of other natural resources, such as, but not limited to, surface waters, wetlands or steep slopes.
(5) For increased energy conservation and renewable energy structures.
(6) The waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum necessary to achieve the stated purpose of this section.
C. Application procedures. Applications shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Adjustment for review and consideration at a public hearing in accordance with Section 4414(3) of the Act and the Town's application procedures and schedule.
D. Approval criteria. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall determine that, in issuing the setback waiver, the proposed development will:
(1) Be compatible with the scale and design of structures and overall existing development pattern of the surrounding area.
(2) Not impair reasonable or appropriate use of adjoining properties.
(3) Not result in greater impacts on natural resources.
(4) Not impair sight distances on public or private roads.
E. Conditions of approval. In permitting a waiver, the Board may require certain conditions to meet the stated objectives of the zoning district, reduce or eliminate impacts, or protect the interests of the surrounding properties, neighborhood or Town as a whole. These conditions may include, but need not be limited to, the following:
(1) Limit the size of the structure;
(2) Require landscaping and screening;
(3) Reduce the encroachment into the setback;
(4) Control the location and number of vehicular access points; or
(5) Require applications to have professional site plans prepared by a surveyor, engineer or architect licensed by the State of Vermont.
Article V Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots
§ 260-53 Applicability; word usage.
The following provisions shall apply to all uses, structures, and lots lawfully existing on March 1, 1962, which do not conform to the requirements set forth in these regulations, and to all uses, structures, and lots established after March 1, 1962, that, although conforming to the Zoning Regulations at the time of their establishment, no longer conform by reason of amendments to the regulations. (The words "use" and "structure" in this article shall refer to both the principal and accessory uses and structures on a lot.)
§ 260-54 Nonconforming uses.
A. Continuation of a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use may be continued indefinitely, but may not be changed, resumed after discontinuance, or expanded except as provided below.
B. Change of a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use, providing that the new nonconforming use, in the opinion of the Zoning Board, does not increase the adverse effect on the surrounding area. Conditional use approval and site development plan approval shall also be required.
C. Resumption of a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use which has been discontinued will be governed by the following regulations:
(1) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of up to l80 days may be resumed without Zoning Board or Planning Commission approval.
(2) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of 181 days or longer shall not be resumed unless a permit for extension has been obtained from the Administrative Officer prior to the expiration of the first 180 days. The first permit for extension shall be effective for one year from the date of issue, and up to three six-month renewals may be issued so long as application for each renewal is made prior to the expiration of the prior renewal. The maximum time from date of discontinuance of the nonconforming use to expiration of all extensions shall be three years.
(3) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of between l8l days and three years may be resumed only if the permits required in Subsection C(2) have been obtained and the Zoning Board finds that the resumed nonconforming use will not adversely affect the surrounding area. Conditional use approval and site development plan approval shall also be required.
(4) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for three years or more, or for which the permits required under Subsection C(2) have been allowed to expire, shall not be resumed, nor shall it be replaced with another nonconforming use.
(5) A nonconforming use which has been changed to a conforming use shall not be resumed.
(6) The intent to resume a nonconforming use shall not confer the right to do so.
(7) A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued if substantial operation of the nonconforming use of the lot or structures on the lot has not occurred for a continuous period of time. In considering whether or not a nonconforming use has been discontinued, the Zoning Board shall make findings about some or all of the following factors:
(a) Whether physical changes have been made on the lot or to a structure or sign on the lot.
(b) Whether machinery and equipment customarily used to perform the nonconforming use have been removed from the lot.
(c) Whether there has been a change of customary business practices.
(d) Whether revenues have been received and expenses incurred during the period of discontinuance and, if so, to what extent and for what use.
(e) Whether a lease (or a sale) of the lot for a use different from the nonconforming use has occurred.
(f) Whether licenses or other permits necessary to perform the nonconforming use have been renewed and whether insurance coverage has been renewed.
(g) Whether any performance of the nonconforming use that has occurred has been merely of a token extent.
(h) Whether there has been a decrease or termination in the use of utilities, such as water, wastewater, telephone, heating fuel, solid waste disposal, and electrical usage.
(i) Whether the nonconforming use, if formerly "open to the public," has continued to be "open to the public."
(j) Whether the lot, and structures, machinery, and equipment on the lot have received normal maintenance.
(k) Whether there has been a decrease in traffic to and from the lot.
(l) Whether the personnel who perform the use have been present on the lot.
(m) Whether what may appear to be discontinuance is in fact a shutdown for repairs or renovations.
(n) Whether discontinuance is the result of an inability to locate a tenant to continue the nonconforming use in spite of a diligent search to find such a tenant.
D. Expansion of a nonconforming use. The Zoning Board may allow the expansion of any nonconforming use on a lot or within a structure on a lot up to 20% greater than its existing size at the time it became a nonconforming use, provided that such expansion does not adversely affect the surrounding area. Conditional use approval and site development plan approval shall also be required. Single- and two-family dwellings which are nonconforming uses may expand without Planning Commission or Zoning Board Approval.
§ 260-55 Noncomplying structures.
A. Continuation of a noncomplying structure. Any noncomplying structure may be continued indefinitely, but may not be expanded, or repaired or reconstructed after destruction or damage, except as provided below.
B. Expansion of a noncomplying structure.
(1) A noncomplying structure may be expanded only in conformity with the dimensional requirements
of the Zoning Regulations unless a variance or setback waiver from those dimensional requirements is obtained from the Zoning Board of Adjustment. A variance or setback waiver may be granted in accordance with § 260-49 or 260-52.
(2) Single- and two-family dwellings and their accessory structures which already exist within the setback area for a lot may be expanded without the necessity for a variance or setback waiver, providing:
(a) The expansion comes no closer to the lot line than the existing structure;
(b) The height of the addition does not exceed the maximum height normally allowed; and
(c) The length of the side of the structure extending into the setback shall not exceed 20% of the original length of the noncomplying structure. This expansion shall only be allowed once without a variance or setback waiver.
C. Repair or reconstruction of a noncomplying structure. A noncomplying structure which has been destroyed or damaged by a fire, explosion or other catastrophe may be repaired or reconstructed within the same footprint, but only if such repair or reconstruction is commenced within two years and completed within three years of such destruction or damage.
D. Normal maintenance and repair of a noncomplying structure. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the structural alteration or repair, the substantial rehabilitation or remodeling, or the normal maintenance of a noncomplying structure, provided that such action does not have the effect of increasing the degree of noncompliance.
§ 260-56 Adverse effect.
In considering whether or not a change, resumption, or expansion of a nonconforming use will adversely affect the surrounding area, the Zoning Board shall make findings about some or all of the following factors:
A. The history of use of the lot.
B. The size and location of adjoining and neighboring lots.
C. The uses made, or which have received zoning permits to be made, of adjoining lots and the impact of the proposal on those uses.
D. The location of existing and proposed structures on the lot and the relation of those structures to those on adjoining lots and to the dimensional requirements of the Zoning Regulations.
E. The objective of the zoning district in which the lot and adjoining lots are located as defined in § 260-20 of the Zoning Regulations.
F. The suitability of the proposed expanded use to the character of the neighborhood.
G. Whether an increase in business hours or a change in hours from daytime to nighttime will result and the effect of such an increase or change on adjoining uses and the neighborhood.
H. Whether the proposed use will result in an increase in noise, fumes, dust, or odors.
I. Whether greater volumes of vehicular traffic will be generated and what impact this greater volume of traffic will have on the use of adjoining lots, on the neighborhood, and on pedestrian and vehicular safety.
J. Whether there will be an increase in the number of employees.
K. Whether there will be an increase in outdoor activity or outdoor storage.
L. Whether there is adequate off-street parking as required by the Zoning Regulations.
M. Whether there will be an increase in storm drainage and lighting on adjoining lots and in the neighborhood.
N. Whether there will be screening or landscaping to lessen any adverse effects on adjoining lots and the neighborhood.
O. Whether there is an increase in the visibility of the use from adjoining lots and from public ways.
P. Whether the proposed use is providing a service to the neighborhood.
Q. Whether there is an increase in safety risk to the neighborhood.
R. Whether there is a change from seasonal to year-round use.
§ 260-57 Nonconforming lots.
In zoning districts where the minimum lot size is greater than 1/8 acre, existing small lots may be developed if they are at least 1/8 of an acre in area with a width or depth of at least 40 feet. In zoning districts where the minimum lot size is less than 1/8 acre, existing small lots may be developed upon the granting of conditional use approval.
Article VI Definitions
§ 260-58 Word usage.
The word "person" includes a firm, association, organization, partnership, trust, company or corporation as well as an individual. The present tense includes the future tense, the singular number includes the plural, and the plural number includes the singular. The word "shall" is mandatory; the word "may" is permissive. The words "used or occupied" include the words "intended, designed, or arranged to be used or occupied."
§ 260-59 Terms defined.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT
An efficiency or one-bedroom apartment, located within or appurtenant to a single-family dwelling, that is clearly subordinate to a single-family dwelling, and has facilities and provisions for independent living, including sleeping, food preparation, and sanitation, provided there is compliance with all the following:
A. The owner of the single-family dwelling occupies either the primary dwelling or accessory dwelling.
B. The property has sufficient wastewater capacity.
C. The unit does not exceed 30% of the total habitable floor area of the single-family dwelling.
D. Applicable setback, coverage, and parking requirements specified in these regulations are met.
ACCESSORY PRODUCT
A product that is incidental and subordinate to the overall service performed by the commercial activity, i.e. the sale of shampoo at a barber shop or beauty salon.
ACCESS RAMP
A structure built on the outside of a building to allow direct entry to the building by persons in wheelchairs.
ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE
A use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
ADEQUATE CAPACITY (provider's capacity for wireless telephony)
When the grade of service ("GOS") is p.05 or better for median teletraffic levels offered during the typical busy hour, as assessed by direct measurement of the facility in question. The GOS shall be determined by the use of standard Erlang B calculations. As call blocking may occur in either the land line or radio portions of a wireless network, adequate capacity for this regulation shall apply only to the capacity of the radio components. When determined prior to the installation of the personal wireless services facility in question, adequate capacity shall be determined on the basis of a 20% busy hour (20% of all offered traffic occurring within the busiest hour of the day), with total daily traffic based on aggregate estimates of the expected traffic in the coverage area.
ADEQUATE COVERAGE
A provider's coverage for wireless telephony is "adequate" within that area surrounding a base station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmitted signal is such that most of the time transceivers properly installed and operated will be able to communicate with the base station without objectionable noise (or excessive-bit-error-rate for digital) and without calls being dropped. In the case of cellular communications in a rural environment, this would be a signal strength of at least -90 dBm. It is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage as long as the signal regains its strength further away from the base station. The outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage, however, is that location past which the signal does not regain.
ADULT CABARET
An adult-oriented business establishment that regularly features dancing or other live entertainment which emphasizes the exhibition of specified sexual activities and/or specified anatomical areas for the observation of patrons (see "adult oriented business," "specified anatomical areas," "specified sexual activities").
ADULT MEDIA
Magazines, books, videotapes, movies, slides, cd-roms, or other devices used to record computer images, or other media that are distinguished or characterized by the emphasis on matter depicting, describing or relating to specified anatomical areas and/or specified sexual activities.
ADULT-ORIENTED BUSINESS
An establishment catering to patrons 18 years of age or older, which devotes a substantial portion of its business activity, as determined under § 260-40B, to sexually oriented materials or entertainment (see "adult cabaret," "adult retail," "adult theater").
ADULT RETAIL
An adult-oriented business establishment that devotes a substantial portion of its business, as defined herein, to the sale and/or rental of adult media, and/or sexually oriented toys and novelties, in accordance with the requirements of these regulations (see "adult media," "adult-oriented business").
ADULT THEATER
An adult-oriented business establishment in an enclosed building which presents motion pictures,
films, videotapes, cable television, or any other such visual media, of which a substantial portion of the total presentation time is devoted to the showing of visual, sexually oriented adult media depicting, describing or relating to specified anatomical areas and/or specified sexual activities for observation by patrons (see "adult media," "adult-oriented business," "specified anatomical areas," "specified sexual activities").
AFFILIATED OWNERSHIP

In the event that an employee receives a gift or gratuity from any source, by virtue of the fact that he/she is a Town employee, they shall immediately inform his/her department head. Failure to report such gifts or gratuities may present grounds for suspension or dismissal. The department head shall immediately inform the Town Manager of all gifts and/or gratuities received by the Department whether individually or collectively. The Town Manager may allow the acceptance of such gifts and/or gratuities by the individual or department.
§ 350-30 Safe work.
A. The Selectboard and management of the Town of Hartford recognizes its employees as one of its most important and valued assets. As such, the Town of Hartford is committed to creating and maintaining safe working conditions and following safe work procedures at the workplace for all of its employees. In addition, the Town of Hartford encourages employees and their dependents to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
B. We pledge our support through the establishment of a Safety and Health Committee and the
designation of a Wellness Coordinator to lead our efforts to provide resources, motivation and support to enhance the overall safety at the workplace and promote a healthy lifestyle for all of the Town of Hartford employees and their dependents.
C. It is the responsibility at the workplace of each employee to observe safe work practices, including but not limited to the wearing of appropriate protective clothing and/or equipment; following all prescribed work practices as presented in departmental policies and procedures, reporting to his/her supervisors all known medical or psychological conditions which pose a direct threat to the safety of the employee, the public or coworkers; and immediately reporting to his/her supervisor any dangerous or potentially dangerous work conditions. Failure to follow safe work procedures shall result in disciplinary action. The Town of Hartford is committed to creating and maintaining safe working conditions and following safe work procedures at all times and for all of its employees.
§ 350-31 Reporting work-related injuries.
All employees of the Town of Hartford are required to immediately report all work-related injuries to his/her supervisor. Failure to report such injuries may result in a delay in, or loss of, workers' compensation benefits. Workers' compensation reports and claims must be given to the Personnel Department for submission to the Town's insurance company and for appropriate follow-up. This report must include the completion of a first report of injury form within 24 hours of the injury.
§ 350-32 Harassment.
The Town is committed to having a diverse workforce with all employees being valued for their individual capabilities and contributions, complying with all federal and state laws regarding equal employment opportunity, and providing a workplace free from tensions involved in conduct that does not relate to the Town's business. In particular, the hostile atmosphere created by conduct including, but not limited to, ethnic, racial, sexual, or religious remarks, animosity, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other similar conduct is not permitted. Harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, ancestry, place of birth, age, physical or mental condition, HIV status or veteran status will not be tolerated and employees who engage in such conduct may be subject to discipline up to and including discharge. Harassment arises from the dynamics of the workplace and can be based on nuances, subtle perceptions, and implicit communications. Conduct that may rise to the level of harassment includes verbal remarks (epithets, derogatory statements, slurs, jokes), physical contact (assaults, physical interference with movement or work, touching), visual displays (displaying of printed or photographic materials, objects), and other actions that are demeaning or hostile.
A. Sexual harassment. It is against the policies of this Town, and illegal under state and federal law, for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another employee. The Town is committed to providing a workplace free from this unlawful conduct. It is a violation of this policy for an employee to engage in sexual harassment.
(1) What is "sexual harassment"?
(a) Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
[1] Submission to that conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment;
[2] Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a component of the basis for employment decisions affecting that individual; or
[3] The conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
(b) Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to the following, when such acts or behavior come within one of the above definitions:
[1] Either explicitly or implicitly conditioning any term of employment (e.g., continued employment, wages, evaluation, advancement, assigned duties or shifts) on the provision of sexual favors;
[2] Touching or grabbing a sexual part of an employee's body;
[3] Touching or grabbing any part of an employee's body after that person has indicated, or it is known, that such physical contact was unwelcome;
[4] Continuing to ask an employee to socialize on or off duty when that person has indicated he/she is not interested;
[5] Displaying or transmitting sexually suggestive pictures, objects, cartoons, or posters if it is known or should be known that the behavior is unwelcome;
[6] Continuing to write sexually suggestive notes or letters if it is known or should be known that the person does not welcome such behavior;
[7] Referring to or calling a person a sexualized name if it is known or should be known that the person does not welcome such behavior;
[8] Regularly telling sexual jokes or using sexually vulgar or explicit language in the presence of a person if it is known or should be known that the person does not welcome such behavior;
[9] Retaliation of any kind for having filed or supported a complaint of sexual harassment (e.g., ostracizing the person, pressuring the person to drop or not support the complaint, adversely altering that person's duties or work environment, etc.);
[10] Derogatory or provoking remarks about or relating to an employee's sex or sexual orientation;
[11] Harassing acts or behavior directed against a person on the basis of his or her sex or sexual orientation;
[12] Off-duty conduct which falls within the above definition and affects the work environment.
(2) What the employer will do if it learns of possible sexual harassment?
(a) In the event the Town receives a complaint of sexual harassment, or otherwise has reason to believe that sexual harassment is occurring, it will take all necessary steps to ensure that the matter is promptly investigated and addressed. Investigations will take place in accordance with the provisions of Subsection B below. The Town is committed, and required by law, to take action if it learns of potential sexual harassment, even if the aggrieved employee does not wish to formally file a complaint. Every supervisor is responsible for promptly responding to, or reporting, any complaint or suspected acts of sexual harassment. Supervisors should report to their department head, any other department head, and Assistant to the Town Manager for Human Resources or the Town Manager. Failure by a supervisor to appropriately report or address such sexual harassment complaints or suspected acts shall be considered to be in violation of this policy and may subject the supervisor to discipline up to and including discharge.
(b) Care will be taken to protect the identity of the person with the complaint and of the accused party or parties, except as may be reasonably necessary to successfully complete the investigation. For this reason, the Town cannot guarantee confidentiality to the complainant, the accused or any witnesses. It shall be a violation of this policy for any employee who learns of the investigation or complaint to take any retaliatory action that affects the working environment of any person involved in this investigation.
(c) If the allegation of sexual harassment is found to be credible, the Town will take appropriate
corrective action. The Town's representative will inform the complaining person and the accused person of the results of the investigation and generally what actions will be taken to ensure that the harassment will cease and that no retaliation will occur. Individuals other than the accused are not entitled to information concerning the precise nature of the discipline imposed, if any. Any employee, supervisor, or agent who has been found by the employer to have harassed another employee will be subject to sanctions appropriate to the circumstances, ranging from a verbal warning up to and including dismissal.
(d) If the allegation is not found to be credible, the person with the complaint and the accused person shall be so informed, with appropriate instruction provided to each, including the right of the complainant to contact any of the state or federal agencies identified in this policy notice.
(3) What you should do if you believe you have been harassed?
(a) Any employee who believes that she or he has been the target of sexual harassment, or who believes she or he has been subjected to retaliation for having brought or supported a complaint of harassment, is encouraged to directly inform the offending person or persons that such conduct is offensive and must stop (unless the employee does not wish to communicate directly with the alleged harasser or harassers, or if direct communication has been ineffective). In any event, the person with the complaint shall also report the situation as soon as possible to the employee's department head, any other department head, the Assistant to the Town Manager for Human Resources or the Town Manager and the matter will be promptly investigated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Subsection B below. It is helpful to an investigation if the employee keeps a diary of events and the names of people who witnessed or were told of the harassment, if possible.
(b) In all cases where a harassment complaint has been substantiated, the Town will make reasonable and appropriate follow-up inquiries with the complainant to ensure that the harassment has not resumed or that the complainant is not the subject of retaliation.
(c) If the complainant is dissatisfied with this employer's action, or is otherwise interested in doing so, she or he may file a complaint by writing or calling any of the following state or federal agencies:
[1] Vermont Attorney General's Office, Civil Rights Unit, 109 State Street, Montpelier, VT 05609, telephone: (802) 828-3171 (voice/TDD). Complaints should be filed within 300 days of the adverse action.
[2] Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1 Congress Street, Boston, MA 02114, telephone: (617) 565-3200 (voice), (617) 565-3204 (TDD). Complaints must be filed within 300 days of the adverse action.
[3] Vermont Human Rights Commission, 133 State Street, Montpelier, VT 05633-6301, telephone: (802) 828-2480 (voice/TDD). (Only if you are employed by a Vermont state agency.) Complaints must be filed within 360 days of the adverse action.
(d) Each of these agencies can conduct impartial investigations, facilitate conciliation, and if it finds that there is probable cause or reasonable grounds to believe sexual harassment occurred, it may take the case to court. Although employees are encouraged to file their complaint of sexual harassment through this employer's complaint procedure, an employee is not required to do so before filing a charge with these agencies.
(e) In addition, a complainant also has the right to hire a private attorney, and to pursue a private legal action in state court within three or six years, depending on the type of claims raised.
(4) Where can I get copies of this policy?
(a) A copy of this policy will be provided to every employee, and extra copies will be available in the
Town Manager's/Personnel Office.
(b) Reasonable accommodations will be provided for persons with disabilities who need assistance in filing or pursuing a complaint of harassment, upon advance request.
B. Investigations/violations for all harassment complaints.
(1) In the event this Town receives a complaint of harassment, or otherwise has reason to believe that harassment is occurring, it will take all necessary steps to ensure that the matter is promptly investigated and addressed. The Town is committed to take action if it learns of potential harassment as defined by these policies even if the aggrieved employee does not wish to formally file a complaint. Care will be taken to protect the identity of the person with the complaint and of the accused party or parties, except as may be reasonably necessary to successfully complete the investigation. For this reason, the Town cannot guarantee confidentiality to the complainant, the accused or any witnesses. An employee who believes that any of these antiharassment policies are being violated should 1) inform the offending person(s) that the conduct is unwelcome (unless the employee does not wish to communicate directly with the alleged harasser or harassers, or if direct communication has been ineffective) and 2) should report it immediately to his/her department head, any other department head, the Assistant to the Town Manger for Human Resources or the Town Manager. The initial report should be made in writing; however, a report will also be accepted by phone or in person. The complainant may be asked to provide written confirmation of the substance of the complaint at the initial reporting stage or soon thereafter.
(2) Charges that, if true, would substantiate a valid harassment complaint will be promptly and thoroughly investigated and corrective actions taken if the charge is substantiated. If it is determined that a violation has occurred, appropriate relief for the employee(s) bringing the complaint (including but not limited to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge), against the person(s) who violated the policy will follow.
(3) During the course of any investigation, the Town official designated to conduct the investigation may interview Town employees who have been named as witnesses to the alleged harassment. All Town employees interviewed in connection with a harassment investigation are expected to cooperate fully in the investigation by providing complete, accurate and truthful information. Town employees may also be expected to sign statements or other documents memorializing the information provided in the course of the investigation and may be asked to keep the substance of the interview confidential until such investigation is concluded. Town employees are expected to comply fully with the investigator and failure to do so may subject the employee to discipline up to and including discharge.
(4) In all cases where a harassment complaint has been substantiated, the Town will make reasonable and appropriate follow-up inquiries with the complainant to ensure that the harassment has not resumed or that the complainant is not the subject of retaliation.
(5) Reasonable accommodations will be provided for persons with disabilities who need assistance in filing or pursuing a complaint of harassment, upon advance request.
C. Retaliation.
(1) Retaliation is illegal and contrary to the policy of the Town. Employees who bring complaints of discrimination (or who identify potential violations), witnesses interviewed during the investigation, and others who may have opposed discriminatory conduct are protected from retaliatory acts.
(2) If an employee believes that he or she is being retaliated against, a report should be made following the same procedures applicable to harassment complaints as set forth in Subsection B above. Those who are found to be acting in a retaliatory manner may be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.
§ 350-33 Overtime.
A. Town employees may be requested to work overtime on occasion. The possibility of such overtime shall be included in the formal job descriptions of positions likely to incur overtime.
B. Requests for employees to work overtime will be made with as much advance notice as possible. However, unexpected circumstances or emergencies may arise which make advance notice impossible. Employees are expected to honor such requests for overtime work. Repeated failure or refusal to perform overtime work will result in disciplinary action. Supervisors and/or department heads will make every effort to distribute requests for overtime fairly amongst available employees within their departments.
C. No employee may work overtime without the express prior consent of his or her immediate supervisor or, in the event of an emergency in which the supervisor cannot be reached, the permission of the department head or the Town Manager.
§ 350-34 Limitation on multiple positions.
Town employees may only be employed on a regular basis in one department with the Town. Occasional or sporadic part-time employment with another department is permissible upon prior approval of the Town Manager. Such work must be of a type that is substantially different than the employee's primary employment with the Town and must be undertaken by choice of the employee and not by order of the Town.
§ 350-35 No smoking.
In recognition of the hazards that tobacco poses to the health of employees, and in accordance with 18 V.S.A. § 1421 et seq. and § 1741 et seq., the Town of Hartford hereby prohibits employees' use of tobacco in any form in all publicly owned buildings, offices and enclosed areas and, effective September 1, 2008, in all Town-owned vehicles.
§ 350-36 Drug-free workplace.
A. The Town of Hartford is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when an employee is working under the influence of alcohol or illegally uses drugs on the job, comes to work under the influence, or possesses, distributes or sells drugs in the workplace. An employee who is under the influence of alcohol or any drug on the job may pose serious safety and health risks not only to the user but to coworkers and the general public at large.
B. Town employees who are covered under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (including all holders of commercial driver's licenses) shall be subject to preemployment and regular random drug and alcohol testing in accordance with Department of Transportation rules and procedures.
C. The Town may also require an individual employee to submit to a drug test if there is probable cause to believe that the employee is using or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job as required by 21 V.S.A. § 513. The testing will be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in 21 V.S.A. § 512 et seq.
D. The Town of Hartford has also established the following policies:
(1) Employees shall be required, as a condition of their employment, to abide by the terms and conditions of this drug-free workplace policy.
(2) Employees involved in any unauthorized use, possession, transfer, sale, manufacture, distribution, purchase, or presence of drugs/alcohol or drug paraphernalia on Town of Hartford property or having reported to work with detectable levels of illegal drugs or alcohol may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination. If an employee's drug test is positive, and the employee agrees to participate in and successfully completes a bona fide rehabilitation program, then the
employee may not be terminated for the first offense. The employee may be suspended for the period of time necessary to complete the program, but in no event longer than three months. The employee may be terminated after completion of the rehabilitation program if he or she tests positive for drugs or alcohol thereafter. (Such testing must comply with 21 V.S.A. § 512 et seq.)
(3) An employee shall notify his supervisor/manager of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction. Failure to do so will result in discipline, up to and including dismissal.
(4) If a convicted employee works in a federally funded program, the involved federal grant agency shall be notified of the conviction within 10 days of the municipality's receiving the notice of the conviction. In the case of the Vermont Community Development Program, notice shall be given to the Department of Housing and Community Affairs.
(5) An employee convicted under any criminal drug statute for a violation occurring in the workplace, while on or off duty, or on duty away from the workplace, shall be immediately dismissed for the first offense.
(6) In the absence of compelling mitigating circumstances, an employee convicted under any criminal drug statute for a violation not occurring in the workplace while not on duty shall be subject to immediate dismissal for the first offense if convicted of a felony. If the conviction is not a felony, discipline up to and including dismissal may be imposed, including for the first offense.
(7) Appropriate disciplinary and/or corrective action is to be taken within 30 days after the employer receives notice of a conviction. This, however, is not to be construed to limit the authority of the employer to take such an action thereafter. Any disciplinary action must comply with the collective bargaining agreement, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1978, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act, if applicable.
(8) An employee not convicted under any criminal drug statutes, but who engages in the illegal manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of illegal drugs or controlled substances in any municipal workplace while on or off duty, or on duty away from the workplace, shall be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal for the first occurrence. An employee engaging in such actions while off duty and away from the workplace may be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal, including for the first offense.
(9) Any employee whose off-duty abuse of alcohol or illegal or prescription drugs results in excessive absenteeism or tardiness or is the cause of accidents or poor work performance may be subject to discipline, including termination.
(10) Any employee on municipal premises who appears to be under the influence of alcohol, or who possess illegal or nonmedically authorized drugs, or who has consumed alcohol or used such drugs on municipal premises, may be temporarily relieved from duty pending further investigation.
(11) If the use of legal drugs endangers safety, management may (but is not required to) reassign work on a temporary or permanent basis.
(12) Employees must observe other work rules established by their employing department regarding the use, possession or presence of drugs involving their employment.
(13) Each employee of the municipality will make a good-faith effort to maintain a drug-free workplace and uphold and promote this policy.
§ 350-37 Use of drugs.
A. Legal drugs.
(1) Legal drugs are those medications (containing drugs or other controlled substances) that are prescribed to an individual by an authorized physician, carried in its original container that is labeled by a licensed pharmacist, and taken as directed.
(2) For certain positions, the legal use of a drug can pose a significant risk to the safety of the employee or others. Employees who feel or have been informed that the use of such a drug may present a safety risk are to report such drug use to their immediate supervisor.
B. Unauthorized/illegal drugs include but are not limited to narcotics, marijuana, hashish, cocaine, alcohol and controlled substances or medications other than those legally sold to the public on a nonprescription basis or those prescribed to an employee by a duly licensed physician. The use, sale, purchase, transfer or possession of an illegal drug by an employee while in a municipal facility while performing municipal business or while on the job is prohibited. Being under the influence of alcohol or any illegal drug while conducting municipal business, while on municipality property or in a municipal facility, or while operating any municipal equipment is prohibited. Misuse of prescription drugs is considered to be the illegal use of drugs. This includes both the use of such drugs in a manner inconsistent with the prescribed use and any use of prescription drugs by persons for whom they are not prescribed.
C. Responsibilities.
(1) Employer. It is the responsibility of each municipal supervisor/manager to advise each employee of this policy; to post the policy annually at each work site; to include a copy of this policy in each new employee's orientation.

§ 350-41 Seniority.

§ 350-43 Temporary alternative duty (TAD).
A. Temporary Alternative duty (TAD) is intended to encourage an employee's transition back to the workplace after an illness or injury. It is not the Town's intention to cause employees to return to work before they are medically able or for them to perform work for which they are not medically suited or capable to perform.
B. Employees who are unable to perform their usual duties due to a temporary medical disability or workers' compensation injury and may therefore be absent from work but who can, with the concurrence of competent medical authority, perform "light duty," may be assigned to any tasks within their capabilities including assignments to other Town departments where appropriate.
C. Prior to assigning an employee to TAD, the department head shall supply the employee's attending physician with a description of the intended light-duty assignment.

A. The Town provides its employees with a variety of computer-based equipment and capabilities. This equipment/services are intended to assist employees in executing their work in the interest of the Town.

D. In addition, it is important for employees to be mindful that information stored on or produced by this system/equipment (computers, network, servers, telephone voice mail systems) is considered the property of the Town of Hartford and therefore public. Employees should have no expectation of privacy in their use of Town-owned computer equipment or other electronic systems and are cautioned against using the system (e.g., e-mail, Internet, telephone voice mail systems, etc.) to process, generate access or store information of a personal nature or use. All information generated by or stored on Town-owned equipment shall be considered public and as public property could be subject to public disclosure, review by other Town employees, supervisors and subpoena, etc.

This determination shall be based, in part, upon considerations of the qualifications of the employees, the evaluations received and the length of time with the Town.
B. Employees with the least departmental seniority shall be laid off first. However, a more senior employee may be laid off if that employee does not have the skills or qualifications required to do the available work, and a less senior employee does have the required skills or qualifications.
C. Employees who are notified that they are to be laid off shall have the right to "bump" a less senior employee in that employee's own department, provided that the employee has the skills or qualifications required to do the work of the "bumped" employee. Such an action shall be considered to be a voluntary request for demotion, if the position being sought is at a lower classification.
§ 350-82 Recall.
It is the policy of the Town to recall employees who are on layoff as vacancies occur within the Town service for which the employees are qualified. Such recall shall be used to fill vacancies before new employees are recruited or hired.
A. Order of recall. Employees who are on layoff shall be recalled in order of seniority within the Department which is increasing its work force. The employee with the most seniority will be recalled first; provided however, that the employee has the skills or qualifications required to do the available work.
B. Qualifications. Whether an employee has the skills or qualifications to perform available work will be determined by the Town Manager. The Town may use an evaluation process which fairly measures an employee's past work, present job abilities, and the employee's potential for improvement.
C. Reporting after recall. An employee who is on layoff and is recalled must notify the Town of his/her intention to return to work on a certain date within three working days of the recall notice. Recall notices shall be sent to the employee's last known address. Failure to notify the Town within three working days shall result in a loss of all seniority and further recall rights. In exceptional or unusual circumstances, the Town Manager may extend the reporting period to a maximum of five working days.
D. Limitation. An employee who is on layoff and who has not received notification of recall within one year from the date of layoff shall lose all seniority and recall rights.
§ 350-83 Grievances.
A. For the purposes of this document, the term "grievance" shall refer to any dispute, interpretation, application or violation of the terms and conditions of these policies and procedures. The following procedures are intended to provide employees with a specific process for redressing such concerns. This process may also be used to address other concerns of employees that may be outside the content of this document.

The supervisor will respond in writing to the employee within seven working days of his/her receipt of the employee's grievance. The response will include the basis for his/her decision.
(b) In the event that an employee is not satisfied with the response to the grievance, he/she may appeal the matter to Step 2 of this procedure.
(2) Step 2:
(a) The employee may submit within seven working days of the Step 1 decision, his/her grievance to the department head. Submission of a grievance to the department head will include all materials submitted in Step 1.

In the event that an employee is not satisfied with the response to the grievance, he/she may appeal the matter to Step 4 of this procedure.
(4) Step 4: The employee may submit within seven working days of the Step 3 decision, his/her grievance to the Selectboard.

This interview shall include a review of accrued vacation, conversion of health insurance rights, other insurance coverage, clearance of any other accounts, and any other questions that may arise concerning the termination of employment.
B. The exit interview should be completed before the employee will receive his/her final paycheck; however, when appropriate such an interview may be conducted over the phone or by mail if necessary. The exit interview will become a permanent part of the employee's personnel file.

§ 260-2. Intent.
It is the intent of these Zoning Regulations to provide for orderly community growth and to
further the purposes established in Section 4302 of the Act.1 No provision of these regulations
may have the effect of excluding from the municipality housing to meet the needs of the

after consultation with the Planning Commission.
B. An Acting Administrative Officer may be appointed by the Selectboard, from

null and void and reapplication to complete any activities shall be required. Any
activities not completed within the above permit period shall be subject to any ordinance
in effect at the time of reapplication. One six-month extension to both time periods may
be granted by the Planning Commission. The start of activities, as referred to above, shall
consist of excavation or nonreversible site preparation, such as the cutting of trees.

F. No permit issued pursuant to this section shall take effect until the time for appeal as
defined in 24 V.S.A. § 4465 has passed; or in the event that a notice of appeal is
properly filed, no such permit shall take effect until adjudication of that appeal by the
appropriate municipal panel is complete and the time for taking an appeal to the
Environmental Court has passed without an appeal being taken. If an appeal is taken to
the Environmental Court, the permit shall not take effect until adjudication by the
Environmental Court.

Officer shall be posted by the applicant at the site for which the permit is issued so that it
is conspicuous.

on the form provided by the Town, and shall include the name and address of the
appellant, a brief description of the property with respect to which the appeal is taken, a
reference to the regulatory provisions applicable to that appeal, the relief requested by the

B. The Zoning Map entitled "White River Junction, Design Review District Boundary Map,
First Floor Commercial Use Boundary Map" is hereby incorporated into these regulations
as the official map to delineate the White River Junction Design Review District
described in § 260-45 of these regulations, and the official map delineating the area in
the Central Business District which is restricted to commercial uses only for the first
floor street frontage portion of buildings, as described in § 260-20 of these regulations.
§ 260-13. Copies of Zoning Maps.
Regardless of the existence of other printed copies of .the three Zoning Maps referenced in
§ 260-12, which from time to time may be made or published, the official Zoning Maps,
which shall be located in the office of the Town Clerk, shall be the final authority as to the
current zoning status of the land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the Town.
§ 260-14. District boundaries.
District boundaries shown within the lines of roads, streams and transportation rights-of-way
shall be deemed to follow the center lines. The abandonment of roads shall not affect the
location of district boundaries. When the Administrative Officer cannot definitely determine
the location of a district boundary by such center lines, by the scale or dimensions stated on
the Zoning Map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, the Officer shall
refer the matter to the Planning Commission, which shall interpret the location of the district
boundary with reference to the scale of the Zoning Map and the purposes set forth in all
relevant provisions of these regulations.
§ 260-15. Permitted uses.
Permitted uses are those which may be approved by the Administrative Officer, providing the
standards established by these regulations are met. Permits for permitted uses will be issued
by the Administrative Officer. However, where a variance or other special action by the
Zoning Board of Adjustment is required, or where approvals of a site development plan is
required by the Planning Commission, the issuance of permits by the Administrative Officer
must await and is contingent upon such approval.
§ 260-16. Conditional uses.
Conditional uses are those for which a permit may not be issued by the Administrative Officer
until such use has been approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment after public notice and
hearing; as provided for in § 4414(3) of the Act. In addition, certain specified uses and
structures which exceed the limits which would otherwise apply to them under these
260:7 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-16 HARTFORD CODE § 260-16

escrow account, or other surety in a form acceptable to the Town to assure
one or more of the following: the completion of the project, adequate
stabilization, or protection of public facilities that may be affected by a
project.
(2) The Board may require that no zoning permit, except for any permits that may be
required for infrastructure construction, may be issued unless the streets and other
required public improvements have been satisfactorily installed in accordance with
the approval decision and pertinent bylaws. In lieu of the completion of the
required public improvements, the Board may require for the benefit of the
municipality a performance bond or other security issued either by a bonding or
surety company approved by the legislative body or by the owner with security
acceptable to the legislative body in an amount sufficient to cover the full cost of
those new streets and required improvements on or in those streets or highways
and their maintenance for a period of two years after completion as is estimated by
the Town. This bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public,
the completion of any improvements that may be required within the period fixed
in the subdivision bylaws for that completion and for the maintenance of those
improvements for a period of two years after completion. Any costs incurred by
the Town related to the performance bond or other securities are the responsibility
of the applicant and/or property owner.

§ 260-16 HARTFORD CODE § 260-17
(3) The performance bond required by this subsection shall run for a term to be fixed
by the Board, but in no case for a longer term than three years. However, with the
consent of the owner, the term of that bond may be extended for an additional
period not to exceed three years. If any required improvements have not been
installed or maintained as provided within the term of the performance bond, the
bond shall be forfeited to the municipality, and upon receipt of the proceeds of the
bond, the Town shall install or maintain such improvements as are covered by the
performance bond.
C. Changes to an approved use.
(1) Any . enlargement or alteration of a conditional use shall be reviewed as a
conditional use by the Zoning Board of Adjustment to permit the specifying of
new conditions. Exemptions: amendments to an approved conditional use which, in
the opinion of the Chair or Vice Chair of the Zoning Board of Adjustment and
Administrative Officer, are minor and have no adverse effect in terms of the
approval criteria outlined in Subsection A. Changes which involve a variance will
not be considered minor.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in Artide V, a change in use, expansion or
contraction of land, area, or alteration of structures or uses which are designated as
a conditional use within the district in which they are located and are existing
therein prior to the effective date of these amendments shall conform to all
regulations herein pertaining to conditional uses, and shall not be commenced
unless and until a permit is issued by the Zoning Board of Adjustment for such
change, expansion, construction or alteration under this section.
§ 260-17. Accessory uses.
Accessory uses are those uses which are not specifically listed for a zoning district in
§ 260-20 and are on the same lot with and of a nature which the Administrative Officer
determines is incidental and subordinate to the principal use or structure. Appeals from the
Administrative Officer's determination may be made to the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
A. Accessory uses shall not significantly alter:
( 1) The character of the area affected;
(2) Traffic on roads and highways in the vicinity;
(3) The principal use of the property.

§ 260-18 ZONING § 260-20
§ 260-18. Dwelling unit density.
In every case, the Administrative Officer shall determine the maximum number of dwelling
units permitted on any lot by dividing the lot size, provided by a survey (furnished by the
owner and sealed by a Vermont registered land surveyor), by the minimum area per dwelling
unit standards for the district in which the lot is located. In all cases such determination shall
be rounded to the nearest whole number.
§ 260-19. Classification of lots, source of water and sewage service.
A The tables set forth in § 260-20 make reference to the "class" of lot, a distinction which
is based on the means by which a lot receives potable water and/or sewage disposal
service. The classes are follows:
Lot Classification

§ 260-21 HARTFORD CODE § 260-21
§ 260-21. Overlay Districts.
A Purpose. The Hartford Master Plan identifies many areas throughout the Town that
encompass significant natural resources and have particular importance to the Town's
rural character. These areas make Hartford a special place and represent the Town's
heritage of working farms and forest lands as part of a sustainable, environmentally
sound, local-resource-based economy. These areas include such features as prime and
statewide agricultural soils, forests, wetlands, riparian areas, steep slopes, important
wildlife habitat, scenic views, ridgelines and hillsides. Since they are located in multiple
zoning districts, and the characteristics· of these areas vary, special overlay zoning
districts are established in sections of the Town to ensure sufficient protection of these
important features. It is not the Town's intent to prevent development in the overlay
districts, but rather to have appropriate placement of development to minimize impacts
on these areas as much as possible.
B. General provisions for Rural Lands, Agricultural, and wildlife Connector Overlay
Districts.
(1) Objective: to promote the preservation of the rural character, sensitive features and
natural resources, including prime agricultural soils, wetlands, steep slopes,
important wildlife habitat, scenic views, ridgelines and hillsides, in the Rural
Lands, Agricultural, and Wildlife Connector Overlay Districts.
(2) Effect on existing regulations. These overlay district standards are intended to
supplement the development regulations and standards set forth in the underlying
zoning districts, and shall not repeal or alter any existing ordinances, regulations,
or bylaws of the Town of Hartford except as provided herein.
(3) District boundaries. These standards shall apply to all land within the Rural
Lands Zoning Districts (RL-1, RL-3, RL-5, RL-10 and FC) referred to as the
"Rural Lands Overlay District," and all lands within the Agricultural and Wildlife
Connector Overlay Districts as identified in the most recently adopted Hartford
Master Plan.
( 4) Supplemental development standards.
(a) All development and subdivisions should be laid out so they integrate
carefully into the natural resources while protecting and minimizing
fragmentation of land, and adverse visual and environmental impacts on these
natural resources. To achieve this, the following supplemental standards shall
apply:
[1] Subdivisions creating two or more new lots will meet major subdivision
requirements, including a detailed mapping of natural resources. Given
the extent of sensitive natural resources, the Planning Commission may
require a planned development for the site in accordance with§ 260-47
of these regulations.
[2] Development envelopes and associated development shall be located
down-slope of ridgelines and prominent hills in areas where ridgelines
and hillsides are easily visible from existing roadways, and shall be
260:12 11 - 01 - 2009
(
( ·
(
§ 260-21 ZONING § 260-21
considered relative to the availability of less visible locations on-site.
Additional landscaping may be required to screen development to
reduce visibility.
[3] When locating structures, roads, driveways, utility corridors and
rights-of-way, one or more of the following should be employed:
[a] Place improvements at the wooded edge and/or nearby developed
areas. If not possible, place improvements in a manner that
minimizes encroachment in wooded areas and open fields.
[b] Follow existing contours, roads, tree lines, and stone walls.
[c] Share roads, driveways, utility corridors and rights-of-way.
[d] Place developments and subdivisions close to roads.
[e] Follow established settlement patterns.
[4] Locate development such that it will not conflict with existing
agricultural uses in the area, and provide adequate buffers between
potentially conflicting uses.
[5] Create an efficient use of land that results in cluster development, small
networks of utilities and roads, and large sections of unfragmented land.
[6] Any other rules and regulations that the Planning Commission may
prescribe to supplement these standards, provided these rules and
regulations are not inconsistent with the Zoning Regulations.
(b) In addition to the overlay district general provisions set forth in these
regulations, the following additional provisions specific to the Agricultural
and Wildlife Connector Overlay Districts shall be followed.
C. Agriculture Overlay District.
(1) Objective: to promote the continuation of agriculture, retain the maximum
possible amount of agricultural lands, which often provide important scenic views,
protect historically viable farmland and prime and statewide agricultural soils, and
preserve Hartford's rural character, scenic characteristics, including open lands,
views, and working landscape qualities in accordance with the Hartford Master
Plan.
(2) Supplemental development standards. In addition to the general provisions for
all overlay districts specified in Subsection B above, all development and
subdivisions involving lands in an Agricultural Overlay District are subject to the
following supplemental standards:
(a) Development envelopes shall be located at field edges or, in the event that no
other land is practical for development, on the least fertile soils in order to
minimize the use of productive agricultural land and impacts on existing farm
operations.
260:13 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-21 HARTFORD CODE § 260-21
(b) Buildings should be clustered to avoid the fragmentation of productive
farmland/open land.
D. Wildlife Connector Overlay District.
(1) Objective: to provide sufficient area for animals to move freely between
conserved lands, undeveloped private lands, contiguous forest habitat, and other
important habitat, land features, and natural communities within and beyond the
boundaries of the Town in order to meet their necessary survival requirements.
(2) Supplemental development standards. In addition to the general provisions for
all overlay districts specified in Subsection B above, all development and
subdivisions involving lands in a Wildlife Connector Overlay District are subject
to the following supplemental standards:
(a) Development will be encouraged close to roads and/or developed areas to
allow sufficient wildlife corridors through the area.
(b) A buff er area of adequate size from the edge of development shall be
established to ensure the protection of critical wildlife habitats and travel
corridors.
(c) Written review from the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife regarding
the impact of the proposed development on the wildlife corridor and
significant wildlife habitats when requested by the Planning Commission for
site development plan and subdivision applications or by the Administrative
Officer for zoning permits.
E. Application review procedures.
(1) Site development plan and subdivision applications. As part of a site
development plan or subdivision application, all commercial, industrial,
multifamily residential development or subdivision applications in overlay districts
are required to demonstrate how the proposed project adheres to the overlay
districts standards addressed in Subsection B above. Wireless communication
facilities in compliance with§ 260-39 are exempt from meeting this requirement.
(2) Administrative review process. Except for exemptions identified in Subsection
E(3) below, residential uses, including new single-unit dwellings, and two-unit
dwellings, residential additions, and accessory structures are required to submit an
administrative application to the Administrative Officer indicating how the
proposed project adheres to the overlay districts standards addressed in Subsection
B above. If the Administrative Officer determines that the application adheres to
the supplemental development standards as applicable in Subsections B(4), C(2)
and D(2), the permit will be issued. However, if the Administrative Officer
determines that the applicable development standards cannot be met, the
application will be denied. The applicant may then submit a notice of appeal to the
Zoning Board of Adjustment as described in § 260-4H of these regulations.

(a) Parking in the front setback.
[1] Single-family, accessory apartments and two-family units. Parking
may occupy up to 50% of the front lot line of the parcel without the
approval of the Planning Commission. For corner lots, the front lot line
shall be defined as the side with access to a public or private road.
[2] Other uses. Parking areas shall be located behind the front building line
of a structure unless approved by the Planning Commission.
(b) Landscaping. The site shall be designed and landscaped to ffi1Il11Illze
negative visual impacts and maximize safety. Plantings may be required for
this purpose, both within the lot and between it and any public road or
adjacent property. Plants shall not be invasive to Vermont, shall be selected
for their ability to survive under special conditions found in a parking lot,
and shall be protected from damage by vehicles and maintenance equipment,
including snow removal and storage.
(c) Defining parking area. The outside edges of the parking lot shall be
delineated by curbing, fencing, or other means that will confine vehicles to
the areas intended for parking.
(d) Parking on lawns. Parking shall not be allowed on lawns unless it is

§ 260-24 ZONING § 260-24
( d) Excess parldng. Parking shall not be constructed for any building or use in
excess of the number specified above without the approval of the Planning
Commission as specified in Subsection C(9)(e).
( e) Modification of parldng requirements.
[1] If, in site plan approval proceedings or at any time in the future after a
duly warned hearing, the Planning Commission determines that unique
usage or special conditions exist which warrant increasing or reducing
the need for parking, it may require the provision of off-street parking
spaces up to 50% more or less than the requirements in Subsection
C(9)(a) above. In the Central Business District, the parking may be
reduced beyond 50%. When approving an increase or reduction in any
zoning district, the Planning Commission shall consider the following:
[a] Is the site located on or within 1,000 feet of a transit route?
[b] Are there shared parking facilities with abutting businesses which
are sufficient to meet parking demand?
[c] For mixed-use projects, do the proposed uses have staggered
business hours with minimal overlap?
[ d] Does the type of business proposed generate substantial pedestrian
traffic and are adequate pedestrian facilities present?
[e] Does an employer-sponsored "transit pass" program, or vanpool,
carpool or rideshare program exist or can one be established (as a
condition of the approval) to substantially reduce the need for
on-site parking?
[f] Is safe and adequate on-street parking available?
[g] Is parking in municipal parking lots available?
[h] Does the Institute of Traffic Engineers, American Planning
Association or other professional source show parking demand
requirements for the proposed use(s) that are different than the
standards specified in these regulations?
[i] Is there other information that justifies a change in the parking
requirements?
[2] Any reduction in required parking shall apply to the uses specified by
the Planning Commission at the time of application only. In so reducing
the required number of spaces, the Planning Commission shall:
[a] Specify some or all of the parking spaces as permanently reduced
or as deferred parking [see Subsection C(lO) following].
[b] Specify that no parking space designated for shared parking under
the provisions of this subsection shall be assigned or reserved for a
260:23 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-24 HARTFORD CODE § 260-24
particular party or use unless expressly authorized by the Planning
Commission.
[ c] Document precisely the calculation procedure used in determining
the required number of spaces. In no case shall the parking be
reduced below 100% of the largest parking generator as
determined under Subsection C(9)(a) above.
(f) Traffic study. The Commission may require an applicant for site plan
approval to submit a traffic study, at the applicant's expense, by a qualified
transportation professional, specializing in the field of traffic analysis, of
estimates of daily and peak-hour traffic generation.
(10) Deferred construction of parking spaces.
(a) When the Planning Commission approves a reduction in parking as provided
for in Subsection C(9)(e) above, it may defer the construction of the required
parking spaces until such time as it determines, after a hearing, that the
spaces are needed.
(b) Space for deferred parking shall be labeled "Future Parking" on the site plan
and landscaped until needed.
(c) The Planning Commission may require a letter of credit or other financial
security instrument adequate to ensure that parking spaces will be constructed
when they are needed.
D. ()ff-streetloading.
(1) For every building erected, altered or extended for the purpose of business, trade
or industry, there shall be off-street space for loading and unloading vehicles as
follows:
(a) Wholesale, warehouse, freight and trucking terminals: one for every 7,500
square feet of floor area;
(b) All other: one for every 10,000 square feet of floor area.
(2) Off-street loading spaces shall be scaled to the size of delivery vehicles expected
and configured to maximize convenience for pick-up and delivery of bulk items.
They shall be located in such a way as to minimize interactions with private
vehicles and pedestrians and maximize safety in entering the public way. Required
off-street loading space is not to be included as off-street parking space.
(3) When an existing use is changed or altered, the requirements of Subsection D(l)
may be reduced by the Planning Commission if it finds there will be no traffic or
safety hazard created. ·

§ 260-25 ZONING § 260-25
§ 260-25. Protection of surface waters.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect water quality, reduce property loss,
and preserve wildlife habitat by maintaining a riparian buffer (an undisturbed vegetated
buffer) along surface waters. Riparian buffers provide many valuable functions, including
filtering pollution and sediment from surface runoff, stabilizing streambanks to reduce
erosion, regulating water temperatures vital for fish, and controlling floodwaters by
limiting runoff and slowing water velocity.
B. Affected areas. A riparian buffer shall be maintained for a minimum of 100 feet from
the top of the bank of the Connecticut, Ottauquechee and White Rivers, or for a
minimum of 30 feet from the edge of a stream or any other surface water identified on
the most recent edition of the Hartford G.l.S. Natural Resources Map. The riparian buffer
also includes the area between the river and the top of the bank. No development,
excavation, filling, clearing or grading shall occur within the buffer without conditional
use approval from the Zoning Board of Adjustment except as specified in Subsections D
and E.
C. Surface water determination. Surface water includes all rivers, streams, brooks, creeks,
ponds, lakes, and reservoirs identified on the most recent edition of the Hartford G.I.S.
Natural Resources Map. Surface water excludes any isolated ponds and permitted
stormwater detention ponds. If the accuracy of the map is questioned, a site visit will be
made to determine the specific location of the surface water, including the top of bank or
edge of water.
D. Exemptions and buffer width reductions.
(1) Exemptions.
(a) Structures, lawns, mowed or cut areas, gardens, agricultural lands, golf
courses, parks, athletic turf fields and trails existing before the adoption of
these regulations that occur within the riparian buffer are allowed to continue
to be maintained, provided that they are maintained at least once every three
years.
(b) Projects that have a Riparian Buffer Management Plan with the.Agency of
Natural Resources or Act 250 which was approved prior to the adoption of
these regulations.
(c) Emergency repairs of damage caused by flooding or other natural disasters.
(2) Buffer width reductions.
(a) On existing lots of 1.00 acre or less, the buffer width requirement is reduced
by 50% without the need of a conditional use permit.
(b) For home gardens, the buffer width requirement is reduced to 25 feet without
the need for a conditional use permit. Gardens no longer being used must be
allowed to return to a naturally vegetated condition.
E. Allowable uses and activities. The following uses are allowed, provided that the least
possible area of existing riparian vegetation is disturbed and disturbed riparian areas are
260:25 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-25 HARTFORD CODE § 260-25
replanted with a mixture of native or noninvasive trees, shrubs, and grasses. Disturbed
areas that will not be replanted for one week shall be temporarily mulched. Disturbed
areas that will not be replanted within three weeks shall be temporarily seeded and
mulched and stabilized by the use of other methods that may be needed to prevent
erosion. Replanting must be completed within one year.
(1) Tree pruning and selective tree removal, provided that it results in minimal breaks
to the tree canopy.
(2) Installation of fences and signs and incidental recreational items such as canoe
racks, picnic tables, barbecue grills, trash receptacles and benches or similar minor
items, provided that they are installed on a pervious surface.
(3) Removal of nonnative nuisance species as defined as noxious weeds by the
Vermont Department of Agriculture.
(4) Archaeological investigations coordinated with the Vermont Agency of Natural
Resources and the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation.
(5) Removal of trees and shrubs to enhance views, provided the frontage area does not
exceed a total of 25 linear feet along the shoreline; the stumps and root systems of
removed vegetation remain intact in the ground wherever possible; and the area is
replanted with native or noninvasive shrubs and grasses. This twenty-five-foot
allowance includes any existing clearings. Additional surface water protection
measures are required as stated in Subsection F(l)(b) and Acceptable Management
Practices for Maintaining Water Quality on Logging Jobs in Vermont (Section 1,
#8; surface water and stream crossing protective strips; and Section 14, protective
strips).
(6) Docks. To minimize their impact, a dock on shoreline property must adhere to the
following standards:
(a) The dock is mounted on piles or floats.
(b) The dock shall be built in a way that does not alter shoreline banks; for
example, no excavation or grading of shoreline soils.
(c) The dock may be part of the twenty-five-foot frontage area that has been
cleared for a view. Otherwise, buffer vegetation shall be left undisturbed
beyond three feet of the sides of the dock so it results in minimal breaks to
the tree canopy.
( d) The dock shall be limited in size to four feet by 24 feet and shall not exceed
20% of the width of the water body. If a larger dock is proposed, a
conditional use permit application is required.
(e) If stairs to the dock are proposed for access, the stairs must be no wider than
six feet and be constructed over the bank rather than by steps cut into the
bank.

§ 260-25 ZONING § 260-25
(7) Private connections to Town water and sewer lines. This requires additional
surface water protection measures listed in Subsection F(l)(a) and (b).
(8) Underground or overhead gas, telephone, electric, steam, water or sewer collection,
distribution or transmission systems maintained by public utilities, municipal or
other governmental agencies; includes equipment and accessories used by such
systems but not buildings. This requires additional surface water protection
measures listed in Subsection F(l)(b), (c) and (d).
(9) Installation of driveway culverts to serve drainage ditches along Town highways;
installation of other culverts serving driveways that cross surface waters as lorig as
the finished grade does not exceed a height of six feet above the bottom of the
culvert, the culvert shall be properly sized, and additional surface water protection
measures listed in Subsection F(l)(b), (c) and (d) are used.
(10) Expansion of a legal noncomplying structure as permitted in § 260-55 of the
Zoning Regulations. This requires additional surface water protection measures
listed in Subsection F(l)(b), (c) and (d).
F. Applications.
(1) A conditional use permit is required for any activity in affected areas of Subsection
B which is not exempt under Subsections D and E. Prior to granting conditional
use permit approval, the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall assess whether the
basic project purpose can be achieved by moving the proposed construction,
excavation, filling or grading to a site outside of the buffer. If such a move is not
possible, the proposed use must then be designed to minimize adverse impacts on
existing riparian vegetation, water quality and the integrity of the buffer, provided
that:
(a) The least possible area of existing riparian vegetation is disturbed.
(b) Disturbed riparian areas are replanted with a mixture of native or noninvasive
trees, shrubs, and grasses. Areas that will not be replanted for one week shall
be temporarily mulched. Areas that will not be replanted within three weeks
shall be temporarily seeded and mulched and stabilized by the use of other
methods that may be needed to prevent erosion. Replanting must be
completed within one year.
( c) Erosion and sediment control measures are followed as specified in the most
current edition of the Low Risk Site Handbook for Erosion Prevention and
Sediment Control published by the Vermont Department of Environmental
Conservation.
(d) Tree and shrub removal results in minimal breaks to the canopy, the stumps
and root systems of removed vegetation remain intact in the ground wherever
possible; the area is replanted with native or noninvasive shrubs and grasses
and the method used complies with the most current standards of Acceptable
Management Practices for Maintaining Water Quality on Logging Jobs in
Vermont.

provision and those of § 206-31 below are met. Cutting in excess of these limits shall require
a conditional use permit.
A. Except when wooded land is being cleared for immediate conversion to another purpose,
no cutting shall be permitted within 200 feet of any public road, public waterway, stream
or brook which leaves the standing merchantable timber at less than 50% of that standing
at the beginning of the first harvest after the effective date of these amendments.
B. Whenever any logging, timber cutting, wood cutting or sawmill operation takes place, the
person(s) responsible for such operation shall dispose of any slash and mill waste
produced so that none shall remain:
(1) In any public water body, river, stream or brook;

without instruments at the property line.
E. Illumination from lighting fixtures or other light sources shall be shielded or of such low
intensity as not to cause undue glare, reflected glare, sky glow, or a nuisance to traffic or
abutting properties. Lights used to illuminate parking areas and drives shall be so
arranged and designed as to deflect light downward and away from adjacent residential
areas and public highways. Lights shall be of a "downshield luminaire" type where the
light source is not visible from any public highway or from adjacent properties. Only
fixtures which are shielded to not expose a light source, and which do not allow light to
"flood" the property, are permitted to be attached to buildings. Searchlights are not
permitted.
F. Fire, explosive and similar safety hazards which would substantially increase the risk to
an abutting property, or which would place an unreasonable burden on the Fire
Department, shall be prohibited.

(
§ 260-39 ZONING § 260-39
E. Review standards. Prior to granting such approval, the Planning Commission and
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall make affirmative findings for each of the following
criteria in addition to the other applicable provisions set forth in this section (wireless
communication facilities), § 260-16 (conditional uses), and § 260-45 (site development
plan approval):
(1) Setbacks. (Planning Commission). Wireless communication facilities shall comply
with the setback provisions of the zoning district in which the facility is located.
(2) Fall zones (Planning Commission).
(a) Fall zones for existing and new ground-mounted facilities. To ensure
public safety, the minimum distance of any ground-mounted wireless service
facility to any property line, habitable dwelling, business, right-of-way,
institutional or public building shall be no less than the height of the facility,
including antennas or vertical appurtenances. This setback shall be referred to
as a "fall zone." The fall zone may cross property lines, so long as the
applicant secures a fall zone easement from the affected property owner(s).
The area of the easement shall be shown on all applicable plans submitted to
the Town, and the terms of the easement shall be provided as part of the site
development plan review.
(b) Fall zones for non-ground-mounted facilities. In the event that an existing
structure such as a building, barn silo, church steeple, or utility pole is
proposed as a mounting for a wireless communication facility, a fall zone
setback shall not be required.
(3) Height limitations. (Zoning Board of Adjustment).
(a) Height limitations for ground-mounted facilities/towers. In order to
protect public safety and to preserve the scenic character and appearance of
the area, the height limit for a wireless communication facility, antennas and
facility-related fixtures in all districts shall not exceed 20 feet above the
average height of the tree line within 150 feet of the base of the facility.
Notwithstanding the above, an additional height not to exceed 20 feet may be
approved upon a finding by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, as part of the
conditional use review, that the additional height is necessary in order to
provide adequate coverage, or to accomplish collocation as outlined in
Subsection E(ll), and that the additional height will not have an adverse
visual impact on the scenic character or appearance of the area as per
Subsection E(14).
(b) Height increase for existing structures and buildings. In the event that an
existing structure (other than a wireless communication tower) is proposed as
a mount for a wireless communication facility, the height of the structure
shall not be increased by more than 15 feet above the highest point of a flat
or mansard roof or 15 feet above the midpoint of other roofs unless the
facility is completely camouflaged; for example, a facility within a flagpole,
steeple or chimney. The increase in the height of the structure shall be in
scale and proportionality to the structure as originally configured. A provider
260:41 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-39 HARTFORD CODE § 260-39
may locate a wireless communication facility on a building that is legally
nonconforming with respect to height, provided that the provisions of this
section are met.
(4) Camouflaging facilities (Zoning Board of Adjustment). New ground-mounted
wireless communication facilities shall not be located within open areas or on or
near the top of a ridge. To the greatest extent feasible, all wireless communication
facilities shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the
use of existing vegetation, landscaping and screening, the use of compatible
materials and colors, or other camouflaging techniques.
(a) Camouflage for ground-mounted facilities/towers. A buffer of dense tree
growth that extends continuously for a minimum distance of 150 feet from
the mount shall surround new ground-mounted wireless communication
facilities. Such buffer shall screen views of the facility in all directions. The
trees must be existing on the subject property, planted on site, or within a
landscape easement on an adjoining site. The Planning Commission shall
have the authority to decrease, relocate, or alter the required buffer based on
site conditions and add other conditions to the permit regarding screening and
landscaping. The vegetated buffer area shall be protected by a landscape
easement or be within the area of the provider's lease. The easement or lease
shall specify that the trees within the buffer shall be maintained and shall not
be removed or trimmed, unless the trees are dead or dying and present a
hazard to persons or property, or approval is granted by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment.
(b) Camouflage for facilities on existing buildings or structures: roof
mounts. When a wireless communication facility extends above the roof
height of a building on which it is mounted, every effort shall be made to
conceal or camouflage the facility within or behind existing or new
architectural features to limit its visibility from public ways. Facilities
mounted on a roof shall be stepped back from the front facade in order to
limit their impact on the building's silhouette.
( c) Camouflage for facilities on existing buildings or structures: side mounts.
Wireless communication facilities that are side-mounted shall be
camouflaged.
( d) Camouflaging for equipment shelters. Equipment shelters shall be
camouflaged behind an effective year-round landscape buffer at the time of
planting, equal to or greater than the height of the proposed building, and/or
wooden fence as determined by the Planning Commission as part of site
development plan review. If mounted on a rooftop, the equipment shelter
shall be concealed or camouflaged so that the shelter either is not visible at
grade or appears to be part of the original structure.
(5) Lighting (Planning Commission).
(a) Wireless communication facility lighting. Wireless communication facilities
shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not display lights unless
260:42 11 - 01 - 2009
(
(
,
(
"·
§ 260-39 ZONING § 260-39
such lighting is specifically required by the FAA or other federal or state
authority for a particular wireless communication facility because of its
height. If any lighting is required solely because of the height of the facility,
the applicant must demonstrate that it has or will request the least visually
obtrusive marking and/or lighting scheme in the FAA applications.
Additionally, the Planning Commission, as part of site development plan
review, may review the plan to determine if the lighting requirement can be
eliminated by a reduced height or a change in location of the facility.
(b) Ground lighting. Emergency, safety or security ground lighting may be
utilized when there are people at the site. All ground lighting shall be
directed downward towards the facility, shielded and away from neighboring
properties.
(6) Bulk, height, and glare (Zoning Board of Adjustment). All wireless
communication facilities shall be designed in such a manner as to minimize the
visual impact of height, mass, and guy wire supports for the intended use.
Materials utilized for the exterior of any structure shall be of a type, style, and
location so as to minimize glare and not result in an adverse visual impact on any
historic or scenic view, public vantage point or from abutting properties.
(7) Finish (Zoning Board of Adjustment). New wireless communication facilities shall
have a galvanized finish unless otherwise required. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment, as part of conditional use review, may require the wireless
communication facility to be painted or otherwise camouflaged to minimize the
adverse visual impact.
(8) Fencing (Planning Commission). The area around the wireless communication
facility and communications equipment shall be completely fenced and gated for
security to a height of eight feet. Fencing shall be chosen so as to minimize visual
impact and be consistent with its intended safety purpose.
(9) Signs (Planning Commission). A sign no greater than six square feet stating the
name of the facility's owner and a twenty-four-hour emergency telephone number
shall be posted adjacent to the entry gate. In addition, "No Trespassing" or other
warning signs and the federal wireless communication facility registration plate,
where applicable, may be posted on the fence or as required to meet federal
requirements. No commercial signs or lettering shall be placed on the tower or
facility. This provision supersedes the Hartford Sign Ordinance.9
(10) Noise (Planning Commission). The Planning Commission may impose conditions
to minimize the effect of noise from the operation of machinery or equipment upon
adjacent properties and to ensure the standards of§ 260-31A.
(11) Collocation (Zoning Board of Adjustment).
(a) New wireless communication facilities shall be designed structurally,
electrically and in all respects to accommodate both the applicant's antenna,

additional antennas, and the rearrangement of antennas when the overall
permitted height allows. The owner of an approved facility shall allow other
providers to collocate on the facility subject to reasonable terms and
conditions. Notwithstanding, there shall be no affirmative obligation on the
owner to increase the height or width of the facility in order to accommodate
the equipment or facilities of another user.
(b) The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment that the new wireless communication facility cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved facility or structure due to one of
the following reasons:
[1] Structural or spatial capacity. The proposed antennas and equipment
would exceed the structural or spatial capacity of the existing or
approved facility, as documented by a structural engineer licensed to
practice in the State of Vermont. Additionally, the existing or approved
wireless communication facility cannot be reinforced, modified or
replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment, at a
reasonable cost, to provide coverage and capacity comparable to that of
the proposed facility.
[2] Radio frequency interference. The proposed antennas and equipment,
alone or together with existing facilities, equipment or antennas, would
create radio frequency interference (RFI) in violation of federal
standards or requirements as documented by a qualified radio frequency
engineer.
[3] Radio frequency radiation. The proposed antennas and equipment,
alone or together with existing facilities, equipment or antennas, would
create radio frequency radiation (RFR) in violation of federal standards
or requirements without unreasonable modification or mitigation
measures as documented by a qualified radio frequency engineer.
[4] Existing facilities. Existing wireless communication facilities cannot
accommodate, or be reasonably modified to accommodate, the planned
equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably or are too far
from the area of needed coverage to function reasonably as documented
by a qualified radio frequency engineer.
[5] Aesthetics. Aesthetic reasons make it unreasonable to locate the
planned equipment upon an existing or approved wireless
communication facility.
[6] Coverage. There are no existing or approved wireless communication
facilities in the area in which coverage is sought.
[7] Other. Other specific unforeseen reasons make it unreasonable to locate
the planned equipment upon an existing or approved wireless
communication. facility.

As provided for in Section 4414(1)(E) of the Act, provision is hereby made for establishment
of design review districts for any area containing structures of historical, architectural or
cultural merit, as well as areas with striking vistas, agricultural settlement patterns or other
significant landscape features. Within this designated district, all structures that are erected,
reconstructed, altered, restored, moved, or demolished, or land development that is
commenced must be in compliance with the design review sections detailed in these
regulations. A Design Review Committee (DRC) may be appointed by the Selectboard in
accordance with Section 4433 of the Act to advise the Planning Commission.
A Downtown White River Junction Design Review District.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this district is to recognize that White River Junction's
natural beauty and visual and historic character represent an important asset to the
Town, and contribute substantially to White River Junction's economic base. In
order to protect and enhance these attributes, the district is established to ensure
that development considers the existing architecture, site layout, streetscape design,
and sign placement and design. This design review is not intended to require
property owners to solely rehabilitate or replicate. Although reuse of existing
buildings is encouraged wherever possible, new construction is appropriate when
designed with sensitivity to the historic character and design features in the district.
Specific recommendations for development and redevelopment of the district are
made in the White River Junction Design Plan (2001) and White River Junction
Design Guidelines (2001), which are incorporated into the Zoning Regulations by
reference.
(2) Goals. The design goals of the Downtown White River Junction Design Review
District are as follows:
(a) To maintain a vibrant downtown, economically, functionally and culturally.
(b) To preserve and conserve the historic qualities of the downtown and retain a
sense of place.
(c) To ensure architectural and site enhancements and/or new development
projects preserve and/or enhance the historic qualities of downtown.
(d) To acknowledge and preserve the integrity of the built form of the
downtown, including landmarks, buildings and streetscape patterns.
(e) To support public and private sector design and development that is
compatible with the qualities of the downtown streetscape, townscape and
historic architecture.
(f) To educate the public on the value of preserving and enhancing the
downtown and the historic district.

§ 260-46 ZONING § 260-46
(g) To create suitable places for pedestrians.
(h) To accommodate parking with the least impact and encourage shared parking
where appropriate.
(3) District boundaries. The Downtown White River Junction Design Review District
shall consist of all lands designated on the White River Junction Design Review
District Boundary Map referenced in§ 260-12 of these Zoning Regulations.
(4) Uses. All uses that are currently permitted or conditionally permitted in the
underlying zoning district remain the same. All dimensional requirements from the
underlying zoning district, unless otherwise stated in the White River Junction
Design Guidelines, remain the same.
(5) Design review approval. Except as hereafter provided, no person shall do or cause
to be done any of the following acts with respect to any building located within the
Downtown White River Junction Design Review District without first obtaining
design review approval from the DRC, and design review approval from the
Planning Commission. If, after review by the DRC, the Committee determines that
the changes are minor and have no adverse effect related to the goals identified in
Subsection A(2), the DRC may recommend to the Planning Commission that the
proposed change be approved administratively in accordance with Subsection A(6).
(a) New construction, including, but not limited to, a building, wall, fence, or
other streetscape or site development activities on private and public land,
including in the right-of-way.
(b) Addition, alteration or restoration of the exterior of a building, including
windows, doorways, porches, roofing, siding and other materials when
different from those existing.

(a) If, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator and the Planning Commission
Chairperson with input from the DRC Chairperson, the following items are
determined to be minor and have no adverse effect related to the goals
identified in Subsection A(2), administrative design review approval may be
granted. Such improvements may include:
[1] Landscaping upgrades consistent with the guidelines;
[2] Routine maintenance or repair of any structure, as long as the
maintenance or repair does not result in any change of design, type of
material, or appearance of the structure or its appurtenances;
260:57 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-46 HARTFORD CODE § 260-46

§ 260-47. Planned development.
In accordance with Section 4417 of the Act, the Planning Commission may vary certain
regulations in order to encourage new communities, innovation in design and layout, more
efficient use of land and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of the open land in Town.
Approval for a planned development may be granted by the Planning Commission with the
approval of a subdivision plat. Approval of a planned development includes approval of a
major subdivision.
260:60 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-47 ZONING § 260-47
A. Proposals for planned development shall be submitted to the Planning Commission. The
material accompanying the proposal shall contain the following:
(1) The required site plan shall show all buildings, parking areas and landscaping at a
scale sufficient to permit the study of all elements of the plan. All utilities shall
also be shown and described. Typical elevations and floor plans of all buildings
may also be required. In addition, the site plans shall show the adjacent building
outlines and other outstanding features within 200 feet. Amendments to approved
site plans which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator and Planning
Commission Chairperson, are minor and have no adverse effect in terms of the
objectives stated in Subsection A(2) may be approved administratively upon filing
of the appropriate applications.
(2) A narrative master plan, the Official Development Plan, which shall state the
objective, uses (permitted and/or conditional as appropriate), area and dimension
standards, phasing, and any other land use standards appropriate to the planned
development· and necessary to meet the objectives and intent of the Hartford
Master Plan, Zoning Regulations, and the planned development.
B. The purpose (conditions) of a planned development shall be to encourage a development
which will result in:
(1) A choice in the types of environment and living units (where applicable) available
to the public, and quality in land uses so that development will be a permanent and
long-term asset to the Town.
(2) Open space and recreation areas if dwelling units are a part of the development.
(3) A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural topography
and geologic features and prevents soil erosion.
(4) An efficient use of land resulting in small networks of utilities and streets.
(5) An environment in harmony with surrounding development.
(6) A more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application
of other sections of these regulations.
C. Density may vary within the development. The Planning Commission may permit an
additional number of dwelling units in an area designated for residential use so long as
the total number of such dwelling units shall not exceed 125% of the permitted number
of units based on a calculation in conformance with strict application of the zone district
standards for area per family contained in the table of Article II for the district in which
the land is situated. This density bonus shall never be automatic, but shall be based on a
review by the Planning Commission that concludes that the developer's plan includes
design, innovative features, or facilities that satisfy the purposes listed in Subsection B
above.
D. The predominant use or impact of the land use shall not differ substantially from the uses
permitted in the district in which the plan is located. In a planned development, dwelling
units may be multifamily. In a planned development in a residential district, commercial
260:61 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-47 HARTFORD CODE § 260-48
educational and public facilities may be allowed which are designed to serve the
development and the area around the development.
E. Minimum area and dimension requirements may be waived; however, these will be
evaluated by the Planning Commission on their individual merit. Any changes which are
granted shall be noted on the plat.
F. A planned development shall comply with the following standards:
(1) Off-lot water and sewer may be required for over six dwelling units.
(2) At least 50% of the development shall be in open space for public and/or common
usage. The regulations for control and maintenance of this open space shall be
approved by the Planning Commission. This may be waived by the Planning
Commission for commercial and industrial planned developments, providing
adequate screening and landscaping are provided.
(3) The municipality may, at any time, accept the dedication of land or any interest in
land for public use and maintenance. The Planning Commission may require that
the applicant or landowner provide for and establish an organization or trust for the
ownership and maintenance of any common facilities or open space, and that this
organization or trust shall not be dissolved or revoked nor shall it dispose of any
common open space, by sale or otherwise, except to an organization or trust
conceived and established to own and maintain the common open space, without
first offering to dedicate the same to the municipality or other governmental
agency to maintain those common facilities or that open space.
G. The Planning Commission may prescribe, from time to time, rules and regulations to
supplement the standards and conditions set forth in these Zoning Regulations for
planned developments, provided the rules and regulations are not inconsistent with the
Zoning Regulations. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing after public
notice as required by Section 4464 of the Act prior to the establishment of any
supplementary rules and regulations for planned developments.
§ 260-48. Limitations on review authority.
The following uses may be regulated only with respect to location, size, height, building bulk,
yards, courts, setbacks, density of buildings, off-street parking, loading facilities, traffic, noise,
lighting, landscaping, and screening requirements and only to the extent that regulations do
not have the effect of interfering with the intended functional use:
A State- or community-owned and -operated institutions and facilities.
B. Public and private schools and other educational institutions certified by the State
Department of Education.
C. Churches and other places of worship, convents, and parish houses.
D. Public and private hospitals.
E. Regional solid waste management facilities certified under 10 V.S.A. Chapter 159.
260:62 11 - 01 - 2009
(
(
§ 260-48 ZONING § 260-50
F. Hazardous waste management facilities for which a notice of intent to construct has been
received under 10 V.S.A. § 6606a.
§ 260-49. Variances.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances as required by
§ 4469(a) of 24 V.S.A. Chapter 117. In granting a variance, the Board may impose conditions
it deems necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the purposes of
these regulations and the municipal plan currently in effect. The Board may grant a variance
and render a decision in favor of the appellant only if all of the following facts are found, and
the findings are specified in its written decision:
A. There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is
due to these conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of these regulations in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located;
B. Because of these physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of these regulations
and that the authorization of a variance is necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property;
C. The unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
D. The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy
resources, or be detrimental to the public welfare; and
E. The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum that will afford relief and will
represent the least deviation possible from these regulations and from the plan.
§ 260-50. Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment review process.
The annual list of application deadlines and public hearings for the Planning Commission and
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be available in December of each year. The schedule may
be amended by the Planning Commission or Zoning Board of Adjustment as necessary.
Regular meetings may be cancelled at any time by the Chair of the respective
Commission/Board. To the extent possible, applications requiring review by the Planning
Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment shall be scheduled to be heard during the same
application cycle. The Planning Commission and Zoning Board of Adjustment shall adopt
procedures for submission and review of said applications. The Planning Commission and
Zoning Board of Adjustment must issue a written decision within 45 days of the closing of
the public hearing. Failure to issue a decision within this period shall be deemed approval and
shall be effective on the 46th day.
260:63 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-51 HARTFORD CODE § 260-52
§ 260-51. Independent technical review.
The Planning Commission/Zoning Board of Adjustment/ Administrative Officer may obtain an
independent technical review of an application at the applicant's expense in accordance with
adopted policies/procedures. (The Hartford Selectboard adopted a policy on March 28, 2006,
outlining procedures and standards for assessment of technical review costs on zoning
applicants.)
§ 260-52. Setback waivers.
A. Purpose. The intent of this section is to provide flexibility in setback requirements for
the placement of primary and accessory structures in all zoning districts while
maintaining the character of the area.
B. Allowable waivers. One of the following conditions must exist in order for a waiver to
be considered, providing that a minimum setback of five feet is maintained. Waivers do
not apply to setbacks from surface waters, which must meet provisions set forth in
§ 260-25 of these regulations and the Hartford Flood Hazard Area Regulations.11 Such
waivers may be granted for new and complying existing structures by the Zoning Board
of Adjustment following a public hearing.
(1) When the reduction is no greater than the front or side setbacks for existing
structures on adjacent lots on the same street frontage.
(2) For greater fire safety as recommended by the Hartford Fire Department.
(3) For greater preservation of open land/agricultural land or scenic vistas.
(4) For greater preservation of other natural resources, such as, but not limited to,
surface waters, wetlands or steep slopes.
(5) For increased energy conservation and renewable energy structures.
(6) The waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum necessary to achieve the
stated purpose of this section.
C. Application procedures. Applications shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of
Adjustment for review and consideration at a public hearing in accordance with Section
4414(3) of the Act and the Town's application procedures and schedule.
D. Approval criteria. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall determine that, in issuing the
setback waiver, the proposed development will:
(1) Be compatible with the scale and design of structures and overall existing
development pattern of the surrounding area.
(2) Not impair reasonable or appropriate use of adjoining properties.
(3) Not result in greater impacts on natural resources.
11. Editor's Note: See Ch. 58, Flood Hazard Area Regulations.

ARTICLE V
Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots
§ 260-53. Applicability; word usage.
The following provisions shall apply to all uses, structures, and lots lawfully existing on
March 1, 1962, which do not conform to the requirements set forth in these regulations, and to
all uses, structures, and lots established after March 1, 1962, that, although conforming to the
Zoning Regulations at the time of their establishment, no longer conform by reason of
amendments to the regulations. (The words "use" and "structure" in this article shall refer to
both the principal and accessory uses and structures on a lot.)
§ 260-54. Nonconforming uses.
A Continuation of a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use may be continued
indefinitely, but may not be changed, resumed after discontinuance, or expanded except
as provided below.
B. Change of a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use, providing that the new nonconforming use, in the opinion of the
Zoning Board, does not increase the adverse effect on the surrounding area. Conditional
use approval and site development plan approval shall also be required.
C. Resumption of a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use which has been
discontinued will be governed by the following regulations:
(1) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of up to 180 days
may be resumed without Zoning Board or Planning Commission approval.
(2) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of 181 days or
longer shall not be resumed unless a permit for extension has been obtained from
the Administrative Officer prior to the expiration of the first 180 days. The first
260:65 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-54 HARTFORD CODE § 260-54
permit for extension shall be effective for one year from the date of issue, and up
to three six-month renewals may be issued so long as application for each renewal
is made prior to the expiration of the prior renewal. The maximum time from date
of discontinuance of the nonconforming use to expiration of all extensions shall be
three years.
(3) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of between 181
days and three years may be resumed only if the permits required in Subsection
C(2) have been obtained and the Zoning Board finds that the resumed
nonconforming use will not adversely affect the surrounding area. Conditional use
approval and site development plan approval shall also be required.
( 4) A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for three years or more, or for
which the permits required under Subsection C(2) have been allowed to expire,
shall not be resumed, nor shall it be replaced with another nonconforming use.
(5) A nonconforming use which has been changed to a conforming use shall not be
resumed.
(6) The intent to resume a nonconforming use shall not confer the right to do so.
(7) A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued if substantial operation of
the nonconforming use of the lot or structures on the lot has not occurred for a
continuous period of time. In considering whether or not a nonconforming use has
been discontinued, the Zoning Board shall make findings about some or all of the
following factors:
(a) Whether physical changes have been made on the lot or to a structure or sign
on the lot.
(b) Whether machinery and equipment customarily used to perform the
nonconforming use have been removed from the lot.
(c) Whether there has been a change of customary business practices.
(d) Whether revenues have been received .and expenses incurred during the
period of discontinuance and, if so, to what extent and for what use.
(e) Whether a lease (or a sale) of the lot for a use different from the
nonconforming use has occurred.
(f) Whether licenses or other permits necessary to perform the nonconforming
use have been renewed and whether insurance coverage has been renewed.
(g) Whether any performance of the nonconforming use that has occurred has
been merely of a token extent.
(h) Whether there has been a decrease or termination in the use of utilities, such
as water, wastewater, telephone, heating fuel, solid waste disposal, and
electrical usage.
260:66 11 - 01 - 2009
(
(
§ 260-54 ZONING § 260-55
(i) Whether the nonconforming use, if formerly "open to the public," has
continued to be "open to the public."
(j) Whether the lot, and structures, machinery, and equipment on the lot have
received normal maintenance.
(k) Whether there has been a decrease in traffic to and from the lot.
(1) Whether the personnel who perform the use have been present on the lot.
(m) Whether what may appear to be discontinuance is in fact a shutdown for
repairs or renovations.
(n) Whether discontinuance is the result of an inability to locate a tenant to
continue the nonconforming use in spite of a diligent search to find such a
tenant.
D. Expansion of a nonconforming use. The Zoning Board may allow the expansion of any
nonconforming use on a lot or within a structure on a lot up to 20% greater than its
existing size at the time it became a nonconforming use, provided that such expansion
does not adversely affect the surrounding area. Conditional use approval and site
development plan approval shall also be required. Single- and two-family dwellings
which are nonconforming uses may expand without Planning Commission or Zoning
Board Approval.
§ 260-55. Noncomplying structures.
A. Continuation of a noncomplying structure. Any noncomplying structure may be
continued indefinitely, but may not be expanded, or repaired or reconstructed after
destruction or damage, except as provided below.
B. Expansion of a noncomplying structure.
(1) A noncomplying structure may be expanded only in conformity with the
dimensional requirements of the Zoning Regulations unless a variance or setback
waiver from those dimensional requirements is obtained from the Zoning Board of
Adjustment. A variance or setback waiver may be granted in accordance with
§ 260-49 or 260-52.
(2) Single- and two-family dwellings and their accessory structures which already exist
within the setback area for a lot may be expanded without the necessity for a
variance or setback waiver, providing:
(a) The expansion comes no closer to the lot line than the existing structure;
(b) The height of the addition does not exceed the maximum height normally
allowed; and
(c) The length of the side of the structure extending into the setback shall not
exceed 20% of the original length of the noncomplying structure. This
expansion shall only be allowed once without a variance or setback waiver.
260:67 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-55 HARTFORD CODE § 260-56
C. Repair or reconstruction of a noncomplying structure. A noncomplying structure
which has been destroyed or damaged by a fire, explosion or other catastrophe may be
repaired or reconstructed within the same footprint, but only if such repair or
reconstruction is commenced within two years and completed within three years of such
destruction or damage.
D. Normal maintenance and repair of a noncomplying structure. Nothing in this section
shall be deemed to prevent the structural alteration or repair, the substantial rehabilitation
or remodeling, or the normal maintenance of a noncomplying structure, provided that
such action does not have t.he effect of increasing the degree of noncompliance.
§ 260-56. Adverse effect.
In considering whether or not a change, resumption, or expansion of a nonconforming use will
adversely affect the surrounding area, the Zoning Board shall make findings about some or all
of the following factors:
A. The history of use of the lot.
B. The size and location of adjoining and neighboring lots.
C. The uses made, or which have received zoning permits to be made, of adjoining lots and
the impact of the proposal on those uses.
D. The location of existing and proposed structures on the lot and the relation of those
structures to those on adjoining lots and to the dimensional requirements of the Zoning
Regulations.
E. The objective of the zoning district in which the lot and adjoining lots are located as
defined in§ 260-20 of the Zoning Regulations.
F. The suitability of the proposed expanded use to the character of the neighborhood.
G. Whether an increase in business hours or a change in hours from daytime to nighttime
will result and the effect of such an increase or change on adjoining uses and the
neighborhood.
H. Whether the proposed use will result in an increase in noise, fumes, dust, or odors.
I. Whether greater volumes of vehicular traffic will be generated and what impact this
greater volume of traffic will have on the use of adjoining lots, on the neighborhood, and
on pedestrian and vehicular safety.
J. Whether there will be an increase in the number of employees.
K. Whether there will be an increase in outdoor activity or outdoor storage.
L. Whether there is adequate off-street parking as required by the Zoning Regulations.

§ 260-59. Terms defined.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT - An efficiency or one-bedroom apartment, located
within or appurtenant to a single-family dwelling, that is clearly subordinate to a single-family
dwelling, and has facilities and provisions for independent living, including sleeping, food
preparation, and sanitation, provided there is compliance with all the following:
A. The owner of the single-family dwelling occupies either the primary dwelling or

B. The property has sufficient wastewater capacity.
C. The unit does not exceed 30% of the total habitable floor area of the single-family
dwelling.
D. Applicable setback, coverage, and parking requirements specified in these regulations are
met.
260:69 11 - 01 - 2009
§ 260-59 HARTFORD CODE § 260-59
ACCESSORY PRODUCT - A product that is incidental and subordinate to the overall
service performed by the commercial activity, i.e. the sale of shampoo at a barber shop or
beauty salon.
ACCESS RAMP - A structure built on the outside of a building to allow direct entry to the
building by persons in wheelchairs.
ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE A use or structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.
ADEQUATE CAPACITY (provider's capacity for wireless telephony) . When the grade of
service ("GOS") is p.05 or better for median teletraffic levels offered during the typical busy
hour, as assessed by direct measurement of the facility in question. The GOS shall be
determined by the use of standard Erlang B calculations. As call blocking may occur in either
the land line or radio portions of a wireless network, adequate capacity for this regulation
shall apply only to the capacity of the radio components. When determined prior to the
installation of the personal wireless services facility in question, adequate capacity shall be
determined on the basis of a 20% busy hour (20% of all offered traffic occurring within the
busiest hour of the day), with total daily traffic based on aggregate estimates of the expected
traffic in the coverage area.
ADEQUATE COVERAGE A provider's coverage for wireless telephony is "adequate"
within that area surrounding a base station where the predicted or measured median field
strength of the transmitted signal is such that most of the time transceivers properly installed
and operated will be able to communicate with the base station without objectionable noise
(or excessive-bit-error-rate for digital) and without calls being dropped. In the case of cellular
communications in a rural environment, this would be a signal strength of at least -90 dBm. It
is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage as long as the signal
regains its strength further away from the base station. The outer boundary of the area of
adequate coverage, however, is that location past which the signal does not regain.
