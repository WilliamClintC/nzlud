SECTION 9-10-1   FINDINGS OF FACT
The flood hazard areas of Pleasant Grove are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection
and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to
other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
SECTION 9-10-2    STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects:
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally
            undertaken at the expense of the general public:
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions:
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric,
            telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone                          areas in such a manner as
to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
SECTION 9-10-3  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property
in times of
flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities:
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction:
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers    which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage;
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
SECTION 9-10-4    DEFINITIONS
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance
shall be interpreted to
give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its
most reasonable
application.
 
ALLUVIAL FAN FLOODING - means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial
fan or
similar landform, which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-
velocity flows: active
processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable
flow paths.
 
APEX - means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the
flow path of the
major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan
flooding can occur.
 
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING - means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or
greater annual
chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly
defined channel does
not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may be evident.
Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
 
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD - is the land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The
area may be
designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed
ratemaking
has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually
is refined into
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.
 
BASE FLOOD - means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in
any given year.
 
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) is the water surface elevation of the 1-percent-
annual-chance flood event.  It is the height in relation to mean sea level
expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in
the floodplains of coastal and riverine areas. It is also the elevation shown
on the FIRM and found in the accompanying Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Zones
A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation
resulting from the flood that has a 1-percent chance of equaling or exceeding
that level in any given year.
 
BASEMENT - means any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below
ground level) on
all sides.
 
CRITICAL FEATURE - means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood
protection
system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would
be
compromised.
 
DEVELOPMENT - means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
 
ELEVATED BUILDING - means a non-basement building (i) built, in the case of a
building in
Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the

the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the
lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings,
columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and
(ii) adequately
anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a
flood of up to the
magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B,
C, X, and D,
"elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid
foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement
of flood waters.
In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a
building otherwise
meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is
enclosed by means of
breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5)
of the National
Flood Insurance Program regulations.
 
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION - means for the purposes of determining rates, structures
for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before
January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction"
may also be
referred to as "existing structures."
 
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION - means a manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which
the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities,
the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations
adopted by a
community.
 
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION –means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads).
 
FLOOD OR FLOODING - means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
 
(1) the overflow of inland or tidal waters.
the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
 
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM) - means an official map of a community,
issued by the Administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow) related
erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as Zones A, M, and/or

preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.
 
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS - means zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances
(such as a floodplain
ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other
applications of police
power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which
provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.
 
FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM - means those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically
to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a
community subject to a
"special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding.
Such a system
typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes.
These specialized
flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound
engineering standards.
 
FLOOD PROOFING - means any combination of structural and non-structural
additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or
improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their

    preservation programs that have been certified either:
 
By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or;
 
(2) Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
LEVEE - means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and
constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control,
or divert the flow
of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding.
 
LEVEE SYSTEM - means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and
associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are
constructed and operated
in accordance with sound engineering practices.
 
LOWEST FLOOR - means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement).
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or
vehicles, building access
or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's
lowest floor;
provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National
Flood insurance
Program regulations.
 
MANUFACTURED HOME - means a structure transportable in one or more sections,
which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation
when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not
include a
"recreational vehicle".
 
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION - means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or
sale.
 
MEAN SEA LEVEL - means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program,

flood
elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
 
NEW CONSTRUCTION - means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates,
structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of
an initial FIRM or
after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such
structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means
structures for which
the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a
floodplain management
regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to
such
structures.
 
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION - means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the
manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation
of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed
on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by
a community.
 
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE - means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis;
(ii) 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii)
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
(iv) designed primarily not for use as
a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
 
START OF CONSTRUCTION - (for other than new construction or substantial
improvements
under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial
improvement and
means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was
within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
prep aeration,
such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part
of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
 
STRUCTURE - means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank, that
is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50 percent
of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
 
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT - means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market
value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This
includes structures
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The
term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a
structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications, which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary
conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
 
VARIANCE - is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this
ordinance when
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance,
therefore, permits
construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance.
(For full
requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations.)
 
VIOLATION - means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with
the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other
development without
the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
compliance required in Section
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to
be in violation until such
time as that documentation is provided.
 
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION - means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
 
SECTION 9-10-5  APPLICABILITY
 
The ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of Pleasant Grove City.
 
SECTION 9-10-6   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD
 
Since areas of special flood hazard have not been identified, water surface
elevations have not been provided, nor has sufficient data identifying the
floodway been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA), the
community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize data available from
other Federal, State or other sources.
 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled, The Flood
Insurance Study for Utah County, dated June, 19, 2020 and accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any
revisions thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of
this ordinance.
 
SECTION 9-10-7   COMPLIANCE
 
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use
changed without full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
 
SECTION 9-10-8   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
 
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants,
or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance,
easement, covenant,
or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall
prevail.
 
SECTION 9-10-9   INTERPRETATION
 
In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall
be; (1) considered as
minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body;
and (3) deemed
neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes
 
SECTION 9-10-10   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare
occasions greater
floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes.
This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
ordinance shall
not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee
thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made
there under.
 
SECTION 9-10-11   DESIGNATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR

      requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
 
(2) The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it
is alleged
      there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Floodplain
      Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
 
(3) Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may
appeal such
      decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
 
(4) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal
      and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
 
(5) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures
      listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory
of Historic Places,
      without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this
ordinance.
 
(6) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements
to be
      erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with            existing structures constructed below the
base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section C of this Article
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
 
(7) Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
ordinance, the
    Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it
deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance
(Article 1, Section C).
 
(8) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood
      levels during the base flood discharge would result.
 
(9)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's  continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
 
(10)    Prerequisites for granting variances:
a. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
 
b. Variances shall only be issued upon, (i) showing a good and sufficient
cause; (ii) a
determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
 
c. Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
that
the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation
below the base    flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
 
(11) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally    dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in
Section 9-10-14 Subsections 1- 9 are met, and (ii) the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

8-6-7: LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT:
8-6-7 -8: PENALTY:
8-6-1: FINDINGS; STORM DRAINAGE MASTER PLAN ADOPTED:
The city council:
A. Has found it necessary and determined that the public interest, convenience,
health, welfare and safety requires that all water generated from, off and
around individual construction, commercial, industrial, and public use
developments and subdivisions be confined and disposed of in a flood control
storm drain system; and (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998)
B. Has adopted as part of the city's general plan a storm drainage master plan
as amended from time to time relating to the disposition of surface waters in a
storm drainage system; and (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998; amd. Ord. 2004-16, 7-20-
2004)
C. Has found that each area which is proposed to be subdivided, developed and/
or built upon, does in fact generate additional runoff water which needs to be
disposed of in a safe manner, avoiding damage and hazards to the inhabitants of
the city; and
D. Has found it is necessary that certain improvements be constructed upon and/
or in close proximity to subdivisions, commercial, industrial and public use
developments, developments and individual construction in order to carry the
surface runoff water to appropriate storage, disposition areas and other
facilities identified in the storm drainage master plan; and
E. Has found that the costs of construction of the improvements must be borne
by the subdivision and/or proposed developer and builder. (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-
1998)
8-6-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and their
derivations shall have the meanings given herein:
CATCH BASIN: A basin that has a storm water inlet to trap solids or debris.
DEBRIS: Any rock, dirt, sand, tree or other rubbish, litter, etc.
DETENTION BASIN OR RETENTION BASIN: A depression, or bermed area, designed with
an inlet and outlet that regulates water flow and may allow debris to settle
out of the water, and that is capable of detaining storm water runoff until it
can either percolate into the surrounding soil, or be discharged at an approved
release rate into a channel, pipe, ditch, street or other conveyance, without
causing damage downstream. The detention basin shall have a discharge into said
facilities as set forth above, however, a retention basin must contain all
generated volumes.
DRAIN INLET: A point of entry into a sump, detention or retention basin, or
storm water system or conduit, or approved irrigation system.
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID): Storm water control measures intended to capture,
infiltrate, or treat initial runoff.
STORM DRAIN: A closed conduit for conducting storm water that has been
collected by inlets or other approved means.
STORM WATER: Precipitation such as rain, snow, hail or other naturally
occurring waters, that are not present as groundwater. Once the water
percolates into the soil, it is defined herein as groundwater. Storm water
runoff is water that is generated by storm water over land. All other water is
defined as being water that is naturally occurring, and is not storm water.
SUMP: A formalized structure underground, surrounded by drain rock, that acts
as a detention basin to allow the slow release of water into the surrounding
subsoil. Sumps usually receive storm water runoff from paved areas such as
streets, parking lots, building roofs, etc. (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998)
8-6-5: REDUCTION OF STORM WATER FLOWS:
A. The development for which the permit or approval is issued must design for
and calculate the flows and volume, as provided in subsection 11-7-4D of this
code, that will be produced by a 10-year, 24-hour storm for detained flow and
storage, and a 25-year, 24-hour storm for retained flow and storage. In
addition, the maximum allowable discharge from the entire project area or site
shall not exceed 0.15 cfs per acre of gross area of development. The amount of
storm water exiting the project cannot exceed the amount calculated above, but
may be further restricted by the capacity of existing storm drains or drainage
facilities as determined by the city engineer. Restrictions to the controlled
rate of release will require that detention storage be provided. If no storm
water collection, irrigation system with allowable capacity, or detention
basins downstream are available, with sufficient unused capacity for the 10-
year storm volume, or any portion thereof, retention of the 25-year storm must
be provided. In any event that retention is the only available source of storm
water management, in the determination of the city engineer, the soil must be
capable of absorbing the entire volume of water within a three (3) day period
of time, as determined by a percolation test that shall be performed on the
site to be used for retention of the storm water. All other provisions of the
sizing, improvement and use of retention or detention basins shall conform in
all instances to the provisions of section 10-15-33 of this code. In addition,
all provisions of the design of storm water systems or control for each
development shall conform to the master storm water management plan.
B. After July 7, 2020, all submitted development plans greater than 1 acre in
size must address Low Impact Development storm drain design practices as
outlined below. The Project Volume Retention Goal (V goal ) must be calculated
as described in the “Storm Water Technical Manual” in Appendix A of the “Public
Works Standards Specifications and Drawings”.
For developments in single family residential zones, the MS4 LID Residential
Development Fee will be calculated based on the V goal volume, in accordance
with the current adopted fee schedule.
All other types of development must provide infiltration, evapotranspiration
and bioretention facilities for the full V goal volume in accordance with the
requirements of the Storm Water Technical Manual. If conditions exist as
outlined in the Storm Water Technical Manual that prevent such developments
from infiltrating the full volume, a partial retention approach shall be
utilized. Whatever volume of water cannot be infiltrated shall be treated using
LID practices prior to discharging any storm water offsite.
C . B. In the instances where the plan describes major storm water conveyance
channels that are intended to remain in an open, non-piped condition,
conflicting provisions of this code, requiring that channels, ditches, and
other storm or irrigation water conveyances be piped, shall be waived. (Ord.
98-34, 12-15-1998)
8-6-6: PIPING OF EXISTING DRAINAGE/IRRIGATION FACILITIES:
Any open irrigation and/or drainage ditches which are located within or along
the borders of any proposed development must be piped or otherwise covered as a
condition of development approval, except as provided in section 8-6-5 of this
chapter. The developer shall be responsible for the design and construction of
the required improvements. In the event the ditch has been identified in the
storm drainage master plan as needing increased capacity, the city council may
elect to have the city participate in the costs of piping such ditch. (Ord. 98-
34, 12-15-1998)
11-7-4: PRELIMINARY PLAT:
D.  Drainage Plan: Preliminary drainage plan, in accordance with title 8,
chapter 6 of this Code, by which the subdivider proposes to detain the storm
water runoff from a 10-year storm and meet Low Impact Development design
requirementsas described in title 8, chapter 6 and title 11, chapter 7 of this
Code. The presence of storm water which flows onto the subdivided area and
ultimate disposal of the storm water leaving the subdivided area must be
considered. The subdivider is responsible for controlling storm runoff
throughout all stages of construction of the development improvements.
Facilities capable of conveying peak runoff from a 10-year storm to a point of
on site or approved off site detention or retention is required. Detention or
retention must be provided to limit the discharge into downstream drainage
facilities to historical flows off of the property, as provided in title 8,
chapter 6 of this Code. Written permission by the irrigation company board must
be presented indicating the irrigation company's approval to discharge storm
water into any irrigation company owned ditch; or any ditch or other facility
which discharges into an irrigation company owned ditch farther downstream.
Storm water inundation areas around any natural water courses in the vicinity
for a 100-year storm must be identified. Construction of buildings shall not be
permitted in these areas.
11-7-5: FINAL PLAT:
E.  Supplementary Documents And Submissions: The following documents shall be
submitted with the final drawing and shall be considered part of the final plat
submission:
      4.  Final drainage plan, in accordance with title 8, chapter 6 of this
code, by which the subdivider proposes to detain the storm water runoff from a
10-year storm and meet Low Impact Development design requirements as described
in title 8, chapter 6 and title 11, chapter 7 of this Code . The presence of
storm water which flows onto the subdivided area and ultimate disposal of the
storm water leaving the subdivided area must be considered. The subdivider is
responsible for controlling storm runoff throughout all stages of construction
of the development improvements. Facilities capable of conveying peak runoff
from a 10-year storm to a point of on site or approved off site detention or
retention is required. Detention or retention must be provided to limit the
discharge into downstream drainage facilities to historical flows off of the
property, as provided in title 8, chapter 6 of this code. Written permission by
the Pleasant Grove irrigation company board must be presented indicating the
irrigation company's approval to discharge storm water into any irrigation
company owned ditch; or any ditch or other facility which discharges into an
irrigation company owned ditch farther downstream. Storm water inundation areas
around any natural watercourses in the vicinity for a 100-year storm must be
identified. Construction of buildings shall not be permitted in these areas.

There is an underlying policy in the city strongly favoring the careful
consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to
the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty
and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same
time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property
must be preserved and the public's right to require the dedication or exaction
of property consistent with the constitution. Consistent with this policy, it
is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may
involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist
city government in considering decisions that may involve constitutional
takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well
as guidelines for such considerations. This chapter is further intended and
shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a
specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet
preserve the ability of the city to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill
its other duties and functions. (Ord. 95-5, 2-21-1995)

      3.   Any recent court rulings governing the physical taking or exaction
of private real property by a government entity.
   B.   Actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of
private real property is not a constitutional taking if the physical taking or
exaction:
      1.   Bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest; and
      2.   Is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an

seek assistance from the historic preservation commission in applying for
grants or tax credits for rehabilitating their properties.
      4.   Review Of Exterior Work By Commission: Proposed exterior work on
historic landmarks is subject to the review and approval of the historic
preservation commission. The purpose of this review is to ensure the
preservation of historic properties to the greatest degree possible. This
review applies to individually designated landmark properties or any property,
contributing or noncontributing, located in a landmark designated historic
district. This review applies only to exterior work which requires a building
permit, sign permit or demolition permit.
         a.   Applications for building, demolition or sign permits pertaining
to historic landmarks shall be forwarded by the community development
department to the historic preservation commission prior to their issuance.
         b.   A permit applicant, in order to obtain a permit from the
community development department, shall file a request for a certificate of
appropriateness with the commission on a form furnished by the commission.
         c.   At its next scheduled meeting, the commission shall review the
application and proposed work for compliance with the standards for
rehabilitation, hereafter referred to as the "standards", and any design
guidelines adopted by the commission and city council.
         d.   Applicants whose proposed projects comply with the provisions of
this article shall be issued a certificate of historic appropriateness within
ten (10) days, which authorizes the issuance of the appropriate permit.
            (1)   Applicants whose proposed projects are found to be in
noncompliance with this article shall be offered a negotiating period of sixty
(60) days, during which time the commission and applicant shall explore all
options for an acceptable solution. These may include the feasibility of
modifying the plans, using the historic landmark for alternative purposes, and
reselling the property to another party. The commission may extend the
negotiating period an additional sixty (60) days for the purposes described
above if deemed necessary to accommodate a potential solution.
            (2)   If no solution has been agreed upon at the conclusion of
either the initial sixty (60) day period or the full one hundred twenty (120)
day period, the certificate of historic appropriateness will be denied;
consequently, the building official shall not issue any permits.
      5.   Claims Of Economic Hardship; Criteria:
         a.   The commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness for
rehabilitation or demolition of a landmark property if the owner has presented
substantial evidence demonstrating that unreasonable economic hardship will
result from denial of the certificate of appropriateness.
         b.   In order to sustain a claim of unreasonable economic hardship,
the commission may require the owner to provide information regarding the
property's ability to produce a reasonable return for the owner.
         c.   Demonstration of economic hardship by the owner shall not be
based on conditions resulting from wilful or negligent acts by the owner,
purchasing the property for substantially more than market value at the time of
purchase, failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs, failure to
diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant
improvements.
      6.   Appeal: An applicant who has been denied any permit by the building
official, based on the commission's refusal to issue a certificate of historic
appropriateness, may appeal that decision to the city council. The appeal must
be made on or before thirty (30) days after the commission's decision.
   E.   Removal Of Properties From Register: Properties which, in the opinion
of the historic preservation commission, no longer meet the criteria for
eligibility may be removed from the historic landmark register by the city
council after recommendation of the commission.
   F.   Enforcement: The provisions of this section are subject to the
enforcement provisions established in the international building code, as
adopted by the city. (Ord. 2002-5, 2-5-2002; amd. 2003 Code)

2-2C-10: STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION AND DESIGN GUIDELINES:
The following standards and guidelines shall be used by the historic
preservation commission in determining the historic appropriateness of any
application pertaining to historic landmark properties. This includes
individually designated landmark properties and both contributing and
noncontributing properties in landmark designated historic districts. In
approving an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the historic
preservation commission shall find that the project substantially complies with
all of the following standards and guidelines that pertain to the application
and that the decision is in the best interest of the city.
   A.   Standards For Rehabilitation: These standards are based on the
secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation, which serves as a
national and state model for appropriate preservation treatment. The standards
are as follows:
      1.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      2.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      3.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings,
shall not be undertaken.
      4.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      5.   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
      6.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence.
      7.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      8.   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      9.   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      10.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
For further details, see the secretary of the interior's standards for
rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings (1990 or
current version).
   B.   Design Guidelines: Additional design recommendations and guidelines
adopted by the commission and city council shall also be used in reviewing
applications for certificates of historic appropriateness. (Ord. 2002-5, 2-5-
2002)

   A.   Authority: Any person or entity desiring a waiver or modification of
the requirements of the City's land use ordinances as applied to a parcel of
property that he owns, leases, or in which he holds some other beneficial
interest, may apply to the Hearings Officer for a variance from the terms of
such ordinances.
   B.   Conditions: The Hearings Officer may grant a variance only if:
      1.   Literal enforcement of the City's land use ordinances would cause an
unreasonable hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the
general purpose of such ordinances;
      2.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not
generally apply to other properties in the same district;
      3.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a substantial
property right possessed by other property in the same district;
      4.   The variance will not substantially affect the General Plan and will
not be contrary to the public interest; and
      5.   The spirit of the City's land use ordinances is observed and
substantial justice done.
   C.   Unreasonable Hardship:
      1.   In determining whether enforcement of the land use ordinances would
cause unreasonable hardship under subsection B1 of this section, the Hearings
Officer may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged hardship:
         a.   Is located on or associated with the property for which the
variance is sought; and
         b.   Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood.
      2.   In determining whether enforcement of the City's land use ordinances
would cause unreasonable hardship as outlined under subsection B1 of this
section, the Hearings Officer may not find an unreasonable hardship if the
hardship is self-imposed or economic.
   D.   Special Circumstances: In determining whether there are special
circumstances attached to the property under subsection B2 of this section, the
Hearings Officer may find that special circumstances exist only if special
circumstances:
      1.   Relate to the hardship complained of; and
      2.   Deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties in
the same district.
   E.   Burden Of Proof: The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that
all of the conditions justifying a variance have been met.
   F.   Run With Land: Variances run with the land.
   G.   Use Variances Prohibited: The Hearings Officer may not grant use
variances.
   H.   Additional Requirements: In granting a variance, the Hearings Officer
may impose additional requirements on the applicant that will:
      1.   Mitigate any harmful effects of the variance; or
      2.   Serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived or
modified. (Ord. 2017-29, 5-16-2017)
2-4-6: NONCONFORMING USES:
The Hearings Officer may make determinations regarding the existence, expansion
or modification of nonconforming uses. (Ord. 2017-29, 5-16-2017)
2-4-7: SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Disability Special Exception:
      1.   Although the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) applies only to:
a) employment, b) public services, c) public accommodation, and d)
telecommunications, and thus does not apply to private residences or private
property there is often a circumstance where an individual may require some
special adaptation to their home or personal surroundings to accommodate their
disability. Such adaptation might not be provided for in the land use
ordinance. In such a case the definition of "disabled" as contained in the ADA
shall be applied to the individual by the Hearings Officer and if applicable
the Hearings Officer may grant a variance under this special exception
subsection. That definition is as follows and is to be considered a standard
for applying this special exception: An individual is "disabled" if he or she
meets at least any one of the following tests:
         a.   He or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially
limits one or more of his/her major life activities;
         b.   He or she has a record of such an impairment; or
         c.   He or she is regarded as having such an impairment.
      2.   The Hearings Officer may request that the medical hardship/
disability be documented by a licensed physician; and depending upon this
medical assessment the Hearings Officer may request a periodic review of this
assessment.
      3.   Variances normally run with the land. In cases where the variance
results from a granted medical hardship special exception, that variance can
run with either or both land and the requesting individual(s) as determined by
the Hearings Officer.
      4.   In cases where the medical hardship special exception variance will
run with the individual and not the land, the variance cannot be transferred to
another location without a reapplication for the special exception.
      5.   The Hearings Officer shall impose conditions as it deems necessary
on the granted medical hardship special exception variance that will mitigate
any harmful effects of the variance or serve the purpose of the standard or
requirement that is waived or modified.
   B.   Historical Property Special Exceptions:
      1.   Historically, many parcels within the older sections of Pleasant
Grove City were developed with deep, narrow parcels. An increasing number of
the owners of those deep, narrow parcels elect to subdivide their parcels by
defining one or more building lots (normally flag lots) behind their existing
home. In many cases there is adequate area to build because of the depth of the
parcel, but the deficiency in the width of the parcel or the location of the
existing home does not allow for either the designated flag stem road width or
the required setback from the existing home, or both.
      2.   A historical property special exceptions variance is hereby
established and may be used at the discretion of the Hearings Officer for
mitigating the zoning requirements of existing previously developed historical
properties. The following standards shall apply:
         a.   A property is considered "historical" if it was established on
the tax rolls, with a residential dwelling on a legally subdivided parcel,
prior to August 20, 1985.
         b.   This historical property special exceptions variance may be
granted if the requested variances do not change the requirement of the zone by
more than twenty percent (20%). No reduction in lot size or property line
setbacks are allowed.
         c.   In the event multiple variances are being requested to qualify a
given lot for a building permit the Hearings Officer is authorized to apply
this historical property special exceptions variance to no more than one of the
requests. The other requests must qualify under the terms of Utah Code
Annotated.
      3.   The Hearings Officer shall impose conditions as he/she deems
necessary on the granted historical property special exceptions variance to
mitigate any harmful effects of the variance or to serve the purpose of the
standard or requirement that is waived or modified. (Ord. 2017-29, 5-16-2017)

3-15-1: PURPOSE:
Residents of the city have an inalienable interest in their personal safety,
well being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to
provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political
or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The city
has a substantial interest in protecting the well being, tranquility, personal
safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect
citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The city also has
a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair
consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.
There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the city and its
citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this chapter on the rights of
those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of city officials
derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from
criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door to
door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those
affected by door to door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial
decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and
denied persons seeking to engage in door to door solicitation, the city adopts
this chapter to promote the city's substantial interests in: respecting
citizens' decisions regarding privacy in their residences; protecting persons
from criminal conduct; providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against
religious belief, political position, or charitable activities; and permitting
truthful and nonmisleading door to door solicitation regarding lawful goods or
services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
The city finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this
chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the city interests
referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those
regulated. (Ord. 2007-13, 3-20-2007)
3-15-2: NO OTHER CITY LICENSE OR APPROVAL REQUIRED:

uses employees, independent contractors, or agents for door to door
solicitation in an effort to provide any tangible or intangible benefit to the
business, shall be required to have such solicitors obtain a certificate,
unless otherwise exempt from registration.
   C.   Those responsible persons or entities associated with registered
solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or
registration from the city, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed
place of business in the city.
   D.   Nothing herein is intended to interfere with or supplant any other
requirement of federal, state, or other local government law regarding any
license, permit, or certificate that a registered solicitor is otherwise
required to have or maintain. (Ord. 2007-13, 3-20-2007)

the petition, and any decision to deny such petition shall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. (Ord. 2000-35,
9-19-2000)
3-17-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning
ascribed to them below:
ANTENNA: Any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio or television
communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves,
including equipment attached to a tower or building, for the purpose of
providing personal wireless services.
ANTENNA HEIGHT: The vertical distance measured from the base of the antenna
support structure at grade to the highest point of the structure, even if said
highest point is an antenna. Measurement of tower height shall include antenna,
base pad and other appurtenances and shall be measured from the finished grade
of the parcel. If the support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average
between the highest and lowest grades shall be used in calculating the antenna
height.
ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE: Any pole, telescoping mast, tower, tripod or other
structure which supports an antenna.
CELL SITE: A tract or parcel of land that contains the cellular communications
or personal wireless services antenna, its support structure, accessory
buildings and parking, and may include other uses associated with and ancillary
to cellular communications or personal wireless services transmission.
FAA: The federal aviation administration.
FCC: The federal communications commission.
GOVERNING AUTHORITY: The governing authority of the city, namely the city
council.
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE AND PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES: As used in
this chapter, shall be defined in the same manner as in United States Code
title 47, section 332(c)(7)(C), as may be amended now or in the future.
TOWER: Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose
of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers,
guy towers or multiple towers. The term encompasses personal wireless
facilities, including radio and television transmission towers, microwave
towers, common carrier towers, cellular telephone towers or personal
communications service towers, alternative tower structures, and the like.
TOWER (STEALTH): Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for
the purpose of supporting one or more antennas in a manner that shall be
camouflaged and constructed in a manner to avoid detection as a cell tower
(i.e., flagpole, tree, etc.). (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-3: POLICY STATEMENT:
The planning commission and city council have, on numerous occasions and with
increasing frequency, been confronted with requests to site communications
towers and antennas. The purpose of this chapter is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are
to: a) encourage the location of towers on public property and in
nonresidential areas and to minimize the total number of towers throughout the
city; b) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites; c)
encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible,
in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal; d) encourage users of
towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse
visual impact of the towers and antennas; and e) enhance the ability of the
providers of telecommunications services to provide such services throughout
the city quickly, effectively and efficiently. Accordingly, the city council
finds that the promulgation of this chapter is warranted and necessary to:
   A.   Manage the location of towers and antennas in the city and encourage
the use of public property for the placement thereof;
   B.   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers, including support structure failure and falling ice;
   C.   Minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design,
siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
   D.   Accommodate the growing need for towers;
   E.   Promote and encourage shared use/collocation of existing and new towers
as a primary option rather than construction of additional single use towers,
and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future;
   F.   Consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent allowed
by the telecommunications act of 1996; and
   G.   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna support
structure failure and falling ice, through engineering and proper siting of
antenna support structures. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-4: LICENSE REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any business of personal
wireless telecommunications facilities within the corporate limits of the city
without first obtaining a business license. (2003 Code)
3-17-5: WHERE PERMITTED:
Cell towers are a permitted use in any zone on city owned property and are
permitted as a conditional use in other zones on property owned by any other
entity. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-6: EXISTING TOWERS:
All towers existing on the date of passage of the ordinance codified herein
shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist. Routine
maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers. New construction, other
than routine maintenance on existing towers, shall comply with the requirements
of this chapter. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-7: INDUSTRY SITE SELECTION CRITERIA:
In selecting a new site, the industry requires a location that is technically
compatible with the established network. A general area is to be identified
based upon engineering constraints and the desired area of service. Specific
locations within that general area will be evaluated using the following
criteria, which are not listed in order of priority:
   A.   Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum
efficiency in telephone service.
   B.   Availability of road access.
   C.   Availability of electric power.
   D.   Availability of land based telephone lines or microwave link
capability.
   E.   Leasable lands, and landlords who want facilities to be located on
their properties consistent with zoning regulations.
   F.   Screening potential of existing vegetation, structures and topographic
features.
   G.   Zoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities.
   H.   Compatibility with adjacent land users.
   I.   The least number of sites to cover the desired area.
   J.   The greatest amount of coverage, consistent with physical requirements.
   K.   Opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact.
   L.   Availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting.
(Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-8: CITY SITE SELECTION CRITERIA:
   A.   Scope: As a fundamental element of this chapter, the telecommunications
company proposing to construct an antenna support structure or mount an antenna
on an existing structure is required to demonstrate, using technological
evidence, that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order to satisfy its
function in the company's grid system. Further, the company must demonstrate by
technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum height
necessary to fulfill the cell site's function within the grid system.
   B.   FCC Provider Or Agreements: Applications for necessary permits will
only be processed when the applicant demonstrates that it is either an FCC
licensed telecommunications provider or has in place agreements with an FCC
licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure.
   C.   Minimization Of Adverse Effect: Low power mobile radio service
facilities should be located and designed to minimize any adverse effects that
they may have on residential property values. Sites should be placed in
locations where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings or other
structures provide the greatest amount of screening.
   D.   Impact On Neighborhood; Minimum Lot Size: Location and design of sites
in all districts should consider the impact of the site on the surrounding
neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district. In residential
districts and residential land use areas, the minimum lot size for commercial
communications towers on nonpublic land shall be three (3) acres. (Ord. 2000-
35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-9: PRIORITIES:
   A.   Order Specified: The following establishes the order of priorities for
locating new communications facilities:
      1.   Place antennas and towers on city property in nonresidential zones.
      2.   Place antennas and towers on city property in the residential zones.
      3.   Place antennas on appropriate existing structures, such as
buildings, communications towers, water towers and smokestacks in other zoned
districts.
      4.   Place antennas and towers on other private nonresidential property.
      5.   Place antennas and stealth towers: a) only in other residential
districts only if locations for which a need has been demonstrated are not
available on existing structures or in nonresidential districts; and b) only on
or in existing churches, parks, schools, utility facilities or other public
facilities.
   B.   Location Considerations: An applicant for a new antenna support
structure to be located in a residential zoning district shall demonstrate that
a diligent effort has been made to locate the proposed communications
facilities on a government structure, a private institutional structure, or
other appropriate existing structures within a nonresidential zoning district,
and that due to valid considerations, including physical constraints and
economic or technological feasibility, no appropriate location is available.
The telecommunications company is required to demonstrate that it contacted the
owners of tall structures within a one mile radius of the site proposed, asked
for permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was denied for
reasons other than economic ones. The information submitted by the applicant
shall include a map of the area to be served by the tower, its relationship to
other antenna sites in the applicant's network, and an evaluation of existing
buildings taller than twenty feet (20'), communications towers and water tanks
within one mile of the proposed tower.
   C.   Priority Of Users: Priority for the use of city owned land for antennas
and towers will be given to the following entities in descending order:
      1.   The city;
      2.   Public safety agencies, including law enforcement, fire and
ambulance services, which are not part of the city and private entities with a
public safety agreement with the city;
      3.   Other governmental agencies, for uses which are not related to
public safety; and
      4.   Entities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication
services, including cellular, personal communication services (PCS),
specialized mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio (ESMR),
paging, and similar services marketed to the general public. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-
19-2000)
3-17-10: MINIMUM AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Minimum Requirements: The placement of antennas or towers on city owned
property must comply with the following requirements:
      1.   The antennas or tower will not interfere with the purpose for which
the city owned property is intended.
      2.   The city council must find that the antennas or tower will have no
significant adverse impact on surrounding private property.
      3.   The applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and
commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation for the use
of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards. The fees shall be
established by the city council after considering comparable rates in other
cities, potential expenses, risks to the city, and other appropriate factors;
      4.   The applicant will submit a letter of credit, performance bond or
other security acceptable to the city to cover the costs of the antenna's or
tower's removal;
      5.   The antenna or tower will not interfere with other users who have a
higher priority as discussed in subsection 3-17-9C of this chapter;
      6.   Upon reasonable notice, the antenna or tower may be required to be
removed at the user's expense;
      7.   The applicant/user must reimburse the city for any costs which it
incurs because of the presence of the applicant's or user's antenna or tower;
      8.   The user must obtain all necessary land use approvals; and
      9.   The applicant will cooperate with the city's objective to promote
collocations and thus limit the number of separate antenna sites requested.
   B.   Special Requirements: The use of certain city owned property, such as
water tower sites and parks, for antennas or towers, brings with it special
concerns due to the unique nature of these sites. The placement of antennas or
towers on these special city owned sites will be allowed only when the
following additional requirements are met:
      1.   Water Tower Or Reservoir Sites: The city's water towers and
reservoirs represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization
and peak capacity reserves. Protection of the quality of the city's water
supply is of prime importance to the city. As access to the city's water
storage systems increases, so too increases the potential for contamination of
the public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of antennas or towers
on water tower or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the city is fully
satisfied that the following requirements are met:
         a.   The applicant's access to the facility will not increase the
risks of contamination to the city's water supply;
         b.   There is sufficient room on the structure and/or on the grounds
to accommodate the applicant's facility;
         c.   The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or
reservoir maintenance cost to the city; and
         d.   The presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health of
workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir.
      2.   Parks: The presence of certain antennas or towers represents a
potential conflict with the purpose of some city owned parks. In no case shall
towers be allowed in designated conservation areas unless they are to be
installed in areas which currently contain tower facilities. Antennas or towers
will be considered only after approval of the city council. The following
criteria will be considered in the priority listed below:
         a.   Public parks of a sufficient scale and character to accommodate a
cell tower site;
         b.   Commercial recreation areas and major play fields; and
         c.   Park maintenance facilities. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-11: APPLICATION PROCESS:
All applicants who wish to locate an antenna or tower on city owned property
must submit to the community development department a completed application and
detailed plan that complies with the submittal requirements of this chapter,
the zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, general plan and other regulations
and ordinances of the city, along with other pertinent information requested by
the city. All completed applications shall be submitted to the city council for
their consideration. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-12: TERMINATION OF LEASE:
   A.   Conditions: The city council may terminate any lease if it determines
that any one of the following conditions exist:
      1.   A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate
location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use;
      2.   A user's frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other
users of higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was
adequately predicted in the technical analysis; or
      3.   A user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the
conditions attached to the city's lease or other authorization.
   B.   Notice Requirements: Before taking action, the city will provide notice
to the user of the intended termination and the reasons for it, and provide an
opportunity for the user to address the city council regarding the proposed
action. This procedure need not be followed in emergency situations. (Ord.
2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-13: RESERVATION OF RIGHT:
Notwithstanding the above, the city council reserves the right to deny, for any
reason, the use of any or all city owned property by any one or all applicants.
(Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-14: COLLOCATION; USE OF PUBLIC PROPERTY:
To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers,
collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing or new towers and
location of such antennas on public property shall take precedent over the
construction of new single use towers as follows:
   A.   Considerations: Proposed antenna may, and are encouraged to, collocate
onto existing towers, provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner
consistent with the policy, site criteria and landscape/screening provisions
contained in this chapter, then such collocations are permitted by right and
new or additional conditional use approval is not required, except that any
other permit, license, lease or franchise requirements must be satisfied.
   B.   Waiver Of Conditional Use Requirement: Any conditional use requirement
for an antenna may be waived in nonresidential zones if the applicant locates
the antenna on an existing structure other than an existing tower and/or if the
antenna is proposed to be located on suitable public property such as a water
tower, government building, or other public tower or pole. Suitability of
public property shall be determined in the city's sole discretion. The
applicant must submit detailed plans to the planning department for an
administrative review to determine compliance with this chapter and the
applicable zoning ordinances. No building permit will be issued until approval
is granted through an administrative review.
   C.   Denial: The city may deny the application to construct a new tower if
the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an
existing structure and/or public property.
   D.   Design To Accommodate Additional Antenna: In order to reduce the number
of antenna support structures needed in the city in the future, any new
proposed support structure shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more
than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not
feasible for economic, technical or physical reasons.
   E.   Provide Additional Space: Unless collocation has been demonstrated to
be infeasible, the site plan shall delineate an area near the base of the tower
to be used for the placement of additional equipment buildings for other users.
The site plan for towers in excess of eighty feet (80') must propose space for
three (3) comparable tower users while the site plan for towers under eighty
feet (80') must propose space for one comparable tower user. To provide further
incentive for collocation as a primary option, an existing tower may be
modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional
antenna, provided the additional antenna shall be of the same type as that on
the existing tower. This is permitted by right for existing towers in all
zoning districts, subject to the following criteria being met:
      1.   Additional Height: An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a
taller height, not to exceed twenty feet (20') over the tower's existing
height, to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna. The height
change may occur only once per tower.
      2.   One Tower Per Site: A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on site within fifty feet
(50') of its existing location so long as it remains within the same zone and
complies with the other provisions of this chapter. After the tower is rebuilt
to accommodate collocation, only one tower may remain on site. (Ord. 2000-35,
9-19-2000)
3-17-15: DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   Multiple Users: As provided above, new tower sites shall be designed to
accommodate antenna for more than one user, unless the applicant demonstrates
why such design is not feasible for economic, technical or physical reasons.
   B.   Compatibility: Facilities should be architecturally compatible with the
surrounding buildings and land uses in the zoning district or otherwise
integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
   C.   Setback: Tower setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower to
the property line of the parcel on which it is located. Unless there are
unusual geographical limitations, as determined in the city's sole discretion,
in residential districts and residential land use areas where permitted, towers
shall be set back from residential structures in a residential district a
distance equal to three hundred percent (300%) of tower height as measured from
ground level, unless said tower is located on city owned property. Towers shall
comply with the minimum setback requirements of the area in which they are
located in all other zoning districts.
   D.   Color: Towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or
background that minimizes their visibility and must be approved by the city,
unless a different color is required by the FCC or FAA.
   E.   Lights, Signals And Signs: No signals, lights or signs shall be
permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or the FAA. Should lighting be
required, at the time of construction of the tower in cases where there are
residential users located within a distance which is three hundred percent
(300%) of the height of the tower from the tower, then approval of dual mode
lighting shall be requested from the FAA.
   F.   Equipment Structures:
      1.   Ground level equipment and buildings and the tower base shall be
screened from view from public streets and residentially zoned properties. The
standards for the equipment and buildings are as follows:
         a.   The maximum floor area is three hundred feet (300') and the
maximum height is twelve feet (12').
         b.   Ground level buildings shall be screened from adjacent properties
by landscape plantings, opaque fencing or other appropriate means, as specified
in this chapter or in this code.
         c.   Equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar
to the exterior walls of the main building upon which the equipment is mounted.
Equipment for roof mounted antennas may also be located within the building
upon which the antenna is mounted.
      2.   Equipment buildings, antennas and related equipment shall occupy no
more than twenty five percent (25%) of the total roof area of a building.
      3.   Antenna or equipment buildings not meeting these standards require a
special exception. The use must be approved by the city council on a
comprehensive sketch plan or final development plan, as applicable.
   G.   Federal Requirements: All towers must meet or exceed current standards
and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal
government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such
standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within three (3) months
of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more
stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency.
Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower
or antenna at the owner's expense.
   H.   Building Code; Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance
with standards contained in applicable city building codes and the applicable
standards for towers that are published by the electronic industries
association (EIA), as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the city
concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such
tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such
tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the city may remove such
tower at the owner's expense.
   I.   Structural Design: Towers shall be constructed to the EIA standards,
which may be amended from time to time, and all applicable construction/
building codes. Further, any improvements and/or additions to existing towers
shall require submission of site plans sealed and verified by a professional
engineer which demonstrate compliance with the EIA standards and all other good
industry practices in effect at the time of said improvement or addition. Said
plans shall be submitted to and reviewed at the time building permits are
requested.
   J.   Fencing: A well constructed masonry or stone wall, not less than eight
feet (8') in height from finished grade, shall be provided around each tower. A
chainlink fence not less than eight feet (8') in height from finished grade may
be provided around a tower upon approval by the city council. Access to any
tower shall be through a locked gate. Security fencing should be colored or
should be of a design which blends into the character of the existing
environment.
   K.   Antenna Height: The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna is the
minimum height required to function satisfactorily. No antenna that is taller
than this minimum height shall be approved.
   L.   Antenna Support Structure Safety: The applicant shall demonstrate that
the proposed antenna and support structure are safe, and the surrounding areas
will not be negatively affected by support structure failure, falling ice or
other debris or interference. All support structures shall be fitted with anti-
climbing devices, as approved by the manufacturers.
   M.   Required Parking: If the cell site is fully automated, adequate parking
may be required for maintenance workers as a condition of approval. If the site
is not automated, arrangements for adequate off street parking shall be made
and documentation thereof provided to the city.
   N.   Antenna Criteria: Antenna on or above a structure shall be subject to
the following:
      1.   The antenna must be architecturally compatible with the building and
wall on which it is mounted and designed and located so as to minimize any
adverse aesthetic impact.
      2.   An antenna mounted on a wall of an existing building shall be
mounted in configuration as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall
not project above the wall on which it is mounted unless for technical reasons
the antenna needs to project above the roofline. In no event shall an antenna
project more than ten feet (10') above the roofline.
      3.   The antenna shall be constructed, painted or fully screened to match
as closely as possible the color and texture of the building or wall on which
it is mounted.
      4.   The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical
equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building, but may not
project any higher than the enclosure, or ten feet (10') from the roofline.
      5.   If an accessory equipment shelter is present, it must blend in with
the surrounding buildings in architectural character and color.
      6.   The structure must be architecturally and visually (color, size,
bulk) compatible with surrounding existing buildings, structures, and
vegetation and/or uses or those likely to exist under the terms of the
underlying zoning to the extent possible. Such facilities will be considered
architecturally and visually compatible if they are camouflaged to disguise the
facility.
      7.   When locating and developing a site, the preexisting character of
the site shall be preserved as much as possible. Existing vegetation should be
preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site
should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact
of the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual mitigation
techniques must be evaluated by city, in city's sole discretion, taking into
consideration the site as built.
      8.   On buildings thirty feet (30') or less in height, the antenna may be
mounted on the roof if:
         a.   The city finds that it is not technically possible or
aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall.
         b.   No portion of the antenna or base station causes the height of
the building to exceed the limitations set forth herein.
         c.   The antenna or antennas and related base stations cover no more
than an aggregate total of twenty five percent (25%) of the roof area of a
building.
         d.   Roof mounted antenna and related base stations are completely
screened from view by materials that are consistent and compatible with the
design, color and materials of the building.
         e.   No portion of the antenna may exceed ten feet (10') above the
height of the existing building.
         f.   The antenna is located as close to the center of the roof as
possible.
      9.   If a proposed antenna is located on a building or a lot subject to a
site review, approval is required prior to the issuance of a building permit.
      10.   No antenna shall be permitted on property designated as an
individual landmark or as a part of an historic district, unless such antenna
has been approved in accordance with this code.
      11.   No antenna owner, or lessee or officer or employee thereof, shall
fail to cooperate in good faith to accommodate other competitors in their
attempts to use the same building for other antennas. If a dispute arises about
the feasibility of accommodating another competitor, the city council may
require a third party technical study, at the expense of either or both
parties, to resolve the dispute.
      12.   No antenna owner or lessee shall fail to assure that the antenna
complies at all times with the then current applicable American national
standards institute or FCC standards, whichever are more stringent. After
installation, but prior to putting the antenna into service, each antenna owner
shall provide a certification by an independent professional engineer to that
effect.
      13.   No antenna shall cause localized interference with the reception of
any other communications signals, including, but not limited to, public safety
signals, and television and radio broadcast signals.
      14.   No person shall locate an antenna or tower on any lot or parcel
except as provided in this chapter. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)

   A.   Landscaping: Landscaping, as described herein, shall be required to
screen as much of the support structure as possible, the fence surrounding the
support structure and any other ground level features (such as a building), and
in general soften the appearance of the cell site. The city may permit any
combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or
other features instead of landscaping, if they achieve the same degree of
screening as the required landscaping. If the antenna is mounted flush on an
existing building, and other equipment is housed inside an existing structure,
landscaping shall not be required.
   B.   Screening: The visual impacts of a tower shall be mitigated through
landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary
structures. The following landscaping and buffering of towers shall be required
around the perimeter of the tower and accessory structures, except that the
standards may be waived by the city for those sides of the proposed tower that
are located adjacent to undevelopable lands and lands not in public view:

requirements. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-19-2000)
3-17-19: NONUSE; ABANDONMENT:
   A.   Determination: In the event the use of any tower has been discontinued
for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the city
which shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the
tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. Upon such abandonment,
the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional sixty (60) days within
which to:
      1.   Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another
owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or
      2.   Dismantle and remove the tower. If such tower is not removed within
said sixty (60) days, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense. If
there are two (2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall
not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
   B.   Expiration Of City Approval: At the earlier of sixty (60) days from the

3-17-21: THIRD PARTY REVIEW:
The personal wireless service providers use various methodologies and analyses
tools, including geographically based computer software, to determine the
specific technical parameters of personal wireless services and low power
mobile radio service facilities, such as expected coverage area, antenna
configuration, topographic constraints that affect signal paths, etc. In
certain instances there may be a need for expert review by a third party of the
technical data submitted by the personal wireless services or low power mobile
radio service provider. The city council or the planning commission may require
such a technical review, to be paid for by the applicant for the personal
wireless services or low power mobile radio service facilities. The selection
of the third party expert may be by mutual agreement among the applicant and
city or at the discretion of the city, with a provision for the applicant and
interested parties to comment on the proposed expert and review its
qualification. The expert review is intended to be a site specific review of
technical aspects of the personal wireless services or low power mobile radio
services facilities and not a subjective review of the site selection. Such a
review should address the accuracy and completeness of the technical data,
whether the analysis techniques and methodologies are legitimate, the validity
of the conclusions, and any specific technical issues outlined by the city
council, planning commission, city staff or interested parties. Based on the
results of the third party review, the city may require changes to the
application for the personal wireless services or low power mobile radio
service facilities that comply with the recommendations of the expert. The
expert review of the technical submission shall address the following:
   A.   The accuracy and completeness of submissions;
   B.   The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;
   C.   The validity of conclusions reached;
   D.   Any specific technical issues designated by the city. (Ord. 2000-35, 9-
19-2000)
3-17-22: PENALTY:
   A.   Fine: Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions
or terms of this chapter, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to
exceed the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day during which the
offense continued.
   B.   Injunctive Relief: In addition to receiving any monetary remuneration,
the city shall have the right to seek injunctive relief for any and all
violations of this chapter and all other remedies provided at law or in equity.

following determinations made by the chief of police, police officer or other
department personnel dispatched to the premises reporting an alarm signal are
correct:
   A.   There is no evidence of a fire, crime or other activity that would
warrant a call for immediate fire or police assistance at the premises;
   B.   No individual who was on or near the premises or who has viewed a video
communication from the premises called for a police or fire dispatch or
verified a need for an immediate department response; and
   C.   There is no evidence that violent conditions of nature or other
extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the alarm user caused the
activation of the alarm. (Ord. 2003-9, 7-1-2003)
3-18-8: FALSE ALARMS; PENALTY:

      2.   Second false alarm: Fifty dollars ($50.00);

system in question has a history of unreliability, which unreliability shall be
presumed upon the occurrence of five (5) false alarms within a ninety (90) day
period.
   E.   A suspension for unreliability may be lifted upon a showing that the
conditions which caused the false alarms have been corrected. An alarm user
whose alarm permit is suspended by the city shall pay a reinstatement fee of
fifty dollars ($50.00) to the city before such permit shall be reinstated.

provisions of this section.
   G.   Any person who uses, maintains, operates or is in control of any
operational alarm system in the city while the alarm permit for such alarm
system is suspended shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor.
   H.   To discourage false alarms, the department of public safety shall adopt
a process of providing written notice to an alarm user who has more than one
false alarm in a calendar year of the consequences of excessive false alarms,
the need to take corrective action, and the prospect that four (4) false alarms
in a six (6) month period may result in the department disregarding any future
alarms from the premises unless independent information that verifies the need
for an immediate police response is provided.
   I.   Prior to determining not to respond to a premises, the chief of police
shall provide written notice to the user that:
      1.   Four (4) false alarms have been received from the property within a
six (6) month period;
      2.   The remedies authorized in this chapter as noted above are to be
instituted;
      3.   The alarm system user may request a hearing before the chief and
explain why the chief should not take the proposed action;
      4.   If no hearing is requested, the department will after ten (10) days
from the delivery of the notice disregard alarms from the premises unless there
is an in person call or other independent information that verifies the need
for an immediate police response; and
      5.   A requirement of an in person communication or other verification
shall remain in effect until notified otherwise. (Ord. 2003-9, 7-1-2003)

fee, suspension of any permit, or the determination of a false alarm. A written
request for a hearing must be filed by the alarm user with the department of
public safety within ten (10) business days for the date of mailing of the
notice of imposition of the penalty. Notice of the imposition of a penalty
shall be considered satisfied if sent by regular mail to the alarm user's
address listed in the alarm users's alarm information card. The request for a
hearing shall include the alarm user's name, address, telephone number, and a
statement of the reasons for disputing the imposition of the penalty. A timely
request for a hearing shall stay the imposition of any penalty until the
hearing is decided. The city's determination of a false alarm, the imposition
of a service fee, or suspension of a permit shall be considered final if the
alarm user fails to request a hearing within the time period set forth above.
   B.   The director of public safety or designated representative shall
conduct any hearings requested by the alarm users and shall affirm, modify, or
vacate the imposition of the penalty after considering all of the evidence
presented. An alarm shall be presumed to be a false alarm unless the alarm user
can establish the existence of an emergency or other hazard at the time of the
alarm by a preponderance of the evidence. The burden of proving the existence
of an emergency shall be upon the alarm user. Hearings shall be conducted
informally.
   C.   An alarm user may appeal the decision of the director of public safety
or designated representative, to the city administrator by filing a written
request for a hearing with the city administrator within ten (10) business days

definitions is to allow the city to classify an offending situation, conduct or
activity as a nuisance, even though the situation, conduct or activity may not
be listed as a nuisance in the specific examples. The first three (3) general
definitions are taken directly from state law. The purpose of listing the
specific examples is to identify some of the specific situations, conduct and
activities that the city intends to abate as nuisances.

more of the five (5) definitions set forth below shall constitute a "nuisance"

pursuant to this chapter. Every successive owner or tenant of a property or
premises who fails to abate a continuing nuisance upon or in the use of such
property or premises caused by a former owner or tenant is responsible therefor
in the same manner as the one who first created it. (Ord. 2002-7, 4-16-2002)
4-3-6: ADMINISTRATION; ENFORCEMENT:
This chapter shall be administered and enforced by the public safety
department, in case of nuisance involving dangerous buildings or violations of
codes typically administered and enforced by the community development
department, this chapter may also be administered and enforced by the community
development department. (Ord. 2002-7, 4-16-2002)
4-3-7: FINDING OF NUISANCE:
If a code enforcement officer finds that a nuisance exists, the officer shall
attempt to have the responsible person abate the nuisance. Although the
officer's first step in correcting or abating the nuisance will always be to
obtain voluntary compliance, the officer may pursue any remedy or combination
of remedies available pursuant to this chapter, state law or common law in
order to abate the nuisance. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to
prohibit the city from engaging in its standard prosecution practices.
Therefore, the city may prosecute violators of city ordinances or state laws
without first having to comply with the provisions of this chapter, even though
the activity or conduct prosecuted may also constitute a nuisance under this
chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prevent the city from
enforcing applicable city ordinances, building codes or the abatement of
dangerous buildings code without first treating the offending conduct,
situation or activity as a nuisance pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2002-7, 4-
16-2002)
4-3-8: VOLUNTARY CORRECTION:
This section applies whenever a code enforcement officer determines that a
nuisance exists.
   A.   Contact: Before taking other steps to abate the nuisance, the code
enforcement officer shall make a reasonable attempt to secure voluntary
correction or abatement of the nuisance by:
      1.   Contacting the responsible person, where possible;
      2.   Explaining the nuisance;
      3.   Requesting the responsible person to abate the nuisance; and
      4.   Agreeing to terms with the responsible person to abate the nuisance.
   B.   No Agreement: If the code enforcement officer and the responsible
person cannot agree to terms for correcting or abating the nuisance, the
officer may still abate the nuisance using one or more of the procedures set
forth in this chapter, state law or common law.
   C.   Voluntary Correction Agreement; Extension:
      1.   If a code enforcement officer and the responsible person agree to
terms for abating the nuisance, they shall enter into and sign a voluntary
correction agreement. The voluntary correction agreement is a contract between
the city and the responsible person in which the responsible person agrees to
abate the nuisance within a specified time and according to specified
conditions. The voluntary correction agreement shall include the following
terms:
         a.   The name and address of the responsible person;
         b.   The street address of the nuisance, or a description sufficient
to identify the building, structure, premises or land upon or within which the
nuisance is occurring;
         c.   A description of the nuisance;
         d.   The necessary corrective action to be taken, and a date or time
by which correction must be completed;
         e.   An agreement by the responsible person that the city may inspect
the premises as may be necessary to determine compliance with the voluntary
correction agreement;
         f.   An agreement by the responsible person that the city may abate
the nuisance and recover its costs and expenses to abate the nuisance, as well
as a monetary fine pursuant to this chapter from the responsible person, if the
terms of the voluntary correction agreement are not met;
         g.   An agreement by the responsible person acknowledges that he/she
waives the right to appeal the code enforcement officer's finding that a
nuisance exists and waives the right to appeal the specific corrective action
required in the voluntary correction agreement; and
         h.   An agreement by the responsible person that failure to comply
with the voluntary correction agreement may be grounds for criminal
prosecution.
      2.   A code enforcement officer may grant an extension of the time limit
for correcting or abating the nuisance if the responsible person has shown due
diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting or abating the nuisance but
unforeseen circumstances render abatement under the original conditions
unattainable. If the responsible person complies with the terms of the
voluntary correction agreement, the city shall take no further action against
the responsible person related to the nuisance described in the voluntary
correction agreement unless the nuisance recurs. (Ord. 2002-7, 4-16-2002)
4-3-9: ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION:
   A.   Authority; Conditions: When the code enforcement officer determines
that a nuisance exists, and is unable to secure voluntary correction pursuant
to section
4-3-8 of this chapter, the officer may issue an administrative citation to the
responsible person. The officer may issue an administrative citation without
having attempted to secure voluntary correction as provided in section
4-3-8 of this chapter under the following circumstances:
      1.   When an emergency exists; or
      2.   When the code enforcement officer is unable to locate or determine
the identity of the responsible person.
   B.   Content Of Administrative Citation: The administrative citation shall
include the following:
      1.   The name and address of the responsible person; and
      2.   The street address of the nuisance or a description sufficient for
identifying the building, structure, premises or land upon or within which the
nuisance is occurring; and
      3.   A description of the nuisance; and
      4.   The required corrective action; and
      5.   The completion date and a notice that the city may abate the
nuisance and charge the responsible person for all abatement costs if the
responsible person does not correct the nuisance before the completion date;
and
      6.   The time for appealing the administrative citation to the hearing
officer and the procedure for filing an appeal; and
      7.   A statement indicating that no monetary fine will be assessed if a
code enforcement officer approves the completed, required corrective action
prior to the completion date; and
      8.   A statement that the city may abate the nuisance and assess costs
and expenses of the abatement and a monetary fine against the responsible
person if the correction is not completed by the responsible person and
approved by the code enforcement officer before the completion date.
   C.   Service Of Administrative Citation: A code enforcement officer shall
serve the administrative citation upon the responsible person, either
personally or by mailing certified, return receipt requested, a copy of the
administrative citation to the responsible person at his/her last known
address. If the responsible person cannot, after due diligence, be personally
served within Utah County and if an address for mailed service cannot, after
due diligence, be ascertained, notice shall be served by posting a copy of the
administrative citation conspicuously on the affected property or structure.
Proof of service shall be made by a written declaration under penalty of
perjury executed by the person effecting the service, declaring the time and
date of service, the manner by which the service was made and, if by posting,
the facts showing that due diligence was used in attempting to serve the person
personally or by mail.
   D.   No Extension: No extension of the time specified in the administrative
citation for correction of the nuisance may be granted, except by order of the
hearing officer. (Ord. 2002-7, 4-16-2002)
4-3-10: OTHER REMEDIES:
The city may take one or more of the following actions against any responsible
person who fails to comply with the terms of a voluntary consent agreement, an
administrative citation, or an order of the hearing officer:
   A.   Abatement By City:
      1.   The city may abate a nuisance when:
         a.   The terms of a voluntary correction agreement have not been met;
or
         b.   The requirements of an administrative citation have not been
complied with or, if the administrative citation is appealed to a hearing
officer and the terms of the administrative citation are amended by the hearing
officer, the terms of the hearing officer's order have not been complied with;
or
         c.   The condition is subject to summary abatement as provided for in
subsection A2 of this section.
      2.   Whenever a nuisance is occurring which constitutes an immediate and
emergent threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment,
the city may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of
such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the responsible
person as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.
      3.   Using any lawful means, the city may enter upon the subject property
and may remove or correct the condition which is subject to abatement. The city
may seek, but is not required to seek, such judicial process as it deems
necessary to effect the removal or correction of such condition.
      4.   The costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting or abating
the violation shall be billed to the responsible person and/or the owner,
lessor, tenant or other person entitled to control, use and/or occupy the
property and shall become due and payable to the city within ten (10) days of
actual receipt of the bill (within 15 days of the mailing date if the bill is
mailed). The term "incidental expenses" includes, but is not limited to:
         a.   Personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney
fees and costs;
         b.   Costs incurred in documenting the violation;
         c.   Hauling, storage and disposal expenses;
         d.   Actual expenses and costs for the city in preparing notices,
specifications and contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and
inspecting the work; and
         e.   The costs of any required printing and mailing.
   B.   Monetary Fine:
      1.   The responsible person shall pay the city a monetary fine for each
day the nuisance continues after the completion date. The nuisance shall be
considered to continue until the code enforcement officer approves the
responsible person's actions to correct or abate the nuisance. The amount of
the monetary fine shall be as follows:
         a.   One hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day during the
first week that the nuisance remains uncorrected or unabated after the
completion date;
         b.   Two hundred dollars ($200.00) per day for each day thereafter
until the nuisance is corrected or abated according to the terms set forth in
the administrative citation.
      2.   The monetary fine shall be cumulative and may not be waived by the
code enforcement officer. Payment of a monetary fine pursuant to this section
does not relieve the responsible person from the duty to abate the nuisance as
required by the voluntary consent agreement or the administrative citation. The
monetary fine constitutes a personal obligation of the responsible person. Any
monetary fine assessed must be paid to the city within ten (10) calendar days
from the date of mailing of the hearing officer's decision and order or a
notice from the city that the fine is due. The city attorney or his/her
designee is authorized to take appropriate action to collect the monetary fine,
plus reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in collecting said monetary
fine.
   C.   Civil Actions: Either the city or any private person directly affected
by a nuisance may bring a civil action to abate or enjoin the nuisance, or for
damages for causing or maintaining the nuisance (including the cost, if any, of
cleaning the subject property). The civil action may be brought pursuant to
this chapter or pursuant to state law.
   D.   Criminal Actions: Criminal actions may be initiated by criminal
citation from a code enforcement officer or by long form information. (Ord.
2002-7, 4-16-2002)
      1.   Any person who maintains or assists in maintaining a nuisance is
guilty of a class C misdemeanor and upon conviction, subject to penalty as
provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. No person shall be prosecuted under this subsection D1
unless the code enforcement officer first attempted to obtain voluntary
correction as provided in section
4-3-8 of this chapter.
      2.   If the alleged nuisance is also a violation of a provision of city
code (other than this nuisance chapter), or state law, the responsible person
may be charged under the specific provision of city code or state law, even if
the officer did not first attempt to obtain voluntary correction as provided in
section of
4-3-8 of this chapter.
      3.   Any person who knowingly obstructs, impedes or interferes with the
city or its agents, or with the responsible person, in the performance of
duties imposed by this chapter, or a decision and order issued by the hearing
officer, or a voluntary correction agreement, is guilty of a class B
misdemeanor and upon conviction, subject to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. (Ord. 2002-7, 4-16-2002; amd. 2003 Code)
   E.   Abatement By Eviction: Whenever there is reason to believe that a
nuisance under subsections 4-3-3B1 through B6 of this chapter is kept,
maintained or exists in the city, the city attorney or any citizen residing in
the city, or any person or entity doing business in the city, in his or their
own names, may maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate
the nuisance and obtain an order for the automatic eviction of the tenant of
the property harboring the nuisance. The eviction shall take place as specified
in state law.
   F.   Lien For Costs: If a person fails to pay any fines or costs related to
nuisance abatement when due, the city may record a lien on the property or
premises for the full amount of the unpaid fines and costs.
   G.   Nonexclusive Remedies: The city may take any or all of the above
mentioned remedies (administrative, civil or criminal) to abate a nuisance and/
or to punish any person or entity who creates, causes or allows a nuisance to
exist. The abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice the right of the city or
any person to recover damages or penalties for its past existence. (Ord. 2002-
7, 4-16-2002)
4-3-11: APPEALS:
   A.   Grounds: Any person receiving an administrative citation may appeal the
administrative citation to the hearing officer. Only the following issues may
be appealed to the hearing officer:
      1.   The person charged in the administrative citation as the responsible
person is not the "responsible person", as defined by this chapter.
      2.   The condition described as a nuisance in the administrative citation
is not a "nuisance", as defined by this chapter.
      3.   The method required by the administrative citation to abate the
nuisance is inappropriate or is not the most cost effective method of
effectively correcting or abating the nuisance.
      4.   The time period given to abate the nuisance in the administrative
citation is unreasonable.
      5.   The monetary fine set forth in the administrative citation is
unreasonable.
      6.   The code enforcement officer refused to approve a corrective action
that met the requirements of the administrative citation.
      7.   The responsible person claims that the requirements of the
administrative citation violates his/her constitutional rights.
   B.   Filing: The person desiring to appeal must file a notice at the city's
public safety building within ten (10) days of receipt of the administrative
citation (within 15 days of the mailing date if the administrative citation is
mailed).
   C.   Hearing: The hearing before the hearing officer shall be informal
according to rules and procedures established by the hearing officer. The
appellant may, but is not required to, bring an attorney or other
representative to assist him or her. The appellant and the code enforcement
officer may each call witnesses at the hearing. The hearing officer may, with
or without the parties present, visit the site of the alleged nuisance. If the
hearing officer allows the parties at the site visit, both parties must be
given the opportunity to be present. The hearing shall be scheduled by the
hearing officer within thirty (30) days of when the notice of appeal is filed
with the city.
   D.   Burden Of Proof: The appellant shall have the burden of proof to
demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he/she had legitimate
grounds for an appeal. The determination of the code enforcement officer as to
the need for the required corrective action shall be accorded substantial
weight by the hearing officer in determining the reasonableness of the
corrective action.
   E.   Authority Of Hearing Officer:
      1.   The hearing officer shall have authority to affirm or vacate the
administrative citation, or to modify or waive specific provisions of the
administrative citation. If the appellant fails to attend the hearing, the
hearing officer shall affirm the administrative citation. The hearing officer
shall not vacate the administrative citation unless he/she finds that no
nuisance exists. The hearing officer shall modify the administrative citation
if he/she finds that a nuisance exists, but that one or more of the
requirements of the administrative citation is improper or inappropriate. A
requirement is improper if it is contrary to this chapter. A requirement is
inappropriate if the hearing officer finds that there is a better means of
resolving the problem or that the proposed solution is inappropriate given the
nature or severity of the problem. When determining whether to waive or modify
a requirement of the administrative citation, the hearing officer may also
consider:
         a.   Whether the appellant responded to the code enforcement officer's
attempts to contact the appellant and cooperated with efforts to correct the
nuisance;
         b.   Whether the appellant has shown due diligence and/or substantial
progress in correcting the nuisance;
         c.   The financial ability of the appellant and the amount, if any,
that the appellant has benefitted financially by maintaining the nuisance.
         d.   Any other relevant factors.
      2.   If the appellant appeals the code enforcement officer's refusal to
approve appellant's corrective action, the hearing officer shall visit the site
and determine if the appellant complied with the requirements of the
administrative citation.
   F.   Order: The hearing officer shall issue a written order to the appellant
and the city notifying them of his/her decision. The order shall include the
hearing officer's findings of fact and ultimate decision. If the hearing
officer modifies or waives provisions of the administrative citation, the order
shall specify which portions are modified and how they are modified. The
hearing officer shall mail a copy of the order to the appellant and the city
within five (5) working days of the close of the hearing.
   G.   Appeal To District Court: Either the city or the appellant may appeal
the hearing officer's order by filing a petition for review of the order. The
petition must be filed in the fourth district court within thirty (30) calendar
days from the date the hearing officer's order was mailed to the appellant. In
the petition, the plaintiff may only allege that the hearing officer's order
was arbitrary, capricious or illegal. The hearing officer shall transmit to the
reviewing court the record of its proceedings, including any minutes, findings,
orders and if available, a true and correct transcript of its proceedings. If,
in the opinion of the district court, there is a sufficient record to review
the hearing officer's order, the court's review is limited to the record
provided by the hearing officer. The district court may not accept or consider
any evidence outside of the hearing officer's record unless the evidence was
offered to the hearing officer and the court determines that it was improperly
excluded by the hearing officer. If, in the opinion of the district court,
there is not a sufficient record to review the hearing officer's order, the
court may call witnesses and take evidence. No petition or appeal may be filed
in district court unless the responsible person first appeals to the hearing
officer pursuant to the terms set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 2002-7, 4-16-
2002)

For the purpose of administration of this chapter, the community development
director is hereby appointed as the city inspector for the purpose of carrying
out the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 91-6, 8-6-1991)
4-4-4: DUTIES OF INSPECTOR:
   A.   Inspect And Examine Property: The inspector is authorized and directed
to inspect and examine real property situated within the city for the purpose
of determining whether or not it contains the above stated objects, or similar
objects or conditions.
   B.   Existence Of Conditions: If the inspector concludes that such
conditions exist in whole or in part, he shall:
      1.   Ascertain the names of the owners and/or occupants and descriptions
of the premises where such objects and conditions exist;
      2.   Serve notice in writing upon the owners and/or occupants of such
land, either personally or by mailing notice, postage prepaid, addressed to the
owner and occupant at their last known post office addresses, as disclosed by
the records of the county assessor, or as otherwise ascertained, requiring such
owners or occupants, or both, as the case may be, to eradicate or destroy and
remove the same within such time as the inspector may designate, which shall
not be less than ten (10) days from the date of service of such notice;
      3.   Inform the owners and/or occupants by means of such notice or an
attached document that in the event they disagree with the determination of the
inspector and do not wish to remove the objects or objectionable conditions,
they may within five (5) days from the date of service of such notice request
in writing a hearing before the city council at a time and place to be set by
the city council. A written application for a hearing shall stay the time
within which the owners and/or occupants must conform to the decision of the
inspector.
   C.   Hearing Set: In the event the owners and/or occupants make such request
for a hearing, the city council shall set the time and place for hearing such
objections and the city recorder shall notify the owners and/or occupants in
writing of the time and place at which they may appear and be heard. The
hearing shall not be heard within less than five (5) days from the date of
service or mailing of said notice. One notice shall be deemed sufficient on any
lot or parcel of property for the entire season of weed growth during that
year. The inspector shall make proof of service of such notice under oath and
file the same in the office of the county treasurer. (Ord. 91-6, 8-6-1991)
4-4-5: HEARING:
   A.   Conduct: Upon receipt of a written request for hearing of an owner or
occupant ordered to remove or abate said weeds, objectional conditions or
objects from his real property, delivered to the city recorder within the time
provided for above, the city council shall conduct an informal hearing, which
need not be recorded, wherein said owner or occupant may present such evidence
and argument as is relevant to the question of whether or not the removal or
abatement of said objects or conditions is within the purview of this chapter.
The city council shall also permit the presentation of evidence and argument by
the city inspector and other interested parties. Thereafter, within not more
than ten (10) days, the city council shall, over the signature of the mayor or
such other member of the body as may be designated by resolution, render its
written decision, a copy of which shall be mailed to or served upon the owner
or occupant by the city inspector.
   B.   Uphold Inspector Decision: In the event the decision of the city
council upholds the determination of the city inspector, the notice originally
given by the city inspector, as above provided, shall be deemed to be
sufficient to require the owner and/or occupant to remove or abate said objects
or conditions and he shall have not more than ten (10) days from the date of
notice of the decision within which to conform thereto.
   C.   Overrule Or Modify Inspector Decision: In the event that the decision
of the city council either overrules or modifies the determination of the city
inspector, the written decision of the city council shall apprise the city
inspector of that fact and shall set forth the details and extent to which the
owner and/or occupant must make removal or other abatement of the objects or
conditions, if any. The owner and/or occupant shall be required to conform to
the decision of the city council within ten (10) days after service or mailing
of a copy of said decision and said decision shall be deemed to be the modified
decision of the city inspector.
   D.   Amended Notice And Proof Of Service: The city inspector shall file an
amended notice and proof of service of said notice and file the same in the
office of the county treasurer. (Ord. 91-6, 8-6-1991)
4-4-6: FAILURE TO COMPLY; REMOVAL OF NUISANCE:
If any owner and/or occupant of lands described in such notice or decision
shall fail or neglect to eradicate, or destroy and remove, such weeds, garbage,
refuse, objects or structures upon the premises in accordance with such notice
or decision, the city inspector may, at the expense of the city, employ
necessary assistance and cause such weeds, garbage, refuse, objects or
structures to be removed or destroyed and the nuisance thereby abated. The
inspector shall prepare an itemized statement of all expenses incurred in the
removal and destruction of the same and shall mail a copy thereof to the owner
and/or occupant, demanding payment within twenty (20) days of the date of
mailing. Said notice shall be deemed delivered when mailed by registered mail
addressed to the property owner's or occupant's last known address. In the
event the owner and/or occupant fails to make payment of the amount set forth
in said statement to the city treasurer within said twenty (20) days, the
inspector, on behalf of the city, may cause suit to be brought in any
appropriate court of law or may refer the matter to the county treasurer as
hereinafter provided. In the event collection of said costs are pursued through
the courts, the city may sue for and receive judgment upon all of said costs of
removal and destruction, together with reasonable attorney fees, interest and
court costs. The city may execute on such judgment in the manner provided by
law. In the event that the inspector elects to refer the matter to the county
treasurer for inclusion in the tax notice of the property owner, he shall make,
in triplicate, an itemized statement of all expenses incurred in the removal
and destruction of the same and shall deliver the three (3) copies of said
statement to the county treasurer within ten (10) days after the completion of
the work of removing such weeds, garbage, refuse, objects or structures. If the
city inspector refers the matter to the county treasurer, the county treasurer
shall pursue the collection of the cost of the work performed in accordance
with the provisions of Utah Code Annotated title 10, chapter 11, as amended,
and the owner shall have such rights and shall be subject to such powers as are
thereby granted. (Ord. 91-6, 8-6-1991)
4-4-7: COMPLIANCE WITH NOTICE:
It is unlawful for any owner or occupant of real property located within the
city to fail to comply with any notice issued by the city inspector pursuant to
this chapter. (Ord. 91-6, 8-6-1991)
4-4-8: ISSUANCE OF CITATION:
The city inspector may, without prior notice or demand, issue and deliver a
citation requiring any owner or occupant in violation of any of the terms and

found to be so encased at the time of disinterment.
      4.   City's Duties: The city sexton shall determine whether a
disinterment poses a danger to the health, safety, and welfare of city staff or
the public. The city sexton may refuse to perform a disinterment if he
determines there is a danger to the health, safety, and welfare of city staff
or the public. The city sexton may also refuse to authorize a disinterment if
he determines that the disinterment would disturb or damage an adjacent burial
lot. The city sexton may make his determination at any time during the
disinterment process.
Upon the determination that a disinterment poses no danger to the health,
safety, or welfare of city staff or the public and that the disinterment would
not disturb or damage an adjacent burial lot, the city shall excavate and
refill the burial lot. The city shall comply with any court order.
      5.   Requestor's Duties: Absent a court order and at least seven (7)
working days prior to a disinterment, the requesting party shall submit a
disinterment permit from the county board of health, the city's disinterment
affidavit of kinship and indemnification agreement form and pay all applicable
fees prior to the city commencing any disinterment.
The requestor shall arrange for and pay any associated costs for a funeral
director to be present at a disinterment.
The requestor shall arrange for and pay any associated costs for a licensed
vault company to remove the vault and its contents from the burial lot. If the
burial lot does not contain a vault or the city sexton determines the existing
vault has deteriorated to the point that it will not retain its structural
integrity during the disinterment, the requesting party shall replace the
deteriorated vault with a structurally sound vault at the requestor's expense.
The requestor shall arrange to dispose of any old vault in a manner meeting
federal, state, and local laws.

      1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the city;
      2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      3.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other
public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well-
being of the city and its citizens; and
      4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
   B.   Compensation: The city finds that the city should receive fair and
reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
   C.   Local Concern: The city finds that while telecommunications systems are
in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve
rights of way, municipal franchising and vital business and community service,
which are of local concern.
   D.   Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The city finds that it is in
the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid
development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory basis,
responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for
municipal, educational and community services.
   E.   Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in the interests of the
public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a
manner that:
      1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
      2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use the rights of way to serve the public;
      3.   Fully protects the public interest and the city from any harm that
may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
      4.   Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority of
the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
      5.   Otherwise protects the public interest in the development and use of
the city infrastructure;
      6.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of
way; and
      7.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunication services, within
the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act") (P.L. no. 96-104).
   F.   Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts this telecommunications
chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights of way, pursuant to common
law, the Utah constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and
reasonable compensation for the use of rights of way by providers as expressly
set forth by section 253 of the act. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)

of this chapter between the city and a franchisee that sets forth, subject to
this chapter, the terms and conditions under which a franchise will be

   A.   Conflicts: In the event of a conflict between any provision of this
chapter and a franchise entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this chapter
shall control.
   B.   New Developments: It shall be the policy of the city to liberally amend
this chapter, upon application of a provider, when necessary to enable the
provider to take advantage of any developments in the field of
telecommunications which will afford the provider an opportunity to more
effectively, efficiently or economically serve itself or the public. (Ord.
2000-39, 10-17-2000)

chapter or pursuant to a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be

immediately notify the city of any change in its name, address or telephone
number. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000; amd. 2003 Code)
   D.   Exercise Of Police Power: To the full extent permitted by applicable
law either now or in the future, the city reserves the right to adopt or issue
such rules, regulations, orders or other directives that it finds necessary or
appropriate in the lawful exercise of its police powers.
   E.   Construction:
      1.   Federal And State Statutes: This chapter shall be construed in a
manner consistent with all applicable federal and state statutes.
      2.   Applicability: This chapter shall apply to all franchises granted or
renewed after the effective date hereof. This chapter shall further apply, to
the extent permitted by applicable federal or state law, to all existing
franchises granted prior to the effective date hereof and to a provider
providing services, without a franchise, prior to the effective date hereof.
      3.   Other Applicable Ordinances: A provider's rights are subject to the
police powers of the city to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to the
health, safety and welfare of the public. A provider shall comply with all
applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the city pursuant to its
police powers. In particular, all providers shall comply with the city zoning
and other land use requirements.
      4.   City Failure To Enforce: A provider shall not be relieved of its
obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or any
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter by reason of any failure of the city
to enforce prompt compliance.
      5.   Construed According To Utah Law: This chapter and any franchise
granted pursuant to this chapter shall be construed and enforced in accordance
with the substantive laws of the state. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)
7-7-4: APPLICABILITY; EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Providers: This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for
providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of
the rights of way, including providers of both the system and service, those
providers of the system only and those providers who do not build the system
but who only provide services. This chapter shall apply to all future providers
and to all providers in the city prior to the effective date hereof, whether
operating with or without a franchise as set forth in subsection 7-7-3E2 of
this chapter.
   B.   Excluded Activities:
      1.   Cable Television Operators: This chapter shall not apply to cable
television operators otherwise regulated by the cable television ordinance.
      2.   Wireless Service Facilities: This chapter shall not apply to
personal wireless service facilities.
   C.   Excluded Providers; Provisions Applicable: Providers excused by other
law that prohibits the city from requiring a franchise shall not be required to
obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements imposed by this chapter through
the exercise of the city's police power and not preempted by other law shall be
applicable. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)
7-7-5: FRANCHISE REQUIRED:
   A.   Nonexclusive Franchise; Authority: The city is empowered and authorized
to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction and
maintenance of systems in the city rights of way, in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise
agreement entered into between the city and provider.
   B.   Provider Required To Obtain: Except to the extent preempted by federal
or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction,
including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to
constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications
services using the rights of way, and every provider must obtain a franchise
before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via
an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the
customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV
companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately
interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The
fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights of way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights of
way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period
stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned or
subleased, except as may be expressly provided in the franchise agreement. A
franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole
attachment agreements before collocating its system on the property of others,
including the city's property. This subsection shall not be construed to
prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the
lessee has obtained a franchise.
   D.   Current Providers; Time Limit To Request: Except to the extent exempted
by federal or state law, any provider acting without a franchise on the
effective date hereof shall request issuance of a franchise from the city
within ninety (90) days of the effective date hereof. If such request is made,
the provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations.
If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is
not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of subsection 7-7-
12D of this chapter.
   E.   Nature Of Franchise: The franchise granted by the city under the
provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the
right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system
on, over and under the rights of way in order to provide services.
   F.   Regulatory Approval Needed: Before offering or providing any services
pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if
required, and shall submit to the city, upon the written request of the city,
evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses.
   G.   Term: No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of
less than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)
7-7-6: APPLICATION FOR FRANCHISE:
   A.   Required; Form: To obtain a franchise to construct, own, maintain or
provide services through any system within the city, to obtain a renewal of a
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter or to obtain the city approval of a
transfer of a franchise, as provided in subsection 7-7-11A2 of this chapter,
granted pursuant to this chapter, an application must be filed with city on the
form attached to ordinance 2000-39 as exhibit A, and on file in the city
office, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The application form may be
changed by the community services director so long as such changes request
information that is consistent with this chapter. Such application form, as
amended, is incorporated by reference. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000; amd. 2003
Code)
   B.   Criteria: In making a determination as to an application filed pursuant
to this chapter, the city may, but shall not be limited to, request or consider
the following from the provider:
      1.   A copy of the order from the PSC granting a certificate of
convenience and necessity, if any is necessary for provider's offering of
services within the state.
      2.   Certification of the provider's financial ability to compensate the
city for provider's intrusion, maintenance and use of the rights of way during
the franchise term proposed by the provider.
      3.   Provider's agreement to comply with the requirements of section
7-7-9 of this chapter.
      4.   Proof of adequate liability insurance in an amount to be set by
resolution of the city council as required in subsection 7-7-8A of this
chapter.
   C.   Determination By City: The city, in its discretion, shall determine the
award of any franchise on the basis of these and other considerations relevant
to the use of the rights of way. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)
7-7-7: COMPENSATION, FEES AND PAYMENTS:
   A.   Compensation; Provider Obligations: As fair and reasonable compensation
for any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the
following obligations:
      1.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review
an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, a five
hundred dollars ($500.00) nonrefundable application fee to the city.
      2.   Franchise Fee: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date.
      3.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in section
7-8-5 of this title.
      4.   Failure To Pay: Providers who fail to obtain any required permit or
franchise, or to pay the required fees under this chapter, shall be subject to
a civil penalty of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), in addition to any other
fees or penalties due the city as provided for under this chapter.
   B.   Due: All franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty
five (45) days of the close of each calendar month.
   C.   Statement Of Calculation; Certification: Each fee payment shall be
accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated
and shall be certified as to its accuracy. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)
   D.   Future Costs: A provider shall pay to the city, or to third parties at
the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and
reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties
(including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection
with any renewal or provider initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this
chapter or a franchise. Any costs associated with any work to be done by the
public works department to provide space on city owned poles shall be borne by
the provider. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000; amd. 2003 Code)
   E.   Taxes, Assessments: To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city, on the use of the city
property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights of way,
the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such
taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such
payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this
chapter.
   F.   Interest On Late Payments: In the event that any payment is not
actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the
franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the
rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
   G.   Acceptance Of Fee; Not Construed Satisfaction: No acceptance by the
city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact
the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed
as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.
   H.   Additional Taxes Or Fees Still Applicable: The fee payment is not a
payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically
provided in this chapter or as required by applicable law. By way of example,
and not limitation, excavation permit fees and fees to obtain space on the city
owned poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   I.   Operation After Term; Continuing Obligation And Holdover: In the event
a provider continues to operate all or any part of the system after the term of
the franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with all applicable
provisions of this chapter and the franchise, including, without limitation,
all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period of such
continued operation; provided, that any such continued operation shall in no
way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as a
limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution.
   J.   Publication Costs: A provider shall assume any publication costs
associated with its franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-
17-2000)
7-7-8: INSURANCE, RECORD REQUIREMENTS:

provide proof of the insurance coverage required by the franchise. A provider
shall also indemnify the city as set forth in the franchise.
   B.   Oversight: The city shall have the right to oversee, regulate and
inspect periodically the construction, maintenance and upgrade of the system,
and any part thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the franchise and
applicable law. A provider shall establish and maintain managerial and
operational records, standards, procedures and controls to enable a provider to
prove, in reasonable detail, to the satisfaction of the city at all times
throughout the term, that a provider is in compliance with the franchise. A
provider shall retain such records for not less than the applicable statute of
limitations.
   C.   Records Maintenance: A provider shall at all times maintain:

existing GIS system, of all existing and proposed installations and the types
of equipment and systems installed or constructed in the rights of way,
properly identified and described as to the types of equipment and facility by
appropriate symbols and marks, which shall include annotations of all rights of
ways where work will be undertaken. As used herein, as built maps include file
construction prints. Maps shall be drawn to scale. As built maps, including the
compatible electronic format, as provided above, shall be submitted within
thirty (30) days of completion of work or within thirty (30) days after
completion of modification and repairs. As built maps are not required of the
provider who is the incumbent local exchange carrier for the existing system to
the extent they do not exist.
      2.   Throughout the term of the franchise, a provider shall maintain
complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership
and operations of a provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows
the city at all times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the
franchise. Should the city reasonably determine that the records are not being
maintained in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the
books and/or records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance
with this section. All financial books and records which are maintained in
accordance with the regulations of the FCC and any governmental entity that
regulates utilities in the state and generally accepted accounting principles
shall be deemed to be acceptable under this section.
   D.   Confidentiality: If the information required to be submitted is
proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by federal, state or local
law, upon proper request by a provider, such information shall be classified as
a protected record within the meaning of the Utah government records access and
management act (GRAMA), making it available only to those who must have access
to perform their duties on behalf of the city; provided, that a provider
notifies the city of, and clearly labels the information which a provider deems
to be confidential, proprietary information. Such notification and labeling

shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter or a franchise.

the franchise fee, the books and records of the provider pertaining thereto
shall be open to inspection or audit by duly authorized representatives of the
city at all reasonable times, upon giving reasonable notice of the intention to
inspect or audit the books and records. The provider agrees to reimburse the
city the reasonable costs of an audit if the audit discloses that the provider
has paid ninety five percent (95%) or less of the compensation due the city for
the period of such audit. In the event the accounting rendered to the city by
the provider herein is found to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the
corrected amount within thirty (30) calendar days of written notice, it being
agreed that the city may accept any amount offered by the provider, but the
acceptance thereof by the city shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if
the amount is in dispute or is later found to be incorrect. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-
17-2000)
7-7-9: CONSTRUCTION, TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Compliance Required; Excavation Permit: No provider shall receive a
franchise unless it agrees to comply with each of the terms set forth in this

utilities. A provider shall obtain an excavation permit, pursuant to chapter 8
of this title, before commencing any work in the rights of way.

maintenance, repair, upgrade and removal of the system shall be performed in a
safe, thorough and reliable manner, using materials of good and durable
quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the FCC or any other agency
granted authority by federal law or the FCC to make such determination, that
any part of the system, including, without limitation, any means used to
distribute signals over or within the system, is harmful to the public health,
safety or welfare, or quality of service or reliability, then a provider shall,
at its own cost and expense, promptly correct all such conditions.

diligently obtaining, at its own cost and expense, all permits, licenses or
other forms of approval or authorization necessary to construct, maintain,
upgrade or repair the system, including, but not limited to, any necessary
approvals from persons and/or the city to use private property, easements,
poles and conduits. A provider shall obtain any required permit, license,
approval or authorization, including, but not limited to, excavation permits,
pole attachment agreements, etc., prior to the commencement of the activity for
which the permit, license, approval or authorization is required.

in case of fire, disaster or other emergency, as determined by the city in its
reasonable discretion, cut or move any parts of the system and appurtenances
on, over or under the rights of way of the city, in which event the city shall
not be liable therefor to a provider. The city shall notify a provider in
writing prior to, if practicable, but in any event as soon as possible and in
no case later than the next business day following any action taken under this
section. Notice shall be given as provided in subsection 7-7-3C of this

reasonable written notice by the city or any person holding a permit to move
any structure, and within the time that is reasonable under the circumstances,
temporarily move any part of its system to permit the moving of said structure.
A provider may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the city for
any such movement of its systems.
      4.   Change In Rights Of Way; Obligation To Move System: When the city is
changing a right of way and makes a written request, a provider is required to
move or remove its system from the right of way, without cost to the city, to
the extent provided in the excavation ordinance, as provided in chapter 8 of
this title. This obligation does not apply to systems originally located on
private property pursuant to a private easement, which property was later
incorporated into the rights of way, if that private easement grants a superior
vested right. This obligation exists whether or not the provider has obtained
an excavation permit.
   E.   Protection Of Structures, Landmarks: In connection with the
construction, maintenance, repair, upgrade or removal of the system, a provider
shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures
belonging to the city and all designated landmarks, as well as all other
structures within any designated landmark district. A provider shall obtain the
prior written consent of the city to alter any water main, power facility,
sewerage or drainage system, or any other city structure on, over or under the
rights of way of the city required because of the presence of the system. Any
such alteration shall be made by the city or its designee on a reimbursable
basis. A provider agrees that it shall be liable for the costs incurred by the
city to replace or repair and restore to its prior condition in a manner as may
be reasonably specified by the city, any municipal structure or any other
rights of way of the city involved in the construction, maintenance, repair,
upgrade or removal of the system that may become disturbed or damaged as a
result of any work thereon by or on behalf of a provider pursuant to the
franchise.
   F.   Obstructions Prohibited: In connection with the construction,
maintenance, upgrade, repair or removal of the system, a provider shall not
unreasonably obstruct the rights of way of fixed guideway systems, railways,
passenger travel or other traffic to, from or within the city without the prior
consent of the appropriate authorities.
   G.   Safety Precautions: A provider shall, at its own cost and expense,
undertake all necessary and appropriate efforts to prevent accidents at its
work sites, including the placing and maintenance of proper guards, fences,
barricades, security personnel and suitable and sufficient lighting, and such
other requirements prescribed by OSHA and Utah OSHA. A provider shall comply
with all applicable federal, state and local requirements, including, but not
limited to, the national electrical safety code.
   H.   Repair Of Rights Of Way: After written reasonable notice to the
provider, unless, in the sole determination of the city, an eminent danger
exists, any rights of way within the city which are disturbed or damaged during
the construction, maintenance or reconstruction by a provider of its system may
be repaired by the city at the provider's expense, to a condition as good as
that prevailing before such work was commenced. Upon doing so, the city shall
submit to such a provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and
restoring the rights of ways intruded upon. The provider shall, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the statement, pay to the city the entire amount
thereof.

engineering practices and shall conform, when applicable, with the national
electrical safety code and all applicable other federal, state and local laws
or regulations.
      3.   At all reasonable times, permit examination by any duly authorized
representative of the city of the system and its effect on the rights of way.
   J.   Trimming Trees; Authority: With prior written approval of the city, a
provider shall have the authority to trim trees, in accordance with all
applicable utility restrictions, ordinance and easement restrictions, upon and
hanging over rights of way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from
coming into contact with its system. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)

Before entering onto any private property, a provider shall make a good faith
attempt to contact the property owners in advance and describe the work to be
performed. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-17-2000)

or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, such that
it or its successor entity is obligated to inform or seek the approval of the

affirming the transfer of the franchise to the successor entity. If the city
has good cause to believe that the successor entity may not comply with this
chapter or the franchise agreement, it may require an application for the
transfer. The application shall comply with section
7-7-6 of this chapter.
      3.   PSC Approval No Longer Required: If the PSC no longer exists or if
its regulations or state law no longer require approval of transactions
described in subsection A of this section, and the city has good cause to
believe that the successor entity may not comply with this chapter or the
franchise agreement, it may require an application. The application shall
comply with section
7-7-6 of this chapter.

subsection A of this section:

chapter shall contain appropriate provisions for enforcement, compensation and
protection of the public, consistent with the other provisions of this chapter,
including, but not limited to, defining events of default, procedures for
accessing the bond/security fund and rights of termination or revocation.
   B.   Force Majeure: In the event a provider's performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise is
prevented by a cause or event not within a provider's control, such inability
to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this subsection, causes or
events not within the control of a provider shall include, without limitation,

of a franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, the city shall have discretion
to permit a provider to continue to operate its system or provide services for
an extended period of time not to exceed six (6) months from the date of such
expiration or revocation. A provider shall continue to operate its system under
the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant to
this chapter.
      2.   Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier; Negotiate Renewal: If the provider
is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall be permitted to continue to
operate its system and provide services while reasonable efforts are made to
negotiate a renewal in good faith, but in no case longer than six (6) months
after revocation or expiration of the franchise.
   D.   Removal Or Abandonment Of Franchise Property:
      1.   Abandoned System: In the event that: a) the use of any portion of
the system is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, and
thirty (30) days after no response to written notice from the city to the last
known address of provider; b) any system has been installed in the rights of
way without complying with the requirements of this chapter or franchise; or c)
the provisions of subsection 7-7-5D of this chapter are applicable and no
franchise is granted, a provider, except the provider who is an incumbent local
exchange carrier, shall be deemed to have abandoned such system.
      2.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The city, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,
any system, or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained
under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise
provided in this chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the
abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any
affected rights of way to their former state at the time such system was
installed so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights of way in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to such removal, without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,
poles or attachments. The city shall have the right to inspect and approve the
condition of the rights of way, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to
and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this

which a franchise is granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as
provided for by this chapter, in any such case without renewal, extension or
transfer, the city shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its
expense, all aboveground portions of a system from the rights of way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall
not be required to remove its system for a period of six (6) months if
reasonable efforts are being made to negotiate a renewal in good faith.
      5.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights of
way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other
person, and the approval is granted in writing by the city. (Ord. 2000-39, 10-
17-2000)
7-7-13: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter is held by any federal, state or local court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or
state statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in any way in order to
conform to the requirements of any such law and all appellate remedies with
regard to the validity of the ordinance provisions in question are exhausted,
such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct and independent part of
this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability
of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law is subsequently
repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision which
had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, the
provision in question shall return to full force and effect and shall again be
binding on the city and the provider; provided, that the city shall give the
provider thirty (30) days' written notice, or a longer period of time as may be

facilities in the public way, to consider possible avoidance or minimization of
removal or relocation requirements, and to provide the directive far enough in
advance of the required removal or relocation to allow the person a reasonable
opportunity to plan and minimize cost associated with the required removal or
relocation.
   D.   This obligation does not apply to facilities or structures originally

fixture of a private property owner (such as a motor vehicle, fence, air
conditioning, heating unit, or the like) in order to perform some sort of
construction, maintenance or repair by the permittee; or
      4.   Permanently removing a permittee's equipment or other appurtenances
due to the revocation, termination or nonrenewal of the franchise (if
applicable).
   D.   Existing drainage channels, such as gutters or ditches, shall be kept

it is necessary to block or otherwise interrupt flow of the drainage channel, a
method of rerouting the flow must be submitted for approval by the city
engineer prior to the blockage of the channel.
   E.   The requirements imposed upon the permittee extend to any subcontractor
or independent contractor that the permittee might employee to perform the
tasks pursuant to the permit.

following limits and provisions:
      1.   A minimum of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) combined single
limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury and property damage,
and not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the aggregate. The
general aggregate limit shall apply separately to the permit, or the general
aggregate limit shall be two (2) times the required occurrence limit. The
coverage shall be in the nature of broad form commercial general liability
coverage. The city attorney may increase or decrease minimum insurance limits,
depending on the potential liability of any project.
      2.   All policies shall include the city, its employees, officers,
officials, agents, volunteers and assigns as insureds. Any reference to the
"city" shall include the city, its employees, officers, officials, agents,
volunteers and assigns.
      3.   The coverage shall be primary insurance as respects the city, its
employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers and assigns. Any insurance
or self-insurance maintained by the city, its employees, officers, officials,
agents, volunteers and assigns shall be in excess of the permittee's insurance
and shall not contribute to or with it.
      4.   Any failure to comply with reporting provisions of the policy shall
not effect coverage provided to the city, its employees, officers, officials,
agents, volunteers and assigns.
      5.   Coverage shall state that the permittee's insurance shall apply
separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought,
except with respect to the limits of the insurer's liability.
      6.   Underwriters shall have no right of recovery or subrogation against
the city, it being the intent of the parties that the insurance policy so
affected shall protect both parties and be primary coverage for any and all
losses covered by the described insurance.
      7.   The insurance companies issuing the policy or policies shall have no
recourse against the city for payment of any premiums due or for any
assessments under any form of any policy.
      8.   Each insurance policy shall be endorsed to state that the coverage
shall not be suspended, voided, canceled or reduced in coverage or in limits,
except after thirty (30) days' prior written notice by certified mail, return
receipt requested, sent to the city.
      9.   Each policy shall be endorsed to indemnify, save harmless and defend
the city and its officers and employees against any claim or loss, damage or
expense sustained on account of damages to persons or property occurring by
reason of permit work done by the permittee, his/her subcontractor or agent,
whether or not the work has been completed and whether or not the right of way
has been opened to public travel.
      10.   Each policy shall be endorsed to indemnify, hold harmless and
defend the city and its officers and employees against any claim or loss,
damage or expense sustained by any person occurring by reason of doing any work

less than an A carrier, with a rating of "7" or higher.
   C.   The permittee shall furnish the city with certificates of insurance and
original endorsements effecting coverage required by the permit. The
certificates and endorsements for each insurance policy are to be signed by a
person authorized by that insurer to bind coverage on its behalf. The city
expressly reserves the right to require complete, certified copies of all
required insurance policies at any time. Consequently, the permittee shall be
prepared to provide such copies prior to the issuance of the permit.
   D.   If any of the required policies are, or at any time become,
unsatisfactory to the city as to form or substance, or if a company issuing any
such policy is, or at any time becomes, unsatisfactory to the city, the
permittee shall promptly obtain a new policy, submit the same to the city for
approval, and thereafter submit verification of coverage as required by the
city. Upon failure to furnish, deliver and maintain such insurance as provided
herein, the city may declare the permittee to be in default and pursue any and
all remedies the city may have at law or in equity, including those actions
outlined in this chapter.
   E.   The permittee shall include all subcontractors as insured under its
policies or shall furnish separate certificates and endorsements for each
subcontractor. All coverages for subcontractors shall be subject to all of the
requirements stated herein.
   F.   Any deductibles or self-insured retentions shall be declared to and
approved by the city. At the option of the city, either the insurer shall
reduce or eliminate such deductibles or self-insured retentions as respects the
city, its employees, officers, officials, agents, volunteers or assigns, or the
permittee shall procure a bond, in a form acceptable to the city, guaranteeing
payment of losses and related investigations, claim administration and defense
expenses.

of insurance under the following circumstances:

complied with state requirements to become self-insured. Public utilities may
submit annually evidence of insurance coverage in lieu of individual
submissions for each permit; and
         b.   Said coverage provides to the city the same scope of coverage
that would otherwise be provided by a separate policy as required by this
chapter; or
      2.   The work to be performed under the permit issued to the applicant is

detailed construction schedule for approval. The schedule will address means
and methods to minimize traffic disruption and complete the construction as
soon as reasonably possible; (Ord. 98-14, 6-9-1998)
      5.   Type: The bond shall be in the form of cash or an irrevocable letter
of credit; but the ten percent (10%) warranty portion of the bond shall be in
the form of cash, or its equivalent; and
      6.   Terms Of Expiration: The bond, by its terms, shall not expire until
the city engineer has certified in writing that the promised performance is

officers, employees and agents, any liability or responsibility for damages to
any person injured by or by reason of the performance of any work within the
public way, or under a permit issued pursuant to this chapter; nor shall the
city, its officers, officials, employees, agents, volunteers or assigns thereof

for the cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice, the city may
perform the work, at the discretion of the city engineer, with city forces or
contract forces, or both, and suit may be commenced by the city attorney
against the contractor and bonding company and such other persons as may be
liable to recover the entire amount due to the city, including attorney fees,
on account thereof. In the event that cash has been deposited, the cost of
performing the work may be charged against the amount deposited, and suit

8-4A-8: RATES; PURPOSE:
The purpose of this article shall be to generate sufficient revenue to pay all
costs for the operation, maintenance and debt service of the complete
wastewater system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the
wastewater system in proportion to each user's contribution to the total
loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength (BOD and TSS), volume
and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class). Reimbursement for
any rate or billing errors is limited to one year from the date the dispute is
filed. (Ord. 2018-17, 7-3-2018)
8-4A-9: ANNUAL DETERMINATION OF TOTAL COSTS:
The City or its City Engineer shall determine the total annual costs of
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to
maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment
works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual
cost of operation, maintenance and debt service shall include, but need not be
limited to, labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary
modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency
fund. (Ord. 2002-3, 1-15-2002)
8-4A-10: CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE; DETERMINATION:
   A.   The City or its City Engineer shall determine each user's average daily
volume of wastewater, which has been discharged to the wastewater system, which
shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged
to the wastewater system to determine each user's volume contribution
percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater
shall exclude infiltration and inflow. The City or its City Engineer shall
determine each user's average daily poundage of five (5) day twenty degree
centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand which has been discharged to the
wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of
all five (5) day twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand
discharged to the wastewater system to determine each user's biochemical oxygen
demand contribution percentage.
   B.   The City or its City Engineer shall determine each user's average
suspended solids poundage which has been discharged to the wastewater system
which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all suspended
solids discharged to the wastewater system, to determine the user's suspended
solids contribution percentage. Each user's volume contribution percentage,
biochemical oxygen demand contribution percentage and suspended solids
contribution percentage shall be multiplied by the annual operation and
maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the total volume, flow of the
total five (5) day twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand
and of the total suspended solids, respectively. (1990 Code § 13.08.120)
8-4A-11: SURCHARGE RATE STRUCTURE FOR ABOVE NORMAL STRENGTH WASTES:
The City or its City Engineer will determine the average suspended solids
(TSS), five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand
(COD) and oil and grease loadings for the average residential user, or in lieu
of such a determination, will consider the average residential strength wastes
to be two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/L) BOD5, two hundred fifteen
milligrams per liter (215 mg/L) TSS, five hundred milligrams per liter (500 mg/
L) COD, and fifty milligrams per liter (50 mg/L) oil and grease. The City or
its City Engineers will assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users
discharging wastes with BOD, TSS, COD and oil and grease strength greater than
the average residential user. The surcharge will be sufficient to cover the
cost of treating such users above normal strength wastes. The cost of the
surcharges are as follows:
   A.   Seven cents ($0.07) per pound of BOD over two hundred milligrams per
liter (200 mg/L);
   B.   Seven cents ($0.07) per pound of COD over five hundred milligrams per
liter (500 mg/L);
   C.   Fifty three cents ($0.53) per pound of TSS over two hundred fifteen
milligrams per liter (215 mg/L);
   D.   Five cents ($0.05) per pound of oil and grease over fifty milligrams
per liter (50 mg/L). (1990 Code § 13.08.130)
8-4A-12: SERVICE CHARGE; DETERMINATION:
Each nonresidential user's wastewater treatment cost contributions as
determined in sections
8-4A-10 and
8-4A-11 of this article, shall be added together to determine such user's
annual wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one
class or user and equitable service charge may be determined for each such user
based upon an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of
user. The Governing Body may classify industrial, commercial and other
nonresidential establishments as residential user; provided, that the wastes
from these establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average
residential user with respect to volume, suspended solids and five (5) day
twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand. Each user's
wastewater treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the
rate schedule established by resolution of the City Council. (1990 Code §
13.08.140)
8-4A-13: ANNUAL STATEMENT; SERVICE CHARGE; PENALTIES:
The City shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user's annual
wastewater service charge, or one-twelfth (1/12) of the user's annual
wastewater service charge may be included with the monthly water and/or
wastewater utility billing. The user shall pay a ten dollar ($10.00) late fee
if the payment is not received within fifteen (15) days. The City may add a
penalty of one percent (1%) per month interest on any outstanding balances.
Should any user fail to pay the user wastewater service charge and penalty
within one month of the due date, the City may stop the wastewater service to
the property. (1990 Code § 13.08.150; amd. 2003 Code)
8-4A-14: SERVICE CHARGE REVIEW:
The City shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as
well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage on an annual basis and
will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the service charge
system established herein and to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to
adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works. If a
significant user, such as an industry, has completed "in plant" modifications
which would change that user's wastewater contribution percentage, the user can
present at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Governing Body such factual
information and the City shall then determine if the user's wastewater
contribution percentage is to be changed. The City shall notify the user of its
findings as soon as possible. (1990 Code § 13.08.160)
8-4A-15: ANNUAL NOTIFICATION OF RATES:

bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable
to wastewater treatment services. (1990 Code § 13.08.170)
8-4A-16: PROHIBITED DISCHARGES:
   A.   The discharge of any water containing toxic or poisonous solids,
liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with
other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process,
constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create
any hazard in the receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant, is
prohibited.
   B.   Section
8-4A-5 of this article contains additional requirements covering the use of the
City's public sewers. (1990 Code § 13.08.180)
8-4A-17: SEWER EXTENSION PROVISIONS; APPLICATION; FEES:
   A.   Petition: All persons or groups of persons desiring sewer service
outside of a conventionally subdivided area for which extension of sewer mains
are required may make petition to the City, attaching thereto a map indicating
the property to be served and the streets, alleys, highways or easements in
which the extension line is required to be laid.
   B.   Cost Advanced: The petitioners will advance such an amount as in the
opinion of the City and its engineers will defray the cost of the extensions,
and the City will thereupon have constructed the sewer main extensions.
   C.   Refunds: Refunds to the petitioners for extension of sewer mains will
be made according to the formal policy adopted by the City Council. This policy
to be reviewed from time to time and amended as deemed necessary.
   D.   Line Size: The design, size and depth of sewer mains shall be

8-4A-18: SEWER HOOKUP FEE IMPOSED:
   A.   A hookup fee is hereby imposed as a condition of the issuance of a
building permit for each new connection to the City's sewer (wastewater
collection) system.
   B.   The hookup fee shall be assessed upon and paid by, or on behalf of, the
applicant for the building permit being sought.
   C.   The hookup fee is due and payable prior to and as a condition precedent
to the issuance of a building permit, and is in addition to all other
applicable fees, including any impact fees.
   D.   The amount of such hookup fee shall:
      1.   Be fair and reasonable;
      2.   Fairly reflect the actual (direct) and indirect costs to the City
occasioned by the desired or required connection to the City's sewer
(wastewater collection) system;
      3.   Be based upon and reflective of the number of separate service
laterals required under the provisions of section
8-4A-19 of this article; and
      4.   Be established by resolution of the City Council.
   E.   The City Council is hereby authorized to pass one or more resolutions,

(Ord. 97-25, 6-24-1997, eff. 7-1-1997)
8-4A-19: POLICY REGARDING SERVICE LATERALS:
   A.   The policy of the City regarding the number of separate service
laterals for residential and commercial structures is as follows:
      1.   For one- and two-family dwelling structures, under separate
ownership, a separate service lateral for each dwelling unit is required. The
City Engineer may approve a single sewer lateral to service a two family
dwelling structure when a single service lateral already exists and the
installation of a separate service lateral would require that a street or
roadway that is less than five (5) years old be excavated. If the exception is
approved, a separate sewer lateral will extend to each dwelling structure and
will join together into the existing sewer lateral within ten feet (10') of the
property line. The applicant shall provide a service agreement that is recorded
at the Utah County Recorder's Office. This agreement will run with the land and
indicate that the owners of each dwelling shall be jointly and severally
responsible for any necessary maintenance, cleaning, repair or replacement of
the joint lateral.
      2.   For multiple-family dwelling structures under one ownership,
separate service laterals for each dwelling unit shall be the general rule;
provided, however, that where design dictates otherwise, a common lateral (or
fewer laterals than the number otherwise specified) may be permitted where the
applicant provides adequate documentation and guarantees to assure adequacy of
sewer/wastewater collection and responsibility for payment and maintenance. In
any such case, the Public Works Director, with the advice and recommendation of
the City Engineer, may, in his sole discretion, reduce the required number of
service laterals accordingly.
      3.   For multiple-family dwelling structures under separate ownership,
separate service laterals are required for each unit.
      4.   For commercial structures, separate service laterals shall be the
general rule; provided, however, that in those cases where the design and
expected flow of wastewater from the structure dictate otherwise, the structure
is under one ownership, and only domestic waste will be produced/collected
therefrom, common laterals may be permitted where the applicant provides
adequate documentation and guarantees to assure adequacy of wastewater
collection and responsibility for payment and maintenance. In any such case,
the Public Works Director, with the advice and recommendation of the City
Engineer, may, in his sole discretion, reduce the required number of service
laterals accordingly.
   B.   The City Council is hereby authorized to pass one or more resolutions,
or a series of resolutions, establishing policies and procedures to assist in
the implementation, administration and interpretation of the provisions of this
section.
   C.   The City Administrator is authorized to adopt written policies
consistent with this section and any resolutions authorized hereunder to assist
in the implementation, administration and interpretation thereof. (Ord. 2017-
36, 8-1-2017)
8-4A-20: RESPONSIBILITY OF CITY AND APPLICANT (USER OR DEVELOPER):
   A.   When connecting to the City's sewer (wastewater collection) system, it
shall be the responsibility of the City to inspect connections to the main
line, to inspect the laying of the lateral lines, and to prepare and file site
plans showing the exact location of service connections and laterals.
   B.   It shall be the duty and responsibility of the applicant (user or
developer) to perform hard surface restoration of any paved street or streets
disturbed by cuts made, or to be made, for the purpose of installing sewer
laterals.
   C.   The City Council is hereby authorized to pass one or more resolutions,
or a series of resolutions, establishing policies and procedures to assist in
the implementation, administration and interpretation of the provisions of this
section.
   D.   The Public Works Director is authorized to adopt written policies
consistent with this section and any resolutions authorized hereunder to assist
in the implementation, administration and interpretation thereof. (Ord. 97-25,
6-24-1997, eff. 7-1-1997)
8-4A-21: CITY INSTALLED SEWER STUBS:
In constructing the sewer system and extensions thereof, it may become
practical for the City to install, at frequent intervals, sewer stubs from the
sewer lateral to the property line, even though the owner of the adjacent
property (vacant) has not applied for sewer service, nor paid a connection fee,
all to the end that unnecessary tearing up of streets and inconvenience to the
public will be prevented. In such case, the stub is the property of the City
and no property owner shall have the right to the use thereof, unless the right
of use shall be purchased and paid for. The purchase for such use is fixed as
established in subsection 8-4A-18A of this article, which amount must be paid
prior to the receipt by the applicant of an inspection permit, together with
such connection fees as are otherwise fixed by the City. (1990 Code §
13.08.230)

STORMWATER UTILITY
SECTION:
8-5-1: Purpose
8-5-2: Definitions
8-5-3: Stormwater Utility
8-5-4: Stormwater Utility Fee
8-5-5: Billing
8-5-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
City and its inhabitants by improving the City stormwater system, managing and
controlling stormwater runoff, protecting property, preventing polluted waters
from entering the City water supply and other receiving waters, and
establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction, operation
and maintenance of the stormwater system. (Ord. 97-26, 6-24-1997, eff. 10-1-
1997)
8-5-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases shall be defined as follows:
DEVELOPED PARCEL: Any parcel that has been altered from its natural condition
by grading, filling, or the construction of improvements or other impervious
surfaces.
EQUIVALENT SERVICE UNIT (ESU): The average amount of impervious surface,
expressed in square feet, on developed single-family residential parcels in
Pleasant Grove City.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE: Any hard surface, other than the natural surface, that
prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil, or that causes water
to run off the surface in greater quantities or at a greater rates of flow than
the natural surface. (Ord. 97-26, 6-24-1997, eff. 10-1-1997)
8-5-3: STORMWATER UTILITY:
   A.   Created: The City Council hereby creates and establishes a stormwater
utility as part of the City overall sewer system. The stormwater utility shall
plan, design, construct, maintain, administer and operate the City stormwater
system.
   B.   Enterprise Fund: The City Council hereby establishes a Stormwater
Utility Enterprise Fund to handle all income, expenses and other financial
transactions related to the stormwater utility. All stormwater utility service
charges shall be deposited in the Enterprise Fund. Money in the Stormwater
Utility Enterprise Fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to other
City funds; however, the stormwater utility may pay other City funds for
services and expenses directly attributable to the stormwater utility. The
Enterprise Fund shall be operated according to State law and City policy.
   C.   Facilities And Assets: The stormwater utility shall operate
independently of City operations funded by the General Fund. The stormwater
utility shall have the same relationship to the City as other City utilities,
such as the water utility and the sanitary sewer (wastewater) utility. Upon
creation of the utility, all of the City stormwater facilities and assets
(other than streets and other facilities and assets designated by the City
Council) shall be transferred to the stormwater utility in consideration for
the stormwater utility agreement to take primary responsibility for planning,
designing, construction, maintaining, administering and operating the City
stormwater system.
   D.   Administration: The stormwater utility shall be administered by the
Public Works Director. (Ord. 97-26, 6-24-1997, eff. 10-1-1997)
8-5-4: STORMWATER UTILITY FEE:
   A.   Imposed: Each developed property in the City shall be charged a
stormwater utility fee. A developed property may consist of one parcel, or
multiple parcels, depending on the nature of the development, as determined by
the City Engineer.
   B.   ESU: Based on evaluations included in the City's storm drain master
plan, the City Council finds and establishes that one ESU equals four thousand
four hundred (4,400) square feet of impervious surface area. This number was
determined by finding an average of impervious areas from single family
residential properties throughout the City.
   C.   Fee Calculation: The fee shall be based on the number of equivalent
service units (ESUs) contained in the property or development. The number of
service units will be evaluated according to the type of use as outlined below:
      1.   Single-Family Residential: All properties containing single- family
residential units shall pay one ESU per separate living unit within the
property.
      2.   Multi-Family Residential: The fee shall be the base rate times the
number of separate living units within the property. Clubhouses intended for
use only by the residents within a development will be counted as one ESU. Non-
standard clubhouses may be assessed separate rates in accordance with
subsection C5 of this section.
      3.   Non-Residential: The fee shall be the base rate times the number of
ESUs. The number of ESUs for a non-residential property shall be calculated by
taking the measured impervious area of the property and dividing it by four
thousand four hundred (4,400) square feet.
      4.   Mixed-Use Developments: Mixed-use developments, which contain both
residential and non-residential units within a common area, shall pay the
greater of the amount of one ESU per unit (commercial or residential unit)
times the base rate; or the amount calculated by taking the measured impervious
area of the property and dividing it by four thousand four hundred (4,400)
square feet to determine the property's ESUs, and multiplying that number by
the base rate.
      5.   Exceptions: The City Council may adopt separate rates for other uses
that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule.
      6.   On Site Detention Or Retention: Multi-family, non-residential, and
mixed-use developments with detention or retention systems meeting City
standards at the time of their construction will receive a thirty percent (30%)
reduction in their calculated impact fee.
   D.   Charge Per ESU: The amount charged for each ESU shall be established by
resolution of the City Council.
   E.   Exemptions And Credit: The City Council may establish exemptions and
credits to the stormwater utility fee by resolution.
   F.   Policies: The Public Works Director may adopt policies, consistent with
this chapter, and any resolutions passed by the City Council, to assist in the
application, administration and interpretation of this chapter and any
resolutions related to the stormwater utilities.
   G.   Appeals: Any person or entity that believes that this chapter or any
stormwater utility rate resolution was interpreted or applied erroneously may
appeal to the Public Works Director ("Director"). The appeal shall be in
writing, shall state any facts supporting the appeal, and shall be made within
ten (10) days of the decision, action or bill being appealed. The Director may
elect to hold a hearing on the appeal. The Director shall decide the appeal
within ten (10) days of when the appeal is filed. If the person or entity is
not satisfied with the Director's decision, a further appeal may be made to the
City Council. The appeal to the City Council shall follow the same procedures
as the appeal to the Director. The City Council's decision shall be final and
binding on all parties. In cases where an appeal is successful, reimbursement
for any billing errors is limited to one year from the date the dispute is
filed. (Ord. 2018-30, 11-13-2018)
8-5-5: BILLING:
The City Council finds that the City stormwater system, sanitary sewer system,
culinary water system and solid waste collection system are interrelated
services that are part of a unified City plan to provide for the health, safety
and welfare of the City and its residents. In the regular utility bill for the
property, the stormwater utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the
property. The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the City by the person
or entity paying for the City utility services provided to the property. All
properties shall be charged the fee, regardless of whether or not the owner or
occupant of the property requests the stormwater utility service. Failure to
pay any portion of the utility bill may result in termination of water service.

  subdivision drainage plan.
8-6-1: FINDINGS; STORM DRAINAGE MASTER PLAN ADOPTED:
The city council:
   A.   Has found it necessary and determined that the public interest,
convenience, health, welfare and safety requires that all water generated from,
off and around individual construction, commercial, industrial, and public use
developments and subdivisions be confined and disposed of in a flood control
storm drain system; and (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998)
   B.   Has adopted as part of the city's general plan a storm drainage master
plan as amended from time to time relating to the disposition of surface waters
in a storm drainage system; and (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998; amd. Ord. 2004-16, 7-
20-2004)
   C.   Has found that each area which is proposed to be subdivided, developed
and/or built upon, does in fact generate additional runoff water which needs to
be disposed of in a safe manner, avoiding damage and hazards to the inhabitants
of the city; and
   D.   Has found it is necessary that certain improvements be constructed upon
and/or in close proximity to subdivisions, commercial, industrial and public
use developments, developments and individual construction in order to carry
the surface runoff water to appropriate storage, disposition areas and other
facilities identified in the storm drainage master plan; and
   E.   Has found that the costs of construction of the improvements must be
borne by the subdivision and/or proposed developer and builder. (Ord. 98-34,
12-15-1998)
8-6-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and their
derivations shall have the meanings given herein:
CATCH BASIN: A basin that has a stormwater inlet to trap solids or debris.
DEBRIS: Any rock, dirt, sand, tree or other rubbish, litter, etc.
DETENTION BASIN OR RETENTION BASIN: A depression, or bermed area, designed with
an inlet and outlet that regulates water flow and may allow debris to settle
out of the water, and that is capable of detaining stormwater runoff until it
can either percolate into the surrounding soil, or be discharged at an approved
release rate into a channel, pipe, ditch, street or other conveyance, without
causing damage downstream. The detention basin shall have a discharge into said
facilities as set forth above, however, a retention basin must contain all
generated volumes.
DRAIN INLET: A point of entry into a sump, detention or retention basin, or
stormwater system or conduit, or approved irrigation system.
STORM DRAIN: A closed conduit for conducting stormwater that has been collected
by inlets or other approved means.
STORMWATER: Precipitation such as rain, snow, hail or other naturally occurring
waters, that are not present as groundwater. Once the water percolates into the
soil, it is defined herein as groundwater. Stormwater runoff is water that is
generated by stormwater over land. All other water is defined as being water
that is naturally occurring, and is not stormwater.
SUMP: A formalized structure underground, surrounded by drain rock, that acts
as a detention basin to allow the slow release of water into the surrounding
subsoil. Sumps usually receive stormwater runoff from paved areas such as
streets, parking lots, building roofs, etc. (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998)
8-6-3: OBSTRUCTIONS:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to obstruct or contribute to the
obstruction of the flow of stormwater runoff or nonstormwater runoff into any
sump, retention basin, stormwater channel or storm drain, curb and gutter,
drain inlet, or other associated structural controls that convey stormwater
and/or nonstormwater runoff.
   B.   It is unlawful for any person to cause any obstruction that inhibits
the normal flow of stormwater and/or nonstormwater runoff in any curb and
gutter, unless the obstruction is associated with a street and/or stormwater
improvement project and is authorized by the city engineer or his appointee and
granted with the issuance of a permit signed by the city engineer or his
appointee.
   C.   It is unlawful for any person to cover over any drain inlet for any
reason or purpose. (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998)
8-6-4: DUMPING OR PUMPING:
   A.   It is unlawful for any person to dump or pump, or allow to be dumped or
pumped, into any sump, detention or retention basin, storm drain, curb and
gutter, drain inlet, or other storm or nonstorm water structure that conveys
stormwater and/or nonstormwater, including, but not limited to: any type of
debris, groundwater, petroleum product, chemical, paint, pesticide, herbicide,
heavy metal, acid or base product, solid or liquid waste product, hazardous
waste product, and/or human or animal waste.
   B.   The restrictions set forth in subsection A of this section shall not
apply to the normal runoff of nonstormwater related to domestic home use, as
long as the product in question is used in the manner prescribed by the
manufacturer of the product; for example, lawn watering, washing cars, etc.
(Ord. 2012-2, 1-17-2012)
8-6-5: REDUCTION OF STORMWATER FLOWS:
   A.   The development for which the permit or approval is issued must design
for and calculate the flows and volume, as provided in subsection 11-7-4D of
this code, that will be produced by a 10-year, 24-hour storm for detained flow
and storage, and a 25-year, 24-hour storm for retained flow and storage. In
addition, the maximum allowable discharge from the entire project area or site
shall not exceed 0.15 cfs per acre of gross area of development. The amount of
stormwater exiting the project cannot exceed the amount calculated above, but
may be further restricted by the capacity of existing storm drains or drainage
facilities as determined by the city engineer. Restrictions to the controlled
rate of release will require that detention storage be provided. If no
stormwater collection, irrigation system with allowable capacity, or detention
basins downstream are available, with sufficient unused capacity for the 10-
year storm volume, or any portion thereof, retention of the 25-year storm must
be provided. In any event that retention is the only available source of
stormwater management, in the determination of the city engineer, the soil must
be capable of absorbing the entire volume of water within a three (3) day
period of time, as determined by a percolation test that shall be performed on
the site to be used for retention of the stormwater. All other provisions of
the sizing, improvement and use of retention or detention basins shall conform
in all instances to the provisions of section
10-15-33 of this code. In addition, all provisions of the design of stormwater
systems or control for each development shall conform to the master stormwater
management plan.
   B.   In the instances where the plan describes major stormwater conveyance
channels that are intended to remain in an open, nonpiped condition,
conflicting provisions of this code, requiring that channels, ditches, and
other storm or irrigation water conveyances be piped, shall be waived. (Ord.
98-34, 12-15-1998)
8-6-6: PIPING OF EXISTING DRAINAGE/IRRIGATION FACILITIES:
Any open irrigation and/or drainage ditches which are located within or along
the borders of any proposed development must be piped or otherwise covered as a
condition of development approval, except as provided in section
8-6-5 of this chapter. The developer shall be responsible for the design and
construction of the required improvements. In the event the ditch has been
identified in the storm drainage master plan as needing increased capacity, the
city council may elect to have the city participate in the costs of piping such
ditch. (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998)
8-6-7: PENALTY:
   A.   The violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be a class
C misdemeanor and upon conviction, subject to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. Each day that a violation occurs shall constitute a
separate offense. (Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998; amd. 2003 Code)
   B.   If, as the result of the violation of any provision of this chapter,
the city or any other party suffers damages and is required to make repairs
and/or replace any materials, the cost of repair or replacement shall be borne
by the party in violation, in addition to any criminal fines and/or penalties.
(Ord. 98-34, 12-15-1998)

STORM WATER IMPACT FEES
SECTION:
8-7-1: Purpose
8-7-2: Definitions
8-7-3: Written Impact Fee Analysis
8-7-4: Impact Fee Calculations
8-7-5: Capital Facilities Plan
8-7-6: Impact Fee Schedules And Formulas
8-7-7: Fee Exceptions And Adjustments
8-7-8: Appeal Procedure
8-7-1: PURPOSE:
This chapter establishes the city's storm water impact fee policies and
procedures and is promulgated pursuant to the requirements of the Utah impact
fees act. This chapter establishes impact fees for storm water facilities
within the service area, describes certain capital improvements to be funded by
impact fees, provides a schedule of impact fees for differing types of land use
development, and sets forth direction for challenging, modifying and appealing
impact fees. (Ord. 2004-32, 10-19-2004)
8-7-2: DEFINITIONS:
Words and phrases that are defined in the act shall have the same definition in
this chapter. The following words and phrases shall have the following
meanings:
CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN: The plan required by section 11-36-201 of the act. In
section 11-36-201(2)(e) there is an exception to the capital facilities plan
for cities of five thousand (5,000) or less in population, based on the latest
census. Pleasant Grove City does not meet this exception; therefore, the city
has completed a capital facilities plan in accordance with the act.
CITY: A local political subdivision of the state of Utah and is referred to
herein as Pleasant Grove City.
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any construction or expansion of building, structure or
use, any change in use of building or structure, or any change in the use of
land that creates additional demand and need for public facilities. Development
activity will include residential and commercial users who are not currently
connected to any of the city's public facilities systems, but will locate
within the citywide service area.
DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL: Any written authorization from the city that authorizes
the commencement of development activity.
IMPACT FEE: A payment of money imposed upon development activity as a condition
of development approval. "Impact fee" includes development impact fees, but
does not include a tax, special assessment, hookup fee, building permit fee,
fee for project improvements, or other reasonable permit or application fees.
PROJECT IMPROVEMENTS: Site improvements and facilities that are planned and
designed to provide service for development resulting from a development
activity and are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or
users of development resulting from a development activity. "Project
improvements" do not include "system improvements" as defined herein.
PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE COST OF PUBLIC FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS: An amount that
is roughly proportionate and reasonably related to the service demands and
needs of a development activity.
PUBLIC FACILITIES: Storm water improvements of the city for the citywide
service area.
SERVICE AREA: Refers to a geographic area designated by the city based on sound
planning and engineering principles in which a defined set of the city's public
facilities provides service. The service area for purposes of this chapter
includes all of the area within the jurisdictional boundaries of the citywide
service area, of which a description and map can be found on file in the city.
SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS: Refers both to existing public facilities designed to
provide services within the citywide service area and to future public
facilities identified in a reasonable plan for capital improvements adopted by
the city that are intended to provide service to the service area. "System
improvements" do not include "project improvements" as defined herein. (Ord.
2004-32, 10-19-2004)
8-7-3: WRITTEN IMPACT FEE ANALYSIS:
   A.   Executive Summary: A summary of the findings of the written impact fee
analysis that is designed to be understood by a lay person is included in the
storm water impact fee analysis, which is on file in the city and demonstrates
the need for impact fees to be charged. A copy of the executive summary is
included in the storm water impact fee analysis and has been available for
public inspection at least fourteen (14) days prior to the adoption date
hereof.
   B.   Written Impact Fee Analysis: The city has prepared the storm water
impact fee analysis that identifies the impacts upon the storm water systems
required by the development activity and demonstrates how those impacts on
system improvements are reasonably related to the development activity,
estimate the proportionate share of the costs of impacts on system improvements
that are reasonably related to the development activity and identify how the
impact fees are calculated. A copy of the storm water impact fee analysis has
been available for public inspection at least fourteen (14) days prior to the
adoption date hereof.
   C.   Proportionate Share Analysis: The city must prepare a proportionate
share analysis which analyzes whether or not the proportionate share of the
costs of future public facilities is reasonably related to new development
activity. The proportionate share analysis must identify the costs of existing
public facilities, the manner of financing existing public facilities, the
relative extent to which new development will contribute to the cost of
existing facilities and the extent to which new development is entitled to a
credit for payment towards the costs of new facilities from general taxation or
other means apart from user charges in other parts of the city. A copy of the
proportionate share analysis is included in the storm water impact fee analysis
and has been available for public inspection at least fourteen (14) days prior
to the adoption date hereof. (Ord. 2004-32, 10-19-2004)
8-7-4: IMPACT FEE CALCULATIONS:
   A.   Ordinance Enacting Impact Fees: The city council will, by this chapter,
approve impact fees in accordance with the written impact fee analysis set
forth in the storm water impact fee analysis.
      1.   Elements: In calculating the impact fee, the city has included the
construction costs, land acquisition costs, costs of improvements, fees for
planning, surveying, and engineering services provided for and directly related
to the construction of system improvements, and debt service charges if the
city might use impact fees as a revenue stream to pay principal and interest on
bonds or other obligations to finance the cost of system improvements.
      2.   Notice And Hearing: Before approving an impact fee ordinance, the
city will hold a public hearing and make a copy of the ordinance available at
the Pleasant Grove library and the city recorder's office in the Pleasant Grove
city hall at least fourteen (14) days before the date of the hearing, all in
conformity with the requirements of Utah Code Annotated 10-9-103(2). After the
public hearing, the city council may adopt or reject the impact fee ordinance
as proposed or amend the impact fee ordinance and adopt or reject it as
amended.
      3.   Contents Of The Ordinance: The ordinance adopting or modifying an
impact fee will contain such detail and elements as deemed appropriate by the
city council, including a designation of the service area within which the
impact fees are to be calculated and imposed. The citywide service area will be
the only service area included in this analysis. The ordinance will include: a)
a schedule of impact fees to be imposed for storm water, b) the formula to be
used by the city in calculating the impact fees, or both. A copy of this
requirement is included in the storm water impact fee analysis.
      4.   Adjustments: The standard impact fee may be adjusted at the time the
fee is charged in response to unusual circumstances or to fairly allocate costs
associated with impacts created by a development activity or project. The
standard impact fee may also be adjusted to ensure that impact fees are imposed
fairly for affordable housing projects, in accordance with the local
government's affordable housing policy, and other development activities with
broad public purposes. The impact fee assessed to a particular development may
also be adjusted should the developer supply sufficient written information
and/or data to the city showing a discrepancy between the fee being assessed
and the actual impact on the system.
      5.   Previously Incurred Costs: To the extent that new growth and
development will be served by previously constructed improvements, the city's
impact fees may include public facility costs and outstanding bond costs
related to the storm water improvements previously incurred by the city. These
costs may include all projects included in the capital facilities plan which
are under construction or completed but have not been utilized to their
capacity, as evidenced by outstanding debt obligations. Any future debt
obligations determined to be necessitated by growth activity will also be
included to offset the costs of future capital projects.
   B.   Developer Credits: A developer may be allowed a credit against impact
fees for any dedication or improvement to land or new construction of system
improvements provided by the developer provided that it is: 1) identified in
the city's capital facilities plan and 2) required by the city as a condition
of approving the development activity. Otherwise, no credit may be given.
   C.   Impact Fees Accounting: The city will establish separate interest
bearing ledger accounts for each type of public facility for which an impact
fee is promulgated in accordance with the requirements of the impact fees act
and deposited in the appropriate ledger account. Interest earned on each fund
or account shall be segregated to that account. Impact fees collected prior to
the effective date hereof need not meet the requirements of this section.
      1.   Reporting: At the end of each fiscal year, the city shall prepare a
report on each fund or account generally showing the source and amount of all
monies collected, earned and received by the fund or account and each
expenditure from the fund or account.
      2.   Impact Fee Expenditures: The city may expend impact fees covered by
the impact fees policy only for system improvements that are: a) public
facilities identified in the city's capital facilities plan and b) of the
specific public facility type for which the fee was collected. Impact fees will
be expended on a first in first out (FIFO) basis.
      3.   Time Of Expenditure: Impact fees collected pursuant to the
requirements of this impact fees policy are to be expended, dedicated or
encumbered for a permissible use within six (6) years of the receipt of those
funds by the city, unless the city council directs otherwise. For purposes of
this calculation, the first funds received shall be deemed to be the first
funds expended.
      4.   Extension Of Time: The city may hold previously dedicated or
unencumbered fees for longer than six (6) years if it identifies in writing: a)
an extraordinary and compelling reason why the fees should be held longer than
six (6) years and b) an absolute date by which the fees will be expended.
   D.   Refunds: The city shall refund any impact fees paid by a developer plus
interest actually earned when: 1) the developer does not proceed with the
development activity and files a written request for a refund; 2) the fees have
not been spent or encumbered; and 3) no impact has resulted. An impact that
would preclude a developer from a refund from the city may include any impact
reasonably identified by the city, including, but not limited to, the city
having seized facilities and/or paid for, installed and/or caused the
installation of facilities based in whole or in part upon the developer's
planned development activity even though that capacity may, at some future
time, be utilized by another development.
   E.   Other Impact Fees: To the extent allowed by law, the city council may
negotiate or otherwise impose impact fees and other fees different from those
currently charged. Those charges may, at the discretion of the city council,
include, but not be limited to, reductions or increases in impact fees, all or
part of which may be reimbursed to the developer who installed improvements
that service the land to be connected with the city's system.
   F.   Additional Fees And Costs: The impact fees authorized hereby are
separate from and in addition to user fees and other charges lawfully imposed
by the city and other fees and costs that may not be included as itemized
component parts of the impact fee schedule. In charging any such fees as a
condition of development approval, the city recognizes that the fees must be a
reasonable charge for the service provided.
   G.   Fees Effective At Time Of Payment: Unless the city is otherwise bound
by a contractual requirement, the impact fee shall be determined from the fee
schedule in effect at the time of payment in accordance with the provisions of
section
8-7-6 of this chapter.
   H.   Imposition Of Additional Fee Or Refund After Development: Should any
developer undertake development activities such that the ultimate density or
other impact of the development activity is not revealed to the city, either
through inadvertence, neglect, a change in plans, or any other cause
whatsoever, and/or the impact fee is not initially charged against all units or
the total density within the development, the city shall be entitled to charge
an additional impact fee to the developer or other appropriate person covering
the density for which an impact fee was not previously paid. (Ord. 2004-32, 10-
19-2004)
8-7-5: CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN:
   A.   Capital Facilities Plan: The city has developed a full scope capital
facilities plan for the stormwater system. The stormwater capital facilities
plan has been prepared based on reasonable growth assumptions for the city and
general demand characteristics of current and future users of each system.
Furthermore, the capital facilities plan identifies the impact on system
improvements created by development activity and estimates the proportionate
share of the costs of impacts on system improvements that are reasonably
related to new development activity. (Ord. 2004-32, 10-19-2004)
8-7-6: IMPACT FEE SCHEDULES AND FORMULAS:
   A.   Maximum Supportable Impact Fees: The fee schedules at section
9-3-6 1  of this code represent the maximum impact fees which the city may
impose on development within the defined service area and are based upon
general demand characteristics and potential demand that can be created by each
class of user. The city reserves the right under the impact fees act 2  to
assess an adjusted fee to respond to unusual circumstances to ensure that fees
are equitably assessed.
This adjustment may result in a higher impact fee if the city determines that a
user would create a greater than normal impact on any of the systems. The city
may also decrease the impact fee if the developer can provide documentation
that the proposed impact will be less than what could be expected given the
type of user 3 .
   B.   Rates Established By Rate Resolution: The city reserves the right to
establish the impact fees as established in this chapter by rate resolution or
consolidated fee schedule. In no event will the impact fees established by
resolution exceed the maximum supportable impact fee schedule. (Ord. 2004-32,
10-19-2004)
 
Notes
  1. Fees included in this section are the maximum supportable impact fees
1 which can be assessed. Adjustment to these fees may be made with adequate
  documentation from the developer that the true impact differs from that
  shown.
2 2. UCA § 11-36-202(2)(c,d).
3 3. UCA § 11-36-202(3)(a).
8-7-7: FEE EXCEPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS:
   A.   Waiver For "Public Purpose": The city council may, on a project by
project basis, authorize exceptions or adjustments to the impact fee rate
structure for those projects the city council determines to be of such benefit
to the community as a whole to justify the exception or adjustment. Such
projects may include facilities being funded by tax supported agencies,
affordable housing projects, or facilities of a temporary nature. The city
council may elect to waive or adjust impact fees in consideration of economic
benefits to be received from the developer's activity.
      1.   Procedures: Applications for exceptions are to be filed with the
city at the time the applicant first requests the extension of service to the
applicant's development or property. (Ord. 2004-32, 10-19-2004)
8-7-8: APPEAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   Application: The appeal procedure applies both to challenges to the
legality of impact fees, to similar and related fees of the city and to the
interpretation and/or application of those fees. By way of illustration, in
addition to the legality of the impact fee schedule, determinations of the
density of a development activity or calculation of the amount of the impact
fee due will also be subject to this appeal procedure.
   B.   Declaratory Judgment Action: Any person or entity residing in or owning
property within the city and any organization, association or corporation
representing the interests of persons or entities owning property within the
city may file a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of an
impact fee only after having first exhausted the administrative remedies of
this section.
   C.   Request For Information Concerning The Fee: Any person or entity
required to pay an impact fee may file a written request for information
concerning the fee with the city. The city will provide the person or entity
with the city's written impact fee analysis and other relevant information
relating to the impact fee within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the
request for information.
   D.   Appeal To The City Before Payment Of The Impact Fee: Any affected or
potentially affected person or entity who wishes to challenge an impact fee
prior to payment thereof may file a written request for information concerning
the fee and proceed under the city's appeal procedure.
   E.   Appeal To The City After Payment Of The Impact Fee; Statute Of
Limitations For Failure To File: Any person or entity that has paid an impact
fee and wishes to challenge the fee shall file a written request for
information concerning the fee within thirty (30) days after having paid the
fee and proceed under the city's appeal procedure. If thirty (30) days have
passed after payment of the impact fee and a written request for information or
challenge has not been filed with the city, the person or entity is barred from
filing an administrative appeal with the city or seeking judicial relief.
   F.   Appeal To The City: Any developer, landowner or affected party desiring
to challenge the legality of any impact fee or related fee or exaction may
appeal directly to the city council by filing a written challenge with the
city, provided that the affected party does so in writing within thirty (30)
days after the action or decision to which the appeal relates. If no written
challenge is filed with the city within the said thirty (30) day period, the
affected party may neither process an administrative appeal with the city nor
seek judicial relief.
      1.   Hearing: An informal hearing will be held no sooner than five (5)
nor more than twenty five (25) days after the written appeal to the city
council is filed.
      2.   Decision: After the conclusion of the informal hearing, the city
council, by majority vote, shall affirm, reverse, or take action with respect
to the challenge or appeal as the city council deems to be appropriate in light
of the city's policies and procedures and any applicable law, rule or
regulation.
Any impact fee set by the city council may include the establishment or
calculation of the impact fee applicable to the development activity at issue.
Any impact fee set by the city council may be the same as or higher or lower
than that being appealed provided that it shall not be higher than the maximum
allowed under the city's lawful impact fee rate or formula which is either in
existence on the effective date of the act or as promulgated under the impact
fees policy, as appropriate. The decision of the city council will be issued
within thirty (30) days after the date the written challenge was filed with the
city as mandated by Utah Code Annotated section 11-36-401(4)(b). In light of
the statutorily mandated time restriction, the city shall not be required to
provide more than three (3) working days' prior notice of the time, date and
location of the informal hearing, and the inconvenience of the hearing to the
challenging party shall not serve as a basis of appeal of the city's final
determination.
   G.   Denial Due To Passage Of Time: Should the city, for any reason, fail to
issue a final decision on a written challenge to an impact fee or its
calculation or application within thirty (30) days after the filing of that
challenge with the city, the challenge shall be deemed to have been denied and
any affected party to the proceedings may seek appropriate judicial relief from
such denial. (Ord. 2004-32, 10-19-2004)
   H.   Judicial Review: Any person or entity that has been adversely affected

part of a unified plan to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the
City and its residents. In the regular utility bill for the property, the
transportation utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the property.
Utility payments made to the City shall be credited towards the transportation
utility fee first and the remainder credited towards the other City utilities.
The fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the City by the person or entity
paying for the City utility services provided to the property. Failure of any
person responsible for the payment of City utilities to timely pay the charges
when due shall subject such person to discontinuance of utility services
provided by the City, consistent with City policies regarding termination of

9-3-7: Exceptions And Adjustments
9-3-8: Appeal Procedure
9-3-1: PURPOSE:
This impact fee policy revises and prescribes the city's impact fee policies
and procedures and is promulgated pursuant to the requirements of the impact
fees act, Utah Code Annotated sections 11-36-101 – 401 (the "act"). This
chapter establishes impact fees within the citywide service area, describes
certain capital improvements to be funded through impact fees, provides a
schedule of impact fees for differing types of land use development, and sets
forth direction for challenging and appealing impact fees. (Ord. 2008-13, 5-20-
2008)
9-3-2: DEFINITIONS:
Words and phrases that are defined in the act shall have the same definition in
this impact fee policy. The following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings:
CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN: The plan required by Utah Code Annotated section 11-
36-201 of the act. In section 11-36-201(2)(f) there is an exception to the
capital facilities plan for cities of five thousand (5,000) or less in
population, based on the latest census. Pleasant Grove City does not meet this
exception, therefore, it has completed comprehensive capital facility plans for
culinary water, wastewater, roads, public safety, and parks and recreation
facilities in accordance with the act and adopted on September 3, 2002,
September 18, 2007, and May 20, 2008, as included in exhibit B and any
amendments thereto, which are attached to the ordinance codified herein and on
file in the city office.
CITY: A local political subdivision of the state of Utah and is referred to
herein as Pleasant Grove City (the "city").
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY: Any construction or expansion of a building, structure or
use, any change in use of a building or structure, or any change in the use of
land that creates additional demand and need for public facilities. Development
activity will include residential and commercial users who will connect to the
city's water system.
DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL: Any written authorization from the city that authorizes
the commencement of development activity.
IMPACT FEE: A payment of money imposed upon development activity as a condition
of development approval. "Impact fee" includes development impact fees, but
does not include a tax, a special assessment, a hookup fee, a building permit
fee, a fee for project improvements, or other reasonable permit or application
fees.
PROJECT IMPROVEMENTS: Site improvements and facilities that are planned and
designed to provide service for development resulting from a development
activity and are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupant or users
of development resulting from a development activity. "Project improvements" do
not include "system improvements", as defined in this section.
PROPORTIONATE SHARE: Proportionate share of the cost of public facility
improvements, means an amount that is roughly proportionate and reasonably
related to the service demands and needs of a development activity.
PUBLIC FACILITIES: Culinary water, wastewater, roads, public safety and parks
and recreation improvements of the city for the citywide service area.
SERVICE AREA: A geographic area designated by the city based on sound planning
or engineering principles in which a defined set of the city's public
facilities provides service. The service area for purposes of the citywide
impact fee analysis includes all of the areas within the jurisdictional
boundaries of the city (exhibit A, map of the Pleasant Grove citywide service
area, which is attached to the ordinance codified herein and on file in the
city office).
SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS: Refers both to existing public facilities designed to
provide services within the Pleasant Grove citywide service area and to future
public facilities identified in reasonable plan for capital improvements
adopted by the city that are intended to provide service to the Pleasant Grove
citywide service area. "System improvements" do not include "project
improvements", as defined in this section. (Ord. 2002-13, 9-3-2002, eff. 9-3-
2002; amd. 2003 Code; Ord. 2008-13, 5-20-2008)
9-3-3: REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF ANALYSIS:
   A.   Executive Summary: A summary of the findings of the written impact fee
analysis that is designed to be understood by a layperson is included in
exhibit C, which is attached to the ordinance codified herein and on file in
the city office, and demonstrates the need for impact fees to be charged to
fairly show costs related to capital infrastructure. A copy of the executive
summary is included in the impact fee analysis and has been available for
public inspection prior to the adoption of this chapter. (Ord. 2002-13, 9-3-
2002, eff. 9-3-2002; amd. 2003 Code)
   B.   Written Analysis: The city has prepared a written analysis for the
culinary water, wastewater, roads, public safety and parks and recreation
impact fees that identifies the impact upon the individual systems required by
the development activity and demonstrates how those impacts on system
improvements are reasonably related to the development activity, estimates the
proportionate share of the costs of impacts on system improvements that are
reasonably related to the development activity and identifies how the impact
fees are calculated. A copy of the written analysis is included in the impact
fee study and has been available for public inspection prior to the adoption of
this chapter.
   C.   Proportionate Share Analysis: The city has prepared a proportionate
share analysis analyzing whether or not the proportionate share of the costs of
public facilities is reasonably related to the new development activity. The
proportionate share analysis identifies the costs of existing public
facilities, the manner of financing existing public facilities, the relative
extent to which new development will contribute to the cost of existing
facilities and the extent to which new development is entitled to a credit for
payment towards the costs of new facilities from general taxation or other
means apart from user charges in other parts of the city. A copy of the
proportionate share analysis is included in the impact fee study and has been
available for public inspection prior to the adoption of this chapter. (Ord.
2002-13, 9-3-2002, eff. 9-3-2002)
9-3-4: IMPACT FEE CALCULATIONS:
   A.   Ordinance Enacting Impact Fees: The city council will, by this chapter,
approve an impact fee in accordance with the impact fee analysis set forth in
exhibit C: Pleasant Grove citywide impact fee analysis.
      1.   Elements: In calculating the impact fee, the city has included the
construction costs, land acquisition costs, costs of improvements, fees for
planning, surveying, and engineering services provided for and directly related
to the construction of system improvements, and debt service charges if the
city might use impact fees as revenue stream to pay principal and interest on
bonds or other obligations to finance the cost of system improvements.
      2.   Notice And Hearing: Before approving the ordinance, the city held a
public hearing on May 20, 2008, and made a copy of the ordinance available to
the public in the Pleasant Grove City office and library at least fourteen (14)
days before the date of the hearing, all in conformity with the requirements of
Utah Code Annotated 10-9a-203(2). After the public hearing, the city council
may adopt or reject the impact fee ordinance as proposed or amend the impact
fee ordinance and adopt or reject it as amended.
      3.   Contents Of The Ordinance: The ordinance adopting or modifying an
impact fee will contain such detail and elements as deemed appropriate by the
city council, including a designation of the service area within which the
impact fee is to be calculated and imposed. The ordinance will include: a) a
schedule of impact fees to be imposed for each type of system improvement or b)
the formula to be used by the city in calculating the impact fees, or both.
      4.   Adjustments: The standard impact fee may be adjusted at the time the
fee is charged in response to unusual circumstances or to fairly allocate costs
associated with impacts created by a development activity or project. The
standard impact fee may also be adjusted to ensure that impact fees are imposed
fairly for affordable housing projects, in accordance with the local
government's affordable housing policy, and other development activities with
broad public purposes.
      5.   Previously Incurred Costs: To the extent that the new growth and
development will be served by previously constructed improvements, the city's
impact fee may include public facility costs and bond costs related to the
culinary water and previously incurred by the city. These costs may include all
projects included in the capital facilities plan which are under construction
or completed but have not been utilized to their capacity, as evidenced by
outstanding debt obligations.
   B.   Developer Credits: Development may be allowed a credit against impact
fees for any dedication or improvement to land or new construction of system
improvements provided by the developer provided that: 1) it is identified in
the city's capital facilities plan and 2) required by the city as a condition
of approving the development activity. Otherwise, no credit may be allowed.
   C.   Impact Fees Accounting: The city will establish separate interest
bearing ledger accounts for each type of public facility for which an impact
fee promulgated in accordance with the requirements of the impact fees act
deposited in the appropriate ledger account. Interest earned on each fund or
account shall be segregated to that account. Impact fees collected prior to the
effective date hereof need not meet the requirements of this subsection.
      1.   Reporting: At the end of each fiscal year, the city shall prepare a
report on each fund or account generally showing the source and amount of all
monies collected, earned and received by the fund or account and each
expenditure from the fund or account.
      2.   Impact Fee Expenditures: The city may expend impact fees covered by
the impact fees policy only for system improvements that are: a) public
facilities identified in the city's capital facilities plan and b) of the
specific public facility type for which the fee was collected.
      3.   Time Of Expenditure: Impact fees collected pursuant to the
requirements of this impact fees policy are to be expended, dedicated or
encumbered for a permissible use within six (6) years of the receipt of those
funds by the city, unless the city council otherwise directs. For purposes of
this calculation, the first funds received shall be deemed to be the first
funds expended.
      4.   Extension Of Time: The city may hold previously dedicated or
unencumbered fees for longer than six (6) years if it identifies in writing: a)
an extraordinary and compelling reason why the fees should be held longer than
six (6) years and b) an absolute date by which the fees will be expended.
   D.   Refunds: The city shall refund any impact fees paid by a developer,
plus interest actually earned when: 1) the developer does not proceed with the
development activity and files a written request for a refund; 2) the fees have
not been spent or encumbered; and 3) no impact has resulted. An impact that
would preclude a developer from a refund from the city may include any impact
reasonably identified by the city, including, but not limited to, the city
having sized facilities and/or paid for, installed and/or caused the
installation of facilities based, in whole or in part, upon the developer's
planned development activity even though that capacity may, at some future
time, be utilized by another development.
   E.   Other Impact Fees: To the extent allowed by law, the city council may
negotiate or otherwise impose impact fees and other fees different from those
currently charged. Those charges may, in the discretion of the city council,
include, but not be limited to, reductions or increases in impact fees, all or
part of which may be reimbursed to the developer who installed improvements
that service the land to be connected with the city's system.
   F.   Additional Fees And Costs: The impact fees authorized hereby are
separate from and in addition to user fees and other charges lawfully imposed
by the city, and other fees and costs that may not be included as itemized
component parts of the impact fee schedule. In charging any such fees as a
condition of development approval, the city recognizes that the fees must be a
reasonable charge for the service provided.
   G.   Fees Effective At Time Of Payment: Unless the city is otherwise bound
by a contractual requirement, the impact fee shall be determined from the fee
schedule in effect at the time of payment in accordance with the provisions of
section
9-3-6 of this chapter.
   H.   Imposition Of Additional Fee Or Refund After Development: Should any
developer undertake development activities such that the ultimate density or
other impact of the development activity is not revealed to the city, either
through inadvertence, neglect, a change in plans, or any other cause
whatsoever, and/or the impact fee is not initially charged against all units or
the total density within the development, the city shall be entitled to charge
an additional impact fee to the developer or other appropriate person covering
the density for which an impact fee was not previously paid. (Ord. 2008-13, 5-
20-2008)
9-3-5: CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN:
The city has prepared a master plan for culinary water. The plan has been
prepared based on reasonable growth assumptions for the city, general demand
characteristics of future users of the system, and engineering principles.
Furthermore, the plan identifies the impact on system improvements created by
development activity and estimates the proportionate share of the costs of
impacts on system improvements that are reasonably related to new development
activity. (Ord. 2008-13, 5-20-2008)

   CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES
The cost per trip end for standard land use categories will be applied to the
table above for a total impact fee per category of user. The table below is an
example of the derivation of the impact fee per one thousand (1,000) square
feet of floor space for an outlet shop locating within the city. For
nonstandard land uses not shown above, the city will calculate an impact fee
using the formula shown below and replacing "estimated trip ends/day" and the
"adjustment factor" with estimates prepared and documented by the city or a
developer for that specific land use.
 
Step One:
Future growth  / Total trip ends = Impact fee
related costs                      per trip end
$38,488,205.98 / 218,343         = $176.27
 
 
Step Two:
Impact fee   * Estimated     * Adjustment = Impact fee per
per trip end   trip ends/day   factor       1,000 sq. ft.
$176.27      * 26.6          * 21%        = $984.67

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the PLEASANT GROVE CITY
OCCUPANCY PERMIT FEE SCHEDULE. (Ord. 98-26, 10-6-1998)
9-4-2: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   This chapter is intended to assist in the implementation of the city
general plan by providing adequate services to protect the public health,
safety and welfare.
   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to assure that new development pays its
fair share of the cost of providing services which are not initially covered by
real estate taxes. (Ord. 98-26, 10-6-1998)
9-4-3: OCCUPANCY FEE IMPOSED:
A fee is hereby imposed which shall apply to new development of those real
properties located within the city which require the issuance of an occupancy
permit, said fee shall cover the period from the date of issuance of the
certificate of occupancy until and including the ensuing date when the new
development is assessed by the Utah County assessor and placed on the tax roll.
Said fee shall be in the amounts as set forth in exhibit A, which is attached
to ordinance 98-26 and made part of this chapter by reference. The exhibit is
on file in the city office. (Ord. 98-26, 10-6-1998; amd. 2003 Code)
9-4-4: ADJUSTMENT OF OCCUPANCY FEE:
   A.   Disagree With Amount Of Fee Charged: In the event that the fee payer
disagrees with the amount of the occupancy fee to be charged pursuant to the
schedule of fees:
      1.   If the fee payer opts to challenge the occupancy fee, then the fee
payer shall first pay the fee set forth in the schedule of fees, then prepare
and submit to the community development director, within ninety (90) days, the
evidence required below.
      2.   The fee payer, at his option, may submit evidence to the community
development director or his designee indicating that the fee to be paid
according to the schedule of fees is not a fair proportion of the cost of
services which provide benefits to the fee payer's new development. The
community development director or his designee shall adjust the occupancy fee
if substantial evidence is submitted that clearly demonstrates that an
adjustment is necessary under the general methodology upon which the fee is
based. The burden shall be upon the fee payer to provide all relevant data,
analysis and reports which would assist the community development director or
his designee in making a determination. The analysis and reports must be based
upon generally accepted practices and methodologies.
      3.   All decisions by the community development director or his designee
shall be based on the evidence presented by the fee payer, the staff file, and
other relevant evidence. Said evidence must be relevant to the methodologies
and the formula set forth in the schedule of fees. The community development
director shall consider the documentation submitted by the fee payer but is not
required to accept such documentation as he or she shall reasonably believe is
inaccurate or not reliable and may, in the alternative, require the fee payer
to submit additional or different documentation for consideration.
      4.   The community development director or his designee's decision to
adjust or refuse to adjust the fee shall be made in writing.
   B.   Authority To Make Adjustments: The community development director shall
have the authority to make such adjustments based upon information submitted by
an applicant and any recommendations from the city engineer.
   C.   Adopt Policies: The community development director may adopt policies
consistent with this chapter and any resolutions passed by the city council to
assist in the implementation, administration and interpretations of this
chapter.
   D.   Further Appeal To City Council: If the applicant, person or entity is
not satisfied with the community development director's decision, a further
appeal may by made to the city council under the procedures set forth in the
administrative challenges and appeals procedure section herein. (Ord. 98-26,
10-6-1998)
9-4-5: COLLECTION, DEPOSIT AND USE:
   A.   Collection By Building Official: The building official shall be charged
with the collection of the occupancy fee, which shall be collected as a
condition prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   B.   Payment Additional: The payment of the occupancy fee shall be in
addition to any other fees, charges or assessments due for the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.

10-2-2: AMENDMENTS:
   A.   Submission To Planning Commission; Petition: This planning and zoning
title, including the generalized land use and zoning maps, may be amended by
the city council after said amendments shall have first been submitted for
recommendation to the planning commission. For the purpose of establishing and
maintaining sound, stable and desirable development within the city, it is
declared to be the public policy that amendments shall not be made to the
planning and zoning title and maps except to promote more fully the objectives
and purposes of this title or to correct manifest errors. Any person seeking an
amendment to the planning and zoning title or maps shall submit to the planning
commission a written petition containing the following information:
      1.   A designation of the specific zone change or title amendment
desired.
      2.   The reason and justification for such zone change or title
amendment, and a statement setting forth the manner in which a proposed
amendment or zone would further promote the objectives and purposes of this
title as set forth in section
10-1-2 of this title.
      3.   A complete and accurate legal description of the area proposed to be
rezoned, or a draft of the proposed title amendment.
      4.   An accurate plan, drawn to scale, showing all areas to be included
within the proposed rezoning, designating the present zoning of the property
subject to the petition, and properties immediately adjacent thereto, i.e.,
properties within one thousand feet (1,000') of the proposed rezoning area.
      5.   The filing fee as established by chapter 4 of this title.
   B.   Public Hearing; Guidelines For Consideration: Upon receipt of a
petition by the planning commission, the commission shall hold a public hearing
in accordance with the provisions of section
10-2-1 of this chapter before submitting recommendations to the city council.
Before recommending an amendment to this title, it must be shown that such
amendment is in the interest of the public, and is consistent with the goals
and policies of the city general plan. The following guidelines shall be used
to determine consistency with the general plan:
      1.   If a parcel rezoning falls within one of the use or residential
density categories indicated on the generalized land use plan map, the planning
commission shall find the proposal consistent with the plan.
      2.   If a parcel rezoning is not consistent with the plan map, the
planning commission will review the plan's written policies to determine
whether the proposal would undermine or conflict with them. If the commission
determines that the proposal does not conflict with or undermine the plan's
policies, it shall find the proposal consistent with the plan.
      3.   In cases where a conflict arises between the general plan map and
general plan policies, precedence shall be given to the plan policies.
      4.   In cases where more than one zoning designation exists on a parcel,
and where new development is proposed, the following shall apply:
         a.   If all zoning designations comply with the city's general plan
land use map, the regulations of the dominant zoning (covering a majority of
the total land area of the parcel) shall apply. The land area designated as the
grove zone shall be exempt from this rule. For such parcels in the grove zone,
refer to section
10-14-11 of this title regarding this subject;
         b.   If any nondominant zoning designations on a parcel do not comply
with the city's general plan land use map, the applicant shall initiate a
rezone process to consider establishing one zone for the entirety of the
parcel. A rezone of the noncompliant area(s) of the parcel must occur prior to
the approval of a development site plan.
      5.   In cases where no new development, additions or significant changes
are proposed on a parcel having more than one zoning designation, the
provisions of chapter 17, "Nonconforming Uses", of this title shall apply.
   C.   Nonrefundable Fee: The fee provided herein shall not be returnable and
shall be applied to the general fund to offset the cost of legal publications,
notification of property owners, and the staff time involved in researching the
appropriateness of said request and its effect upon the general welfare of the
community. (Ord. 2009-9, 4-7-2009)

the public interest, where owing to the special conditions the literal
enforcement of the provisions of this title will result in unnecessary
hardship; provided, that the spirit of this title shall be observed and
substantial justice done. Before any variance may be authorized, however, it
shall be shown that:

zoning and that adherence to the strict letter of this title will cause
unnecessary difficulties and hardships.

the application that do not generally apply to other properties in the same
neighborhood.

be filed with the Hearings Officer. Said application shall contain the
following information:
      1.   A description of the requested variance, together with a designation

   F.   Unlawful Uses: Any use contrary to the conditional use permit or any
use prior to obtaining such a permit when one is required under this title or
any use inconsistent with the conditional use permit after it has been issued

enforcement officer may, within the scope of the officer's duties, enter onto a
property, investigate any complaint alleging a violation of this title and take
such action as is warranted in accordance with the procedures and provisions
set forth in this chapter.
   C.   Violations: In the event any provision of this title is violated or is
intended to be violated, an enforcement officer may do one or more of the
following:
      1.   Notify (using methods reasonable under the circumstances and if
notification does not hinder the effective enforcement of the provisions of

10-3-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means for timely
abatement of code enforcement violations in order to protect the health and
safety of the public, to foster neighborhood stability, to preserve the
appearance, character and beauty of neighborhoods, to encourage community
pride, to preserve the value of property, and to protect the general welfare of
the city and its citizens, businesses and visitors. This chapter provides for
progressive enforcement measures to abate violations; the most aggressive forms
of enforcement are generally reserved for the most recalcitrant violators.
   B.   Applicability: The provisions of this chapter may be applied to any
violation of this code.
   C.   Existing Law Continued: The provisions of this chapter do not
invalidate any other title or ordinance, but shall be read in conjunction with
those titles and ordinances as an additional remedy available for enforcement
of those ordinances.
   D.   Nonexclusive Remedies: Notwithstanding anything contained to the
contrary, the city may proceed pursuant to Utah Code Annotated sections 10-11-
1 through 10-11-4 without complying with any of the provisions of this chapter.
In addition, the city may take any or all of the remedies identified in this
code (administrative, civil or criminal) to abate a violation and/or to punish
any person or entity who creates, causes or allows a violation to exist. The
abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice the right of the city or any person
to recover damages or penalties for its past existence.
   E.   No Mandatory Duty; Civil Liability: In establishing performance
standards or establishing an obligation to act by a city officer or employee,
these standards shall not be construed as creating a mandatory duty for
purposes of tort liability if the officer or employee fails to perform directed
duty or duties.
   F.   Responsibility For Nuisances: The responsible person is responsible for
abating nuisances pursuant to this chapter. Any person, whether as owner, agent
or occupant, who creates, aids in creating, or contributes to a nuisance, or
who supports, continues or retains a nuisance, is responsible for the nuisance
and is a "responsible person" pursuant to this chapter. Every successive owner
or tenant of a property or premises who fails to abate a continuing nuisance
upon or in the use of such property or premises caused by a former owner or
tenant is a responsible person and is therefore responsible in the same manner
as the one who first created the nuisance.
   G.   Service Of Process:
      1.   Whenever service is required to be given under this chapter for
enforcement purposes, the document shall be served by one of the methods of
service provided for in the Utah rules of civil procedure.
      2.   The failure to serve all responsible persons shall not affect the
validity of any proceedings.
   H.   Constructive Notice Of Recorded Documents: Whenever a document is
recorded with the county recorder as authorized or required by this chapter or
applicable state codes, recordation shall provide constructive notice of the
information contained in the recorded documents.
   I.   General Enforcement Authority: Whenever an enforcement official finds
that a violation of this code has occurred or continues to exist, the
appropriate administrative enforcement procedure may be used as outlined in
this chapter. The director, or any designated enforcement official, has the
authority necessary to gain compliance with the provisions of this code. These
powers include the power to issue notices of violation and administrative
citations, inspect public and private property, abate public and private
property, and use whatever judicial and administrative remedies are available
under this code.
   J.   Adoption Of Policy And Procedures: The hearing officer is authorized to
develop policies and procedures relating to the hearing procedures, scope of
hearings, subpoena powers, and other matters relating to the administrative
code enforcement program. The policy and procedures shall be approved by the
city council.
   K.   Authority To Inspect: All inspections, entries, examinations and
surveys shall be done in a reasonable manner based upon cause. If the
responsible person refuses to allow the enforcement official to enter the
property and the violation is not visible from an adjacent property, the
enforcement official shall obtain a search warrant.
   L.   False Information Or Refusal Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any
person to wilfully make a false statement or refuse to give his or her name or
address with intent to deceive or interfere with an enforcement official who is
enforcing the provisions of this chapter.
   M.   Failure To Obey Subpoena: It is unlawful for any person to refuse or
fail to obey a subpoena issued for an administrative code enforcement hearing.
   N.   Recovery Of Costs: The city shall be authorized to recover all
associated costs, fines, penalties, etc., following whatever legal means
necessary. (Ord. 2010-14, 9-21-2010)

10-9A-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The rural residential zone (R-R) is established to provide areas on the fringes
of the corporate area of the city where residential uses may be harmoniously
integrated with incidental agricultural pursuits. This zone is intended to
allow the keeping of farm animals and fowl in conjunction with single-family
dwelling units to an extent consistent with said development, and in proportion
to the amount of land area provided for this purpose. It is intended, at the
same time, to retain land in parcels large enough to provide efficient and
attractive development as urban uses extend in an orderly manner into these
areas. The R-R zone is also intended to accommodate residential developments
which are oriented to an equestrian lifestyle. This would allow the design of a
residential community which could contain noncommercial stables, training areas
and equestrian trails as an integral part of the development. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-
18-2000)

fowl normally kept for personal food production purposes will be permitted in
any lot (parcel) in this zone:
 
Type                                     Maximum Per Acre

      2.   Allowable acreage for the above is calculated by the maximum lot
(parcel) area minus one and one-half (11/2) times the footprint area of the
residential buildings on the lot. Rounding will be conventional, i.e., to the
nearest whole number.
      3.   At least ten thousand (10,000) square feet is required after the
calculation in subsection E2 of this section. For the allowance acreage of less
than ten thousand (10,000) square feet, no animals of the above listed types
are allowed.
      4.   The maximum allowable animals to be kept as pets (including cats and
dogs) on any lot in this zone is a function of reasonable and prudent animal
husbandry.

animal or fowl capable of inflicting harm or discomfort or endangering the
health and safety of any person or property.
      6.   For animal kennels, boarding, breeding, training and grooming, there
shall be no more than ten (10) small animals maintained on the premises.

Certain lots within new subdivisions in the R-R zone may be reduced in area and
width, subject to the following requirements and limitations:
      1.   Only lots being subdivided concurrently with other lots in the same
subdivision plat may be considered in applying lot size averaging regulations.
For example, lots in one plat may not be reduced in size by citing
compensating, larger lots in an adjoining plat or any other plat previously
approved or expected to be approved at a future time.
      2.   These regulations apply only to subdivision plats containing four
(4) or more lots.
      3.   Averaging shall not be permitted if it will result in increasing the
base density of the subject subdivision plat above the base density allowed in
the zone (i.e., the average area of developed lots must meet or exceed the
minimum lot area required by the zone).
      4.   Lot area that cannot be used for building because it is "restricted
acreage" (as restricted by title 11, chapter 8 of this code dealing with
identified sensitive land areas), such as wetlands, steep slopes, etc., may not
be included in the average lot area computation.

will be one and one-fourth (1.25) times the minimum lot area required by the
zone.
      9.   No reduction in standard minimum yard requirements (setbacks) shall
be permitted.
      10.   For any lot being reduced in lot area, the lot width may be reduced
to one hundred feet (100').
      11.   Lots reduced in size shall be dispersed throughout the subdivision
plat. No more than two (2) of any such lots may be located adjacent to any
other lot reduced in area or width whether in the same plat or in an adjacent
plat. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)

   F.   Chickens/Hens (No Roosters): Subject to meeting all the requirements of
this section, chickens/hens are permitted in all residential zones for
personal/family poultry and egg consumption. Chickens/hens shall only be
permitted after applicants visit the community development department and sign
the chicken registry form, pay the required fee of thirty five dollars
($35.00), and also complete an accessory building permit. Chickens/hens shall
not be deemed as household pets. The keeping of roosters is prohibited. The
following requirements shall apply:
      1.   Minimum Lot Size: Chickens shall be allowed on all R-1 zoned lots/
parcels having a minimum lot area of seven thousand (7,000) square feet.
      2.   Number Allowed: Beginning with the smallest lot size of seven
thousand (7,000) square feet, four (4) chickens shall be allowed. The number of
chickens shall not increase until the next threshold in lot size is reached.
For example, lot sizes between ten thousand (10,000) and fourteen thousand nine
hundred ninety nine (14,999) may have up to six (6) chickens. Please see the
table below:
 
Lot Size Minimum Number Of Chickens/Hens

   21,000 +   12
 
      3.   Location: Chickens/hens may have a yard area to roam during the day
outside of the coop structure. This outdoor yard area shall only be allowed in
the designated rear yard or the street side yard for corner lots. The yard area
and coop must be hidden from view from all public streets. Please see
subsection F6 of this section for additional details on screening requirements
for the yard area.
      4.   Coop Structure/Setbacks: Chickens/hens require a coop structure to
house them at night. This coop structure is to provide at least two (2) square
feet of floor area per chicken/hen. If an owner chooses not to allow the
chickens/hens to roam, then a minimum of six (6) square feet of floor area per
chicken/hen is required. Coops must be structurally sound, clean, well
ventilated, and predatorproof. All chicken coops are to be located a minimum of
five feet (5') from the nearest property line, and a minimum six feet (6') from
the primary dwelling. Coop structures shall be a minimum thirty feet (30') from
any neighboring dwelling. Coop structures shall meet the following additional
standards:
         a.   Coop is to have solid walls on all sides, except for opening for
access;
         b.   Must have a solid roof;
         c.   Built to prevent intrusion, including burrowing of all types of
rodents, vermin, and predatory animals;
         d.   Residents wanting to keep chickens must first obtain an accessory
building permit for the coop structure from the community development director
or designee.
      5.   Maintenance: Owners are to maintain coops in a neat and sanitary
condition. Coops are to be cleaned weekly or more often if necessary to prevent
any odors detectable at the neighboring property line. Dead birds and unused
eggs must be removed within twenty four (24) hours or less and shall be
discarded from public view.
      6.   Screening: The yard area in which the chickens/hens roam, and where
the coop is located, are to be screened from any public street. Property owners
may use their existing yard and fencing as long as they meet the requirements
of this section. The intent is to minimize the visual impact as well as provide
containment. To meet this intent, owners must use solid/sight obscuring fencing
materials. If a new fence is required, then residents must first obtain a fence
permit from the community development department prior to installing the fence.
Chickens/hens shall not be permitted to roam outside the screened yard area.
      7.   Feed: Feed shall be stored and dispensed in rodent and predator
proof containers.
      8.   Poultry: Chickens may be used for meat consumption; however, no
slaughtering shall be permitted on site. The disposal of hens that no longer
lay eggs is to also be done off site.
      9.   Enforcement: Chickens/hens shall not be kept on a single-family
residential lot, according to the standards set above, without first obtaining
an accessory building permit from community development. It shall be unlawful
for any person to keep any chickens/hens in a manner contrary to the provisions
of this section. Any such violation shall be an infraction.

with the zoning requirements when they were created. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000;
amd. 2003 Code; Ord. 2004-19, 8-17-2004)
10-9B-6-1: LOT AREA PER DWELLING:
Not more than one single-family dwelling may be placed on a lot or parcel of
land in the R-1 Zone unless the Planning Commission approves a two-family
dwelling with the same density. Duplexes may be constructed on property meeting
this standard without a subdivision. Twin homes, intended for individual
ownership must be subdivided before property sale occurs. (Ord. 2015-40, 10-20-
2015)
10-9B-7: YARD REQUIREMENTS:
The following minimum yard requirements shall apply in the R-1 Zones (note: All
setbacks are measured from the property line):
   A.   Front Yard: Each lot or parcel in the R-1 Zone shall have a front yard
of not less than twenty five feet (25'). In the R-1-7 Zone only, each lot or
parcel shall have a front yard of not less than twenty feet (20').
      1.   Lots located in the "hillside area", as defined by title 11, chapter
8 of this Code, may have front yard setbacks of twenty feet (20') and twenty
five foot (25') rear yards or a front yard of twenty five feet (25') and a rear
yard of twenty feet (20'). The front and rear yard setback may vary between
twenty feet (20') and twenty five feet (25') so long as the total combination
of the setbacks is at least forty five feet (45').
      2.   In new subdivisions, the owner/developer may vary the setbacks
allowing a twenty foot (20') front yard and thirty foot (30') rear yard or
thirty foot (30') front yard and a twenty foot (20') rear yard. The intent of
allowing flexible setbacks is to stagger buildings to create character and
interest, and encourage better design. Such standards must be determined at the
time of subdivision approval and must be reflected in covenants and
restrictions to be recorded at the County Recorder's Office with the recording
of the final subdivision plat.
   B.   Side Yard: Except as provided in subsections C, D and F of this
section, each lot or parcel of land in the R-1 Zone shall have a side yard of
not less than ten feet (10'), the combined sum shall be a minimum of twenty
feet (20'). In the R-1-7 Zone only, each lot or parcel of land shall have a
side yard of not less than eight feet (8'). (Ord. 2009-16, 10-6-2009)

street shall not be less than twenty five feet (25') and shall not be used for
vehicle parking, except such portion as is devoted to driveway use for access
to a garage or carport. The backyard and the side yard that is not contiguous
to the street shall not be less than ten feet (10'). In the R-1-7 Zone only,
the side yard contiguous to the street shall not be less than twenty feet
(20'). The backyard and the side yard that is not contiguous to the street
shall not be less than eight feet (8'). (Ord. 2018-5, 1-16-2018)
   D.   Side Yard Used For Access: When used for access to a garage, carport or
parking area used to satisfy the minimum parking requirements of the zone, a
side yard shall be wide enough to provide an unobstructed twelve foot (12')
paved driveway.
   E.   Rear Yard: Each lot or parcel shall have a rear yard of no less than
twenty five feet (25'). In the R-1-7 Zone only, each lot or parcel shall have a
rear yard of no less than twenty feet (20').
      1.   Lots located in the "hillside area", as defined by title 11, chapter
8 of this Code, may have front yard setbacks of twenty feet (20') and twenty
five foot (25') rear yards or a front yard of twenty five feet (25') and a rear
yard of twenty feet (20'). The front and rear yard setback may vary between
twenty feet (20') and twenty five feet (25') so long as the total combination
of the setbacks is at least forty five feet (45').
      2.   In new subdivisions, the owner/developer may vary the setbacks
allowing a minimum twenty foot (20') front yard, and thirty foot (30') rear
yard or thirty foot (30') front yard and a twenty foot (20') rear yard. The
intent of allowing flexible setbacks is to stagger buildings to create
character and interest, and encourage better design. Such standards must be
determined at the time of subdivision approval and must be reflected in
covenants and restrictions to be recorded at the County Recorder's Office with
the recording of the final subdivision plat. The front and rear yard setbacks
may vary between twenty feet (20') and thirty feet (30') so long as the total
combination of the setbacks is a minimum of fifty feet (50'), except for in the
R-1-7 Zone. (Ord. 2009-16, 10-6-2009)
   F.   Accessory Buildings: Minimum yard and design requirements for accessory
buildings are as follows:
      1.   Rear Yard/Interior Side Yard Accessory Building: Accessory buildings
may be located in a rear yard/interior side yard no closer than six feet (6')
from the dwelling and no closer than three feet (3') from the rear yard or
interior side yard property line, except as required in subsection F2 of this
section.
      2.   Height Considerations: Minimum setbacks from each property line, for
accessory buildings exceeding twelve feet (12') in height, shall be increased
by one foot (1') for each foot of building height in excess of twelve feet
(12'). Refer to the table below:
 
Height Setback
Up to 12 feet                                                  3 feet
13 feet                                                        4 feet

15 feet                                                        6 feet
16 feet                                                        7 feet
17 feet                                                        8 feet
18 feet                                                        9 feet
Up to a maximum height of 25 feet or the height of the primary 10 feet and over
dwelling, whichever is more restrictive
 
         a.   Any accessory structure taller than eighteen feet (18') shall
require conditional use permit approval at a public hearing before the planning
commission.
      3.   Size Considerations: An accessory building shall not cover more than
ten percent (10%) of the minimum lot area of the zone in which it is located
and shall be smaller (incidental) to the main dwelling (the footprint of the
home less the garage). An exception for the size of an accessory structure, up
to fifteen percent (15%) of the minimum lot area of the zone, may be approved
through issuance of a conditional use permit, at a public hearing, by the
planning commission. The footprint of the structure must still be incidental to
or smaller than the main dwelling, and shall still remain subject to all other
restrictions of the zone.
      4.   Design Guidelines: All accessory buildings shall require community
development approval through the issuance of an accessory building permit prior
to installation or construction. In addition to this, a building permit shall
be required if the structure exceeds the square footage threshold as
established in the international residential code (IRC) and international
building code (IBC). All accessory buildings shall adhere to the following
design requirements:
         a.   Permanent buildings have footings and a foundation, and are to be
composed of steel, wood, vinyl, aluminum or cement fiber siding or other
durable building materials as deemed appropriate by the building department
official and the community development director. Any materials such as cloth,
canvas and/or plastic shall not be permitted for permanent buildings.
         b.   Temporary buildings are those without footings or a foundation.
They are designed for quick assembly and take down, and shall be allowed for up
to ninety (90) days. Temporary canopies for events, such as weekend garage/yard
sales, shall be exempt for up to seventy two (72) hours. Temporary commercial
canopies may be allowed through a temporary use permit authorized through city
hall.
         c.   Semipermanent buildings are movable (no footings or foundation)
yet are composed of durable materials such as wood, steel, vinyl, aluminum or
cement fiber siding. These buildings may be allowed indefinitely, however,
shall require an accessory building permit with each new location on the lot or
parcel.
         d.   Accessory buildings larger than five hundred (500) square feet
shall match the primary dwelling with architecturally similar materials,
colors, and details. The construction of structures built of metal, vinyl or
other similar durable materials shall include a wainscot, siding, or similar
architectural feature covering a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of all
building sides (except door areas), made of similar materials or masonry used
on the primary dwelling.
      5.   Corner Lots: Accessory buildings shall not be located closer than
ten feet (10') from the street side property line in the rear yard of a
residential corner lot. Additionally, all accessory buildings must be approved
by the city engineer and comply with section
10-15-10, "Clear Vision Area; Corner Lots", of this title.
      6.   Utility Easements: If the building encroaches upon any easements,
letters shall be submitted in conjunction with a building permit, from all
affected easement holders stating that:
         a.   The easement has been abandoned and vacated by the affected
entity; or
         b.   The easement holder is authorizing the placement of the permanent
structure subject to the superior interest of the easement holder and may be
required to be relocated at the property owner's expense to accommodate such
interest. (Ord. 2015-33, 8-25-2015)

columns and customary architectural features. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
10-9B-9: BUILDING HEIGHT:
No lot or parcel of land in an R-1 zone shall have a main building or structure
used for dwelling or public assembly which exceeds a maximum height of thirty
five feet (35'). Chimneys, flagpoles, church towers and similar structures not
used for human occupancy are excluded in determining height. Notwithstanding
the provisions above, main buildings which exceed the maximum height of thirty
five feet (35') may be approved by the issuance of a conditional use permit
upon findings of no significant loss of light, air and views of surrounding
properties, or where, by reason of topography, one side of the dwelling may
exceed thirty five feet (35').
Accessory structures, in the R-1 zones, shall not exceed the height of the
dwelling or shall have a maximum height of twenty five feet (25'), whichever is
more restrictive. The height is to be based on the measurement of the average
finished grade to the peak of the roof. The maximum height can only be allowed
if the proper yard requirements, found in section
10-9B-7 of this article, have been met. (Ord. 2008-5, 3-4-2008)

suitable landscaping of plants, shrubs, trees, grass and similar landscaping
materials. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
      2.   Minimum, initial landscaping shall consist of lawn grass (seeded,
sodded or hydroseeded) in the front of the residence and at least ten feet
(10') on either side of the residence to the rear line of the main building.
The landscaping shall also include deciduous trees or evergreen trees at least
four feet (4') in height planted so as to average a tree at each thirty foot
(30') interval within the grass area. Deviations from this specified minimum
initial landscaping concept, including xeriscape, can be granted on a case by

   D.   Occupancy Permits: All improvements are to be completed prior to
submitting for occupancy. Occupancy permits must be issued before occupancy of
any structure where a building permit is required. (Ord. 2008-4, 2-19-2008)
   E.   Lot Size Averaging: To allow for better use of land, discourage odd
shaped lots, and to allow for diversity in design and layout of residential
subdivisions, these regulations allow for reduced lot areas and lot widths.
Certain lots within new subdivisions in the R-1-10, R-1-12, R-1-15 and R-1-20
zones may be reduced in area and width subject to the following requirements
and limitations:
      1.   Only lots being subdivided concurrently with other lots in the same
subdivision plat may be considered in applying lot size averaging regulations.
For example, lots in one plat may not be reduced in size by citing
compensating, larger lots in an adjoining plat or any other plat previously
approved or expected to be approved at a future time.
      2.   These regulations apply only to subdivision plats containing four
(4) or more lots.
      3.   Averaging shall not be permitted if it will result in increasing the
base density of the subject subdivision plat above the base density allowed in
the zone (i.e., the average area of developed lots must meet or exceed the
minimum lot area required by the zone).
      4.   Lot area that cannot be used for building because it is "restricted
acreage" (as restricted by title 11, chapter 8 of this code dealing with
identified sensitive land areas), such as wetlands, steep slopes, etc., may not
be included in the average lot area computation.
      5.   No more than twenty five percent (25%) of the lots in a subdivision
plat may be smaller than the standard minimum lot area or lot width required by
the zone.
      6.   Corner lots shall not be permitted to be reduced in lot area or lot
width below the standard minimum requirements of the zone.
      7.   Lot area may be reduced to not less than eighty percent (80%) of the
standard minimum lot area required in the zone (R-1-10, 8,000 square feet; R-1-
12, 9,600 square feet; R-1-15, 12,000 square feet; and R-1-20, 16,000 square
feet).
      8.   The maximum single lot area that may be included within the average
will be one and one-fourth (1.25) times the minimum lot area required by the
zone.
      9.   No reduction in standard minimum yard requirements (setbacks) shall
be permitted.
      10.   For any lot being reduced in lot area, the lot width may also be
reduced to the standard minimum lot width requirement of the next less
restrictive zone. For example, a lot in the R-1-10 zone being reduced in lot
area may be reduced in lot width to eighty five feet (85') which is the lot
width requirement of the R-1-9 zone.
      11.   Lots reduced in size shall be dispersed throughout the subdivision
plat. No more than two (2) of any such lots may be located adjacent to any
other lot reduced in area or width whether in the same plat or in an adjacent
plat.
      12.   No flag lot shall be included in a subdivision plat where lot size
averaging is used.
      13.   Only buildable residential lots shall be included in lot size
averaging. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)

10-9C-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The medium multiple-residential zone (RM-7) is established to provide areas of
the community which shall be characterized by low rise multiple-family and
apartment residential development. This zone is intended to provide an
attractive setting for multiple-family apartments, and one- and two-family
dwellings which will be harmoniously blended with existing and new single- and
two-family structures at locations designated by the general plan. Because of
potentially high traffic density, the city engineer may require a traffic
study. Properties should be located on arterial or collector streets with good
freeway access or within a reasonable proximity which will permit traffic to
use the arterial or collector streets subject to the city engineer's
recommendation and planning commission's approval. A traffic study may be
required to determine appropriate locations. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)

10-11A-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The neighborhood commercial zone (C-N) is established to promote retail
commercial and service uses to serve the daily convenience needs of the
community or surrounding residential neighborhoods. Each commercial district
will range in area from five (5) to fifteen (15) acres, depending upon the area
served and the range of specialty shops and services being provided. In
general, the C-N zones will be located from one-half (1/2) to one mile from
each other. It is intended that the C-N zone shall be characterized by a
harmonious grouping of commercial stores and shops that will be architecturally
designed for, and will function as, an integrated unit. Clean, well lighted
parking lots and attractive, well maintained shops with appropriate landscaping
will be characteristic of this zone. Lighting will be of a relative low
intensity and low profile with adequate shielding to protect the surrounding
residential areas. The C-N zone will be located adjacent to major thoroughfares
or collector streets that will provide immediate access for automobile traffic
without passing through residential areas. Typical uses allowed in this zone
are grocery stores, variety stores, wide range of restaurants, shoe shops, dry
cleaning pickup stations, self-service laundries, and barber or beauty shops.

      9.   Other Requirements: The planning commission may impose conditions of
approval to regulate the appearance, function and overall site layout to ensure
that the public health, safety and general welfare is preserved and that the
project is developed in a manner consistent with the general plan and
consistent with the purposes of the CS-2 zone.
   C.   Required Building Design:
      1.   Materials: The exterior material of each structure must have a
minimum coverage of eighty percent (80%) of its surface (exclusive of windows
and doors) in either brick, stone or stucco, or a mix of these materials.
      2.   Eaves: Deep eaves, overhangs, canopies and other architectural
features that provide shelter from the elements in winter and shade in summer
will be incorporated in the building wherever feasible.

with forty (40) year architectural grade tile or slate shingles, bonus points
could be granted.
      3.   Multipurpose Stormwater Detention (5 Points): Stormwater detention
facilities are designed and used for multiple purposes which blend with the
overall theme of the open space design, i.e., shape of the area is free
flowing, the grading and landscaping are carried out in such a manner that the
use as a detention pond is not discernible.
      4.   Special Features (5 Points): Special features such as fountains,
streams, ponds, sculptures, buildings or other elements which establish a

10-11E-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The Downtown Village Zone is established to provide a district in which the
primary function of the land is to create a livable and walkable downtown. The
Downtown Village Zone is to foster a revitalization of its commercial/retail
base, while preserving the downtown's historical image, increasing the
livability, and protecting the existing residents' quality of life. It is
further intended to maintain the historical downtown Village image as the
"heart of the City" with which residents and visitors of the City can identify.
This is to be accomplished through two (2) separate zoning subdistricts
(Downtown Commercial Subdistrict and the Transitional Subdistrict).
The Downtown Commercial Subdistrict is intended to be located only in the
central core area of the City and its main objectives are as follows:
   A.   To promote the redevelopment and beautification of properties in
historical downtown Pleasant Grove.
   B.   To allow residential units to be located in the Downtown Village
Commercial Subdistrict Zone while maintaining the street level commercial
character.
   C.   To allow for the creation of a new housing alternative that will
provide individuals with the opportunity to live in proximity to places they
work and shop by creating a more walkable community that has the potential of
reducing the number of vehicular trips per person.
The Transitional Subdistrict is to comprise all other properties between the
Commercial Subdistrict and the boundary of the Downtown Village Zone. Its main
objectives are as follows:
   A.   To function as a buffer between the commercial uses in the Downtown
Commercial Subdistrict and the solely single family residential uses around the
Downtown Village Zone.
   B.   To allow for some limited commercial uses in the area.
The Downtown Village Zone and its subdistricts are to be characterized by
clean, well-lighted streets, ample pedestrian- ways, and vehicular parking lots
for the convenience and safety of the public. Attractive, inviting and well
maintained shops, stores, offices and other buildings are also characteristic
of this zone and are to follow the "Turn of the 20th Century" design theme, as
explained in this article. This will encourage an architectural theme which
will strengthen the continuity of the downtown area and give it "character"
with which the citizens of the City can identify. This zone will discourage the
removal of buildings with historical character, and if these historical
buildings are unfit to occupy or remain intact, then the character of the
building facade is to be integrated into a new building development according
to the design theme for the zone. (Ord. 2017-27, 5-16-2017)
10-11E-1-1: TABLE OF PERMITTED, CONDITIONAL AND ACCESSORY USES:
   A.   Uses Listed Permitted: Those uses or categories of uses as listed
herein, and no others, are permitted in the Downtown Village Zone and its two
(2) subdistricts (Downtown Commercial Subdistrict and the Transitional
Subdistrict).
   B.   Uses Not Listed: For those uses or categories of uses not listed
herein, see section
10-15-2 of this title for establishment of uses not specified.
   C.   Standard Land Use Code: All uses contained herein are listed by a four
(4) digit number as designated in the Standard Land Use Code published and
maintained by the Community Development Department.
   D.   Accessory Uses And Structures: Accessory uses and structures are
permitted in the Downtown Commercial Subdistrict, provided they are incidental
to, and do not substantially alter the character of the permitted principal use
or structure. Such permitted accessory uses and structures include, but are not
limited to, the following:
      1.   Accessory buildings such as garages, carports, equipment storage
buildings and supply storage buildings which are customarily used in
conjunction with and incidental to a principal use or structure permitted in
the Downtown Village Zone.
      2.   Storage of materials used for construction of buildings, including
the contractor's temporary office. Such use must be on the building site or
immediately adjacent thereto. Such use shall be permitted only during the
construction period and thirty (30) days thereafter.

10-11F-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The general commercial (C-G) zone is established to provide a district
primarily for the accommodation of commercial uses and commercial areas which
have been established in locations away from the central core of the city and
which are not within the shopping centers of integrated design. Though this
zone will be applied to areas which have developed as "strip commercial"
developments along major streets and highways, it shall not be used to promote
or establish areas in which such development can be promulgated or encouraged
in violation of good planning principles. The C-G zone should be applied to
vacant land areas for new construction only in the event that integrated
shopping center development is not practical or desirable because of difficult
size, shape, topography or similar problems related to land otherwise deemed to
be appropriate for commercial development. The location of the C-G zone should
be close to major arterials to provide convenient access for major traffic
volumes without hazard and without traversing through a residential area. The
C-G zone shall not be applied to the internal areas of residential
neighborhoods. Although the C-G zone may be applied to existing commercial
areas which have a variety of characteristics, the provisions contained herein
should be used to encourage greater integrity and aesthetic improvements as
these areas are redeveloped, expanded and improved. Integrated and coordinated
landscaping, parking, ingress, and signing and building design should be
encouraged and regulated through the use of project plan approval procedures.
New construction should be in harmony with the characteristics of the
surrounding developed commercial and residential areas. The uses characteristic
of this zone will be a wide range of retail stores, shops, services and
offices. This zone may be applied to areas which have existing offices, heavy
commercial and institutional uses. It is the intent that the C-G zone contain a
mixture of compatible uses. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)

10-12A-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The Business and Manufacturing Park (BMP) Zone is established to provide for a
mixture of research, office, and certain specialized light manufacturing uses.
Light manufacturing uses shall include fabricating, processing, testing,
assembling, packaging and storage associated with the manufacturing of products
which have a high value in relation to bulk, from previously prepared
materials, but not including uses involving primary production of wood, metal,
concrete, asphalt, petroleum or chemical products from raw materials. Such
operations shall not include on site milling, forging, or heavy grinding of
parts or similar manufacturing operations.
The zone, located in the fringe area of the City in open, readily developable
land, is intended to serve as a transitional area between the Grove Zone and
the Manufacturing Zone; therefore, the zone is more restrictive than a
conventional manufacturing zone yet it allows for a number of uses otherwise
prohibited in the Grove Zone. To accomplish the purposes and objectives of this
zone, the following regulations shall apply in the BMP (Business and
Manufacturing Park) Zone. (Ord. 2017-37, 8-1-2017)

10-12B-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The manufacturing distribution (MD) zone is established to provide areas in the
city where light manufacturing firms can engage in processing, assembling,
manufacturing, warehousing and storage; and for incidental service facilities
and public facilities to serve the manufacturing area. The zone is intended to
encourage sound development by providing and protecting an environment for such
development, subject to regulations necessary to assure the orderly growth of
the city, and the protection of residential and commercial land uses from noise
and other disturbances. This zone is to be characterized by flat, open land
suited for industrial uses because of the proximity to major transportation
routes and the availability of utilities necessary for successful manufacturing
or processes. Uses which generate excessive noise, vibration, smoke, odor,
dust, fumes or danger of explosion have been excluded from this zone. The basic
objectives of the MD zone are to:
   A.   Provide space for light manufacturing and processing uses within the
city in appropriate locations and to discourage uses from locating within this
zone which will tend to deteriorate a light manufacturing environment, and
thwart the use of land for light industrial purposes.
   B.   Broaden the tax base and improve the economic base of the community.
   C.   Promote new industry to enhance the economic and social well being of
the city and its inhabitants.

10-13A-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The transit overlay (T) zone is established to provide areas by which a mixture
of residential, office, commercial and related activities can co-exist near a
regional transportation center. The transit overlay allows for a more intense
and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual reinforcement
of public investments and private development. The development standards and
land uses in the transit overlay zone are designed to create a safe and
pleasant environment near transit stations oriented to pedestrians and to those
who rely upon public transportation; yet it minimizes potential conflicts
between vehicles and pedestrians in areas that are more intensely built up with
commercial and other activities. This overlay shall apply only to a zoning
district when a regional transit center is included as part of any proposed
development. The purpose of this article is to establish rules, regulations,
standards and procedures for approval of a transit overlay to:
   A.   Strengthen and sustain the economic potential of the city and to create
jobs;
   B.   Advance and promote sound growth and the general welfare;
   C.   Implement the adopted policies of the city general plan;
   D.   Ensure efficient, safe and aesthetic land development;
   E.   Provide development that is architecturally and aesthetically pleasing
and compatible with the surrounding residential and commercial areas;
   F.   Provide for safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation;
and
   G.   Develop proper safeguards to minimize the impact on the environment,
including, but not limited to, air and water pollution, hazardous waste
contamination and noise levels. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
10-13A-2: ZONE USED IN COMBINATION:
   A.   Required: The transit overlay may be used only in combination with a

   Note:
       1.    Buildings with live-work commercial units in a mixed use
development that abut local or collector roads have unique landscape buffer
setback requirements (see subsection M6 of this section).
      4.   Setback Measurements: Building setbacks are measured from the
foundation to the back of curb. Open structures such as porches, canopies,
outdoor seating areas, covered patios and similar architectural projections
shall be considered part of the building to which it is attached. All street
landscape buffers shall be measured from the back of curb. A minimum five foot
(5') wide landscaped park strip is required between the top back of curb and
the sidewalk.
      5.   Other Buffer Area Requirements:
         a.   Water features, utilizing the creative use of existing
groundwater, are encouraged.
         b.   Consistent width of landscape buffers is highly recommended, but
the developer may achieve this by averaging the minimum required width.
         c.   No fences over three feet (3') are permitted within the street
buffer areas.
         d.   The landscape buffer may not include any paved surfaces with the
exception of a pedestrian sidewalk.
         e.   Xeriscape is encouraged, to achieve more water wise landscape
designs. This type of design is to be submitted to the city by a licensed
landscape architect, and must obtain approval from the design review board.
         f.   The required landscaped buffer width may be reduced no more than
five feet (5'), by the city council, if the developer has provided enhancements
and exceeded the city's standard requirements for architecture, amenities, and
landscaping for the overall project area.
         g.   Landscape buffering area may be interrupted with a gate/
pedestrian accessway to an adjacent site.
         h.   A landscaped buffer area may be used for some forms of passive
recreation; it may contain pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails; provided,
that:
            (1)   No plant material is eliminated.
            (2)   The total width of the buffer is maintained.
            (3)   All other regulations of this code are met.
            (4)   In no event, however shall the following uses be allowed in
buffers: play fields, stables, swimming pools, tennis courts or similar active
recreation uses.
      6.   Landscape Buffer Exceptions:
         a.   A landscape buffer may be reduced to ten feet (10') only if the
following requirements are met:
            (1)   The buffer must be directly in front of buildings that are
live-work commercial units which are part of a mixed use development.
            (2)   The buildings must abut local or collector streets.
            (3)   Vehicle parking designed to service the commercial aspect of
the live-work units shall be the only use permitted between the reduced
landscape buffer and the live-work units.
         b.   Single-family residential lots are exempt from required buffers,
but must still comply with building setback requirements. (Ord. 2015-12, 3-31-
2015)
   N.   Side And Rear Yard Landscaping Buffers:
      1.   Purpose: Without creating barriers, the purpose of landscaping is to
physically separate and visually screen adjacent land uses that are not fully
compatible. The grove district encourages a mix of land uses and does not rely
on a traditional land use map with strict separation of land uses. The
standards established below strive to allow maximum flexibility of screening
and landscaping techniques while providing an appropriate buffer between
dissimilar land uses.
      2.   Applicability: Side and rear yard landscaping buffers shall be
required at all subdivision boundaries (i.e., commercial, industrial, office
and residential, and all commercial, industrial and office developments). All
subdivision buffers must be on a common lot, maintained by a business owners'
or homeowners' association, as applicable. The design review board, planning
commission or city council may waive the requirement for a rear yard landscape
buffer on nonresidential projects, if appropriate.
      3.   Standards: To determine the size of the buffer or transitional yard,
two (2) variables are considered: a) the nature of the adjacent land uses; and
b) the type of buffering. The hierarchy of landscaping buffers is created to
correspond to the degree of incompatibility. An "incompatible land use" is
defined as one that is more intensely developed than its neighbors.
      4.   Land Use Intensity Classifications: There shall be no setback
requirement between properties with the same land use. The recommended
landscape buffer between residential and commercial uses will generally be
twenty feet (20') or more, but if an appropriate fence is approved, the minimum
landscape buffer is five feet (5') on each side of the property line. The
landscape buffer must be located on the property and may not include any paved
surfaces with the exception of pedestrian sidewalks or pathways that cover less
than twenty percent (20%) of the required landscape buffer width. The design
review board, planning commission or city council may approve more or less
buffer.
   O.   Circulation Roads: Internal circulation roads providing access to more
than one property shall be landscaped with street trees and streetside
planters. A minimum ten foot (10') width shall be landscaped adjoining the
right of way of any such street or road. The streetscape planting shall be
consistent throughout the development to provide a unifying landscaping theme.
Details for these areas shall be submitted with the overall landscape plan at
the time of preliminary plan approval.
   P.   Clear Sight Triangle: Clear sight triangle shall be observed in regard
to all vegetation near streets and drives. No evergreen trees shall be planted
within any sight triangle. The maximum height of any berms, fences, signs or
vegetative ground cover at maturity within the sight triangle is three feet
(3').
   Q.   Berms: Berms are required within the landscape areas where the width is
sufficient for development.
   R.   Stormwater Retention: With written permission of the city engineer and
full compliance with standards of the grove zoning district, a required buffer
may include a stormwater retention/detention area.
   S.   Trash Enclosures: Five foot (5') landscaping strips are required around
all trash enclosures except the gate side.
   T.   Monument Signs: Five foot (5') landscaping strips shall be provided at
the base of all monument signs.
   U.   Buffer Walls:
      1.   Where existing or proposed adjacent land uses cannot be adequately
buffered with plant materials, the city may require inclusion of a wall, fence
or other type of screen that mitigates noise and/or unsightly uses.
      2.   Expanses of walls or solid fences that are greater than one hundred
feet (100') shall be interrupted with offsets, landscaping and/or provided with
material accents to prevent monotony.
   V.   Installation And Maintenance: Installation of required landscaping
shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
      1.   All plant materials shall be planted according to industry
standards, using acceptable topsoil and automatically controlled permanent
irrigation systems.
      2.   All proposed plant material shall be in accord with the American
Association Of Nurserymen standards in terms of size, character and quality.
      3.   All plant materials required within a landscaped area shall be
planted to completion prior to the city's issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
      4.   The community development director may authorize a delay in the
completion of planting during the months of October, November, December,
January, February and March due to weather conditions, if a cash bond for one
hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the cost of installation is provided to
the city.
      5.   Maintenance and replacement of required landscaping and screening
shall be the responsibility of the property owner.
      6.   All plant materials shall be pruned, trimmed, watered and otherwise
maintained to create an attractive appearance and a healthy growing condition.
No trees shall be severely pruned or topped.
      7.   Dead, diseased, stolen or vandalized plant materials shall be
replaced by the next planting season.
      8.   Property owners shall keep landscaped areas free of weeds and trash.
   W.   Alternative Methods Of Compliance: It is not the intent of these
landscape requirements to inhibit creative solutions to land use challenges.
Under certain site conditions, a strict implementation of requirements may be
either physically impossible or impractical. Alternative compliance is a
procedure that allows certain modifications to existing regulations within this
section, which may be approved by the planning commission with the
recommendation of the design review board. (Ord. 2013-5, 4-16-2013)
   X.   Parking Lot Landscaping: Interior parking lot landscaping shall be
required for any parking lot with ten (10) or more spaces, including the
following standards:
      1.   Landscaped parking islands are to be as evenly spaced as feasible
throughout the lot with a maximum spacing of one parking island per every ten
(10) parking spaces with a shade tree, and other landscape materials as defined
in this chapter.

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide standards for off
street parking and loading areas that minimize traffic hazards and congestion,
mitigate impacts on surrounding properties, and enhance the overall visual
appearance of the grove zoning district. Parking lots should be designed not
only to accommodate parking needs and facilitate efficient vehicle circulation,
but to also permit smooth pedestrian and bicycle circulation in and around the
lot. Designs should reflect the fact that once people step out of their cars,
they become pedestrians. Clearly defined and well buffered walkways are
integral to good parking lot design.
   B.   Applicability: These standards shall apply to all new development
within the grove zoning district unless expressly modified by the specific
subdistrict standards of this chapter.

10-14-20: URBAN DESIGN STANDARDS:
The standards for buildings and overall site aesthetics for developments within
the grove zoning district are to be reviewed by the city and design review
board (DRB), as listed herein.
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to create and maintain a high
quality of buildings and structures that reinforces the grove zoning district
as the entrance into the city, helping to make Pleasant Grove City a more
desirable place to live, conduct business, and visit.
   B.   Applicability: The standards outlined in the following subsections
shall apply to all new developments within the grove zoning district. For
exterior remodels, these standards shall be applied on a case by case basis as
reasonably applicable.
   C.   General Design Concepts: New development shall be designed for its
specific context to provide quality construction and development in Pleasant
Grove City. Developments containing two (2) or more buildings shall possess a
similar design theme, and the site shall be designed such that the overall
development is cohesive. Building architecture, exterior materials and colors
shall coordinate.
   D.   Compatibility: All commercial developments should be appropriate in
scale, mass and proportion, and be in character with the architectural theme
and color palate of significant adjacent buildings.
   E.   Street Facades: The facade that faces the street is the most prominent
in any commercial building. It shall be designed with large panes of clear
glass on the main level oriented to the sidewalk. Opaque, heavily tinted, or
reflective glass is inappropriate and shall not be used.
   F.   Side And Rear Facades: The design of a building shall be considered on
all sides of the building, with each facade being required to meet the terms of
this section.
   G.   Relief Variation: Commercial buildings shall be designed with
architectural wall relief variations spaced at intervals of thirty (30) to
fifty feet (50') in linear width, depending on the size of the project. At
least four (4) or more of the following architectural features shall be
incorporated into the design of the building: a change in building materials,
building projections measuring at least three feet (3') in depth, roofline
variations measuring at least three feet (3') in height, awnings and lighting,
or another architectural variation that creates visual interest. Relief
variation on single-story buildings shall comprise the full height of the
building.
   H.   Vertical Separation: Buildings in excess of two (2) stories in height
shall exhibit architectural detailing that establishes a vertical separation
between lower and upper stories. This may be accomplished by a mid facade
cornice or trim, a change in material, style or color, a facade relief or roof
pitch with dormer windows, or other methods.
   I.   Building Materials: The majority of each facade (51 percent or more of
the wall excluding windows and doors) shall be constructed of the following
building materials: brick, stone, earth tone colored decorative block, fiber/
cement siding, wood, concrete, or other durable building material as approved
by the design review board and the planning commission. Exterior building
materials shall be limited to no less than two (2) and no more than three (3)
types of materials and colors per building. Stucco, EIFS, metal, or untreated
concrete block (CMU) may be allowed by the planning commission as an accent or
secondary material only. Metal clad buildings, or large sections of stucco or
vinyl siding are prohibited.
   J.   Screening: Mechanical equipment shall be located or screened so as not
to be visible from public and private streets. Screens shall be aesthetically
incorporated into the design of the building, whether located on the ground or
the roof, and may include such treatments as balustrades, parapet walls, or
landscaping. Screening materials shall be compatible with those of the
building.
   K.   Building Architectural Orientation: Buildings shall have their
architectural orientation toward the front of the property, which includes
having at least one functioning entry door oriented to the street. The "front
of the property" shall be defined as the street frontage from which the
building is accessed. Buildings on corner lot sites shall have an architectural
orientation toward each right of way frontage with entrances or the appearance
of entrances along each facade.
   L.   Sustainable Or Green Features: Developments shall include sustainable
or "green" building design features, and shall indicate efforts toward meeting
a minimum level of LEED certification, following the requirements established
by the U.S. Green Building Council.
   M.   Site Design Standards: The following standards address the various
outdoor spaces that form the commercial areas of the grove zone, including its
streets, parking areas, sidewalks, plazas and other outdoor places. These
spaces provide settings for the architecture, and connections to and from the
various buildings. The design of these outdoor spaces shall be of equal high
quality as the buildings themselves, in order to create commercial areas that
are unified and consistent, and for creating a positive image. The following
standards describe the general treatment of important public spaces located in
the grove zone. These standards are intended to provide direction for Pleasant
Grove City, UDOT, property owners, designers, and developers as improvements
are made to public infrastructure and spaces.
      1.   Streets And Streetscape: Each of the streets in the grove zone
contributes to the establishment of a positive place for residents and visitors
alike. The width of the roadway, the number of lanes, on street parking, street
trees and landscaping shape our first impressions of an area. The following
standards address general road and street conditions that are desirable for
commercial developments in the grove zone. Commercial streets and roads should
provide a sense of entry and encourage pedestrian movement and flow.
         a.   Buildings shall have a design that is oriented to the right of
way, including windows, doors and other architectural features, in order to
create an atmosphere of building frontage along the street, except to allow for
required setbacks, landscaped areas, courtyards, plazas, or a drive-through if
the site constraints do not allow for an alternative design.
         b.   Exceptions may be made for large regional developments. Any
smaller out parcels that are a part of a large regional development must be
oriented to the street.
         c.   In the case a project is located adjacent to a state road or
major arterial, a minimum twenty five foot (25') setback shall be required as
measured from the edge of right of way. Landscaping, courtyards, and plazas are
allowed within the required setback; however, a drive-through lane may not be
allowed within the required setback due to site impacts from potential street
widening.
      2.   Pedestrian Circulation And Street Crossings: Sidewalks and walkways
shall extend from building facade to street edge, maximizing the area available
for walking and pedestrian street life. Crosswalks within commercial retail and
office developments shall be constructed with concrete unit pavers or similar
materials, helping to distinguish these zones to motorists. Raised central
median strips, bulb outs and other street embellishments should be considered
on a case by case basis for enhancing the image and safety of commercial areas.
      3.   Connection To Master Planned Trails: Projects adjacent to master
planned trails shall provide hard surfaced pedestrian connections from the
trail into the site.
      4.   Paving And Surface Materials: Sidewalks and walkways shall be
constructed of concrete, and include areas with brick, concrete unit pavers or
similar materials. Color tones should be medium to dark in order to create a
uniform setting for the surrounding building materials and colors.
      5.   Lighting And Furnishings: Streetlights and furnishings shall be
coordinated throughout the development. Furnishings shall be limited to a
select range of benches, trash receptacles, tree grates and bollards.
Streetlights shall be selected from a single model line and coordinate with
other streetlights. Uplighting is encouraged to accent the structures and
provide additional safety.
      6.   Signage: Signs (monument or freestanding) shall be composed of the
same or similar exterior materials as the buildings for which they identify.
      7.   Walls: Where a commercial development abuts an exclusively
residential use, a minimum six foot (6') tall precast concrete or rock masonry
wall is to be installed along the shared boundary. A two foot (2') berm may be
constructed at the base of the wall to give additional screening.
   N.   Parking Lots And Alleys: Parking lots and rear alleys shall be
carefully designed and developed in order to create harmonious and desirable
commercial areas.
      1.   Orientation: Parking lots shall be located to the rear or between
buildings wherever possible. The lots should be broken up into smaller spaces,
utilizing trees to create shading and to provide a level of order and
structure.
      2.   Lighting: Lighting shall be provided in all parking lots, utilizing
attractive poles and fixtures in contrast to nearby streetlights. Fixtures
shall be selected that are night sky friendly, having shielding or other
features that limit upward lighting. See section
10-15-44 of this title for additional exterior lighting requirements.
      3.   Landscape Treatments: Where parking is located adjacent to a public
road, trees and other appropriate vegetation should be used to separate and
define the edges of the parking area from the sidewalk and street. All parking
lots shall be well landscaped according to a detailed landscaping plan as per
subsection 10-14-15X of this chapter.
      4.   Access To Adjacent Uses And Buildings: Well landscaped sidewalks and
paved connections shall be provided between parking lots, nearby buildings and
points of interest. Parking and landscaping areas shall be arranged for
convenient pedestrian access. (Ord. 2016-14, 7-19-2016)

10-14-23: STORM DRAINAGE STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to ensure that all development
provides adequate storm drainage that does not have an adverse impact upon
overall water quality within the area.
   B.   Applicability: Any approved application for a subdivision or
conditional use permit shall be required to develop a stormwater drainage plan
for the site being developed.
   C.   Standards:
      1.   Storm drainage systems shall be designed by a professional engineer
registered in the state. The city engineer shall approve all storm drainage
plans.
      2.   On any site that contains proposed impervious ground cover, a
stormwater detention system shall be required. Such detention system shall
control excess runoff and shall meet the minimum requirements as specified in
the city and Utah County flood control regulations.
      3.   Drainage systems should utilize a combination of open drainage
channels, standard piped systems, grassy swales and stormwater best management
practices (BMPs) to drain the site. Systems should integrate surface drainage
in conjunction with traditional pipe and gutter systems to reduce the amount of
pollutants washing off streets, rooftops and lawns; and to allow stormwater to
percolate back into the soil.
      4.   Stormwater swales, detention and retention facilities may be
incorporated into the landscape buffer areas. (Ord. 2013-5, 4-16-2013)
10-14-24: SUBDISTRICTS:
10-14-24-1: THE GROVE COMMERCIAL SALES SUBDISTRICT:
   A.   Purpose: The grove commercial sales subdistrict is established to
create attractive grove district commercial areas, allowing for a mix of land
uses including office, retail and civic/public, and utilizing the highest
quality architecture and site design. The city council may also authorize
residential uses above the first level of commercial buildings. Development in
this subdistrict should contribute to the creation of a unique "signature
image" for the city that encourages pedestrian activity, social interaction and
a quality shopping experience.

the hazard normally created by any of the uses listed as permitted uses in that
district.
   B.   Public Hearing Required: The planning commission shall, at the same
regular meeting in which they have allowed the establishment of a use in
accordance with the above provisions, set a public hearing in accordance with
section
10-2-1 of this title, at which the planning commission shall determine whether
the use should be recommended to the city council as an amendment to this title

the inclusion of flag lots in proposed new residential subdivisions merely to
maximize the number of lots within the subdivision. Flag lots may be allowed
when it can be shown that there will be no negative impacts to the health,
safety and welfare of the community in regards to providing sufficient street
connections and accessibility for emergency vehicles, and without creating
landlocked situations for neighboring properties.

10-15-28: DESIGN REVIEW:
The city council and the planning commission, which advises the council on
zoning matters, have determined that the various aspects of architectural
design have significant impact on the character and value of the city
neighborhoods and business districts, and that preserving and enhancing this
character requires the existence of a certain harmony and compatibility in
these aspects from one building or dwelling to the next and throughout the
particular neighborhood or district. They have also determined that preserving
and enhancing the visual character of certain entryways to the city, and areas
of unique historical or architectural significance, furthers the economic and
cultural well-being of the community. Additionally, the city finds that these
same benefits should be extended to the entire city. The design standards
outlined below address general design relationships and site planning
principles. They are standards that could apply to any area of the city.
   A.   Construction Activity: The planning commission will review different
kinds of "construction" activity that need design approval; and each kind will
need a slightly different application of the guidelines:
      1.   For the construction of new buildings (including residences) and
parts of buildings, the focus is on the compatibility of new construction with
the existing character (style, size, etc.) of the immediate area.
      2.   For reconstruction, remodeling, addition and repair of existing
structures, this rehabilitation will be done in line with the original
character of the structure.
      3.   For relocation of buildings, those buildings moved to sites must be
compatible with the surrounding buildings.
      4.   For the demolition or removal of all or parts of existing buildings,
compatible replacement structures must be sought.
      5.   For sign permits, the sign is to be designed as an integral
architectural element of the building and site to which it relates, and is
compatible with the overall character of the area.
   B.   Harmony Of Design:
      1.   To preserve the design character of the existing immediate area, to
protect the visual pattern of the community, to protect the value of
surrounding properties and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and
transitions between new and older buildings, new buildings, including
residences, should be made sympathetic to scale, form, size, and proportion of
existing buildings. This can be done by repeating building lines and surface
treatment and by requiring some uniformity of detail, scale, proportion,
textures, materials, color and building form.
      2.   The use of unusual shapes, color and other characteristics that
cause new buildings to call excessive attention to themselves and create a
jarring disharmony shall be avoided or reserved for structures of broad public
significance.
      3.   The height and bulk of new buildings shall be related to the
prevailing scale of development to avoid overwhelming or dominating existing
development.
      4.   Building additions should be designed to reflect existing buildings
in scale, materials and color. Facade renovations should include as few
different materials as possible.
      5.   The architectural style of new or redeveloped structures shall be
compatible with the predominant architectural themes of the district.
Contemporary design for new buildings in old neighborhoods and additions to
existing buildings or landscaping should not be discouraged if such design is
compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
neighborhood, building or its environment.
      6.   Adjacent buildings of different architectural styles shall be made
compatible by such means as materials, rhythm, color, repetition of certain
plant varieties, screens, sight breaks, etc.
      7.   The construction of additions to existing buildings should be
generally discouraged in yards adjoining public streets and should instead be
confined to side and rear yards which are generally out of public view.
      8.   To preserve the continuity prevailing along each block face, the
orientation of the building's principal facade shall complement that of the
majority of buildings in the same block face (either parallel or perpendicular
to the street).
      9.   The open expanse of front lawns and the quantities of planting
within them of new or redeveloped structures shall be comparable to that of
existing structures.
      10.   Projects shall be designed in context with their surroundings. This
means that enough visual linkages between existing buildings and the proposed
project shall be provided so as to create a cohesive overall effect. In
addition to those noted above, visual linkages shall include: window
proportions, entryway placements, decorative elements, style, materials and
silhouettes. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
      11.   Access control. Doors, shrubs, fences, gates, and other physical
design elements should be used to discourage access to an area by all but its
intended users.
      12.   Surveillance should be encouraged by placing windows in locations
that allow intended users to see or be seen while ensuring that intruders will
be observed as well. Surveillance is enhanced by providing adequate lighting
and landscaping that allow for unobstructed views.
      13.   Territoriality should be augmented by the use of sidewalks,
landscaping, porches, and other elements that establish the boundaries between
public, semi-private and private areas.
      14.   Projects should be designed with human scale foremost.
      15.   To promote quality design, stabilize and improve property values
and create a pleasing visual appearance, all buildings with metal exterior
covering may be permitted by conditional use permit in commercial and
industrial zones. The planning commission shall base its evaluation on the
architectural treatment and appearance of the building facade, when visible
from any public street. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. 2003 Code; Ord. 2004-19,
8-17-2004)

within twenty five feet (25') of the nearest residential use/dwelling property
line must have a visual/noise barrier (masonry wall or landscaping) that
completely surrounds the equipment and extends at least one foot (1') above the
equipment. In no case shall the noise from mechanical equipment exceed an
eighty five (85) decibel level. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. 2003 Code)
   I.   Loading Docks: No loading docks, delivery pick up areas, etc., may be
located within fifty feet (50') of a residential use/dwelling property line.
These areas must be screened from public view with a six foot (6') masonry
wall.

Notes
1 1. See also chapter 18 of this title.
10-15-32: TWIN HOME DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Conditional Use; Permitted Zones: Twin home development shall be
allowed as conditional uses in the residential zones, as long as the lot size,
setbacks and frontage requirements for each unit have been satisfied.
   B.   Design:
      1.   To the greatest extent possible, designers of twin homes should
strive for a single-family detached appearance. Instead of looking like a
duplex, where each unit mirrors the other, the homes should be designed so that
they have the appearance of one large unit. This can be accomplished by
separating the entrance of one unit from the entrance to the adjacent unit, or
by utilizing grade changes and roofline variety.
      2.   The primary entrances for one unit including the garage door shall
not be located on the same facade as the other.
      3.   Where physically possible on corner lots, accesses to primary
entrances including driveways and walkways shall not share the same frontage.
   C.   Zones Permitted: Twin homes shall only be permitted in R-1 single-
family residential zones and the RM-7 medium multiple- residential zone. All
requirements of the underlying zone shall be met.
   D.   Off Street Parking:
      1.   Each dwelling shall have not less than two (2) off street parking
spaces, at least one of which is within an attached carport or fully enclosed
attached garage.
   E.   Center Wall: The center wall between the dwelling units shall be on the
property line and shall be designed and constructed for soundproofing with a
maximum sound isolation.
   F.   Fencing: The front yard of a twin home property may not be divided by a
fence but the rear yard may be divided according to each unit.
   G.   Landscaping Plan: Development plans shall include a landscaping plan
for both front and street side yards, which shall be installed by the
developer. CC&Rs shall establish how common landscaping shall be maintained.
   H.   Separate Utilities And Building Drains: Each side of the twin home
shall be separately metered for water and power. Building drains shall be
separate as they leave the building.
   I.   Application For Permit: Application for conditional use permit shall be
made as per section
10-2-4 of this title, and plans shall undergo administrative project plan
review as per section
10-2-9 of this title.
   J.   Plat: Twin home subdivision plats may be drawn as a three (3) lot or
two (2) lot plat:
      1.   A three (3) lot plat shall include individual parcels for the
building pad of each dwelling and designated common area surrounding the
building pads as a third individual parcel. The building footprint parcels
shall meet the minimum front, side, and rear setbacks for the underlying zone.
The combined area of the common area and twin home dwelling parcels shall be at
least twice the minimum lot size of the underlying zone. Development CC&Rs
shall establish how the subdivision common area is to be maintained, or
      2.   A two (2) lot plat shall include individual parcels for each
dwelling with the dividing line separating the two (2) dwellings. Both parcels
shall meet the minimum front, side, and rear setbacks for the underlying zone.
The combined area of the two (2) parcels shall be at least twice the minimum
lot size of the underlying zone. (Ord. 2015-40, 10-20-2015)
10-15-33: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT BASINS:
   A.   Definitions: A stormwater management basin is alternately termed
"detention basin", "retention basin", "debris basin", or "containment basin",
largely depending upon the basin's basic use and upon local preference. In
general, any such basin assists in the management of stormwater by holding
stormwater during times of high runoff rate and then either holding the water
until it subsides or metering the water out of the basin into a stormwater
system at a manageable, reduced flow rate. The basins prevent or at least
mitigate flooding conditions in the city as a whole or in a given neighborhood
or industrial, commercial or residential development.
   B.   Determination Of Basin Parameters:
      1.   The city engineer will determine or certify the design parameters of
each stormwater management basin based upon its capability to provide fill
retention of stormwater runoff within a closed basin having a capability to
hold one hundred percent (100%) of all street and yard runoff from a 5-year,
24-hour storm event with a retained water depth equal to or less than six
inches (6"), and upon the geotechnical study required when new or modified
impervious surface conditions change primarily because of new industrial,
commercial or residential development.
      2.   Design parameters will include the basin total area (including terms
and other details of the basin), basin depth, basin holding capacity and
required basin discharge rate, if any.
      3.   The developer will provide a drainage plan which specifically
defines all surface and underground elements and which shows grading details of
all applicable areas. The plan will identify all paved and unpaved areas and
will specify the flow routing to demonstrate that all runoff will be collected
to the project basins.
      4.   The basin shall be designed with a means of gravity evacuation to
facilitate its availability as a recreation area.
      5.   See title 8, chapter 6 of this code.
   C.   Responsibility For Basin Implementation: All aspects of basin
implementation, including provision of the land the basin will require, the
geotechnical study and report, the basin design for certification by the city
engineer, basin construction following design approval, including all
stormwater collection and discharge conduits and basin landscaping, is the
responsibility of the developer in the case of a new industrial, commercial or
residential development. If the basin is to serve the city in general as in the
case of a large debris basin, the responsibility is that of the city.
   D.   Basin Ownership And Continued Maintenance Responsibility:
      1.   Basin serving the city; such basins, normally several acres and over
ten feet (10') in depth, are public property and are maintained by the city.
      2.   Basin serving a specific residential, commercial or industrial
development:
         a.   Basins having a total area over one acre will be brought to
completion standards by the developer and, upon the final acceptance of the
basin area by the city, the basin will be deeded to the city by the developer.
The city then assumes continued maintenance responsibility (see subsection C of
this section). The basin, depending upon its configuration, may be used by the
city as a playground or recreation area.
         b.   Basins having a total area of less than one acre will be brought
to completion standards by the developer and its disposition for ownership and
continued maintenance can then be in one of the following methods:
            (1)   The developer can sell the basin area to a single adjoining
property owner. The developer must place written conditions on the buyer (a
copy to be filed with the city engineer) that include the following:
Nothing temporary or permanent can be built, stored, erected, located or parked
in the basin.
Only grass (or another suitable ground cover) can be included in the basin's
landscaping, i.e., no trees or shrubbery.
The basin area may, at the owner's discretion, be used as a playground or to
play sports that the basin's area would allow.
            (2)   The developer can offer the basin to the city, who will
determine its residual value to the city versus cost of maintenance. If the
city determines to accept the basin, it will be deeded to the city at no cost.
            (3)   The developer can deed the basin to a neighborhood/
homeowners' association (particularly in the case of a PD where such an
association is required). In this case, the same conditions cited in subsection
D2b(1) of this section must be imposed upon the association with a copy of the
written conditions being filed with the city engineer.
      3.   For various technical reasons, the city engineer may determine a
given basin of any size must be owned and maintained by the city.
   E.   Uses Unlawful: The basin shall not be used as a receiving body or
holding facility for underground or irrigation water or other wastewater which
is not direct storm runoff. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
10-15-34: INDOOR ENTERTAINMENT AS CONDITIONAL USE:
Indoor entertainment, including uses such as dance halls, clubs, roller and ice
skating rinks, theaters, etc., which do not serve alcoholic beverages, when
allowed as a conditional use, shall be approved only in compliance with section
10-2-4 of this title. These uses shall be considered as a conditional use in

10-15-38: FENCING STANDARDS:
The term "fence" shall include any permanent and manmade tangible barrier,
latticework, or wall, with the purpose of, or having the effect of, preventing
passage or view across the fence line. Landscaping and other vegetation shall
not be considered fencing, but may be used as screening material, except as
regulated below. Except fencing defined as "exempt", fence permits must be
obtained from the community development office for the installation of all
fences. The applicant, submitting for a fence permit, shall submit a site
sketch showing the lot, the location of the fence on the lot, the proposed
height(s) of the fence, the elevation of the lot and surrounding properties,
and the location of driveways on the lot and adjacent properties. Any fence,
wall, screen or other material serving as a fence, shall not create a sight
distance hazard to vehicular or pedestrian traffic as determined by the city
engineer. Each landowner shall be permitted to install an approved fence on the
property line. If a fence already exists on the property line, and the adjacent
neighbor wishes to install their own fence, then the additional fence must be
installed as close as possible to the neighbor's fence. Secondary fencing may
be installed subject to the provisions of this section (see subsection K of
this section). Security fencing shall be allowed according to this chapter for
public facilities/lands.
   A.   Front Yard: Solid walls, fences or screening materials which are sight
obscuring may be built to a maximum height of three feet (3') in any required
front yard perimeter. Walls, fences or screening materials (chainlinks are not
allowed) which are not sight obscuring (at least 50 percent open) may be built
to a maximum of four feet (4') in a front yard.
   B.   Side Yard (Interior Lot): Solid, sight obscuring fences or walls may be
built to a height of six feet (6'). In cases where there is a difference in
grade between property lines or it is determined that additional screening is
needed, side yard fences may exceed six feet (6'), up to a maximum of ten feet
(10'), provided, that the applicant first obtains conditional use permit
approval from the planning commission, and second, that a building permit is
obtained from the community development office prior to construction.
   C.   Rear Yard: Walls and other fences in a rear yard may be erected up to
six feet (6') with fence permit approval. In cases where there is a difference
in grade between property lines, or it is determined that additional screening
is needed, rear yard fences may exceed six feet (6'), up to a maximum of ten
feet (10'), provided, that the applicant first obtains conditional use permit
approval from the planning commission and second, that a building permit is
obtained from the community development office prior to construction.
   D.   Corner Lots: A fence not more than six feet (6') high may be
constructed along the perimeter of any required side yard adjacent to a public
street on a corner lot, provided it does not obstruct clear view of
intersecting streets as defined in section
10-15-10 of this chapter.
   E.   Grade Differences: Where there is a difference in the grade of the
properties on either side of a fence, wall or other similar structure, the
height of the fence shall be measured from the natural grade of the property
upon which it is located. In cases where a new development is proposed adjacent
to an existing residential use, the new development is to be the party
responsible for providing suitable screening to help mitigate a difference in
grade between the new and existing residential property, if that grade
difference is greater than three feet (3'). This screening shall be required
with the site or subdivision plat, and shall require conditional use permit
approval from the planning commission.
   F.   Retaining Walls: Where a retaining wall protects a cut below or a fill
above the natural grade and is located on the line separating lots or
properties, such retaining wall may be topped by a fence, wall or hedge of the
same height that would otherwise be permitted at the location if no retaining
wall existed. In such cases, the builder of the retaining wall must obtain
building permit approval from the community development office.
   G.   Multiple Frontage Lots: A minimum six foot (6') tall decorative precast
concrete wall shall be erected along the property lines of a rear or side yard,
of lots in a new development, adjacent to a collector or arterial street, to
help mitigate the concerns with frontage adjacent to these high traffic public
rights of way, and to protect the safety and privacy of everyday family life,
provided that the placement will not result in the establishment of a hazardous
condition to adjacent properties, vehicles or pedestrians, as determined by the
city engineer. The precast concrete wall is to be matching or similar in
design, along the entire street corridor of the collector or arterial, to
establish a standard of consistent visual appearance. Designs for the wall are
to be approved by the community development department director or his/her
designee, through the issuance of a fence permit. The following cases shall be
exempt from installing a wall:
      1.   Multiple frontage lots with existing homes along a collector or
arterial street;
      2.   Multiple frontage lots with existing homes along city streets with
the standard fifty six foot (56') width or less.

development entrances shall not exceed six feet (6') at the highest point,
except lamps on pillars, and must comply with the provisions of section
10-15-10 of this chapter. Pillars shall be allowed to extend up to eighteen
inches (18") above the allowable height of a fence; provided, that the pillars
shall have a minimum spacing of no less than six feet (6'), measured face to
face. The said fence must be set back a minimum of ten feet (10') from the
entry drive, unless a greater distance is deemed necessary by the city
engineer.
   I.   Exemptions: The provisions of this section shall not apply to certain
other fences such as tennis court backstops or patio enclosures as approved by
the community development office, if it is determined that such do not create a
hazard or violation of other sections of the city ordinances. Also, continuous
growth, trees, shrubs, and hedges shall not be considered as fencing, but
screening materials. Hedges and other similar vegetation used as screening
shall be exempt from the permitting process to a height of six feet (6') or
less in the side and rear yards, and up to three feet (3') tall in a front yard
area.
   J.   Large Animals: Where a new development is proposed, adjacent to
property with large animals, the developer is to install a minimum six foot
(6') tall precast concrete or masonry wall, along such boundaries for the
protection of both the animals and the future residents within the new
subdivision. The approval of the wall is to be included with the preliminary
and final subdivision plat approvals, and must meet the design standards as
determined by the community development office. Upon final plat approval, the
city council may waive the requirement for the said wall, if the council
determines there will be no potential hazardous conditions and that any other
concerns are mitigated through the issuance of a conditional use permit.
   K.   Secondary Fence: A second independent fence, within the side and rear
yards, is permitted; however, this second fence must be a minimum five feet
(5') from the property line.
   L.   Maintenance: All fencing within view of the public right of way is to
be well maintained and in good condition to avoid any unsightly views. If the

placement to provide sufficient clear vision for access to the property and
adjacent properties. (Ord. 2011-4, 3-29-2011)
10-15-39: MUD, DEBRIS AND DUST CONTROL:
The problem of mud, debris and dust control during subdivision and all other
construction activity must be contained. The best way to avoid this problem is
for each developer, builder and contractor to police themselves so that the
city does not have to become involved. However, if needed, the city will
aggressively seek to remedy such situations. The following provisions will be
made for the cleanup of city streets and dust control:
   A.   Bond: The improvement or construction bond provided will include
cleanup and dust control.
   B.   Responsibilities: The developer of the subdivision or project is
responsible for cleanup and dust control associated with streets. Builders will
be responsible for cleanup and dust control associated with an individual lot.
However, overall responsibility is still in the hands of the developer.
   C.   Use Of Hydrants: The city will permit the use of hydrants for a hookup
fee and a charge for water used. This will facilitate dust control. (Ord. 2000-
23, 7-18-2000)
   D.   Stop Work Order: If it is determined that excessive debris and mud are
being tracked onto city streets from an individual lot, the city will notify
the builder of the need to clean the street. The city will issue an order
stopping all further inspections on the buildings until the cleanup is
completed. The city may perform the cleanup and bill the builder for the costs
of cleanup. This bill must be paid before further inspections will be
performed. Likewise, if the city determines that excessive mud is being tracked
onto city streets from a subdivision road under construction or other reasons,
the developer will be notified and given the same time period to perform the
cleanup. If the cleanup is not done, the developer will be billed for the cost
of the cleanup and inspections will not be performed on improvements until the
bill is paid. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. 2003 Code; Ord. 2004-19, 8-17-

any future use of the said building shall conform to the provisions of the zone
in which it is located. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
10-17-6: CHANGE IN STATUS OF NONCONFORMING USE:
If a nonconforming use is vacated, it may be succeeded by an equally
restrictive or more restrictive nonconforming use, provided such change is
effected within six (6) months (12 months for animal rights). After a change to
a more restrictive use is in effect, that change shall be evidence that the
less restrictive nonconforming use has been abandoned and thereupon loses any
vested right as such, and the degree of nonconformity may not subsequently be
increased by changing back to a less restrictive use. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
10-17-7: RECONSTRUCTION OF NONCONFORMING BUILDING PARTIALLY DESTROYED:
   A.   A nonconforming building destroyed to the extent of not more than fifty
percent (50%) of its reasonable replacement value at the time of its
destruction by fire, explosion, or other casualty or act of God or public
enemy, may be restored and the occupancy or use of such building or part
thereof which existed at the time of such partial destruction may be continued,
subject to all of the provisions of this title. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
   B.   A nonconforming building that is destroyed more than fifty percent
(50%) of its reasonable replacement value must receive planning commission
approval before being restored. (2003 Code; amd. Ord. 2004-19, 8-17-2004)
10-17-8: NONCONFORMANCE LIMITED TO ZONE GROUPS:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, all uses permitted and
lawfully existing in any zone at the time of the effective date hereof shall be
considered legally nonconforming in the zone in which it is located. This
section shall be applicable only to nonconforming uses. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-

Notes
  1. See also section
1 10-15-31 of this title for provisions regarding off street parking across
  public streets or with intervening property.
10-18-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for off street parking in
order to reduce street congestion and traffic hazards in the City. These
requirements shall be applied at the time of any new construction or at the
time the main building is enlarged or increased in capacity. If any land,
structure or use is changed from one use to another which requires more off
street parking spaces, there shall be provided such additional off street
parking for the new use as is required by this chapter. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-
2000)
10-18-2: PARKING DESIGN STANDARDS:
All off street parking facilities shall conform to the following standards:
   A.   All parking spaces shall be nine feet (9') wide by twenty feet (20')
long as designated on diagram in this chapter, except as provided in
subsections B and G of this section.
   B.   Parking spaces in the Grove Interchange Subdistrict shall be nine feet
(9') wide by eighteen feet (18') long as designated on diagram in this chapter.
   C.   Acute angle parking (30 degree, 45 degree and 60 degree), shall be
designed for one-way traffic only.
   D.   Separate exits shall be provided for acute angle and one-way parallel
parking of four (4) or more spaces so that cars need not exit by backing onto a
street or alley.
   E.   When providing access to a garage, carport or parking area having less
than five (5) parking spaces, a driveway shall be a minimum of twelve feet
(12') in width. Where a driveway provides access to a garage, carport, or
parking area serving as the main parking area for the primary dwelling, said
driveway shall provide paved access to a public street.
   F.   When used for access to a garage, carport or parking area having five
(5) or more parking spaces, a driveway shall be a minimum of twelve feet (12')
in width for one-way traffic or sixteen feet (16') in width for two-way
traffic.
   G.   Tandem parking (front to rear) is permitted only for single- family and
duplex dwellings, when front and back spaces are both designated to serve the
same dwelling unit. Additionally, tandem spaces will be permitted in the
driveway of multi-family dwellings with an attached garage, but may not be
counted toward meeting visitor parking requirements. Driveways with tandem
spaces must have a minimum length of eighteen feet (18'), from the back side of
sidewalk, or back side of curb where no sidewalk exists.
   H.   In calculating the required parking for any given use, if the number of
required parking ends in a fraction, the number will always be rounded up to
the next whole number.
   I.   Required parking for multiple residential developments cannot be
rented, leased or otherwise utilized by another residential unit or development
with the intent of increasing the occupancy of said unit.
   J.   Dead end aisles of parking must have additional back up area such as a
hammerhead of adequate size to provide sufficient radius for back up provided
at the end of the aisle.
   K.   Parking spaces may be reduced in length by two feet (2') for vehicle
overlay where such spaces abut a planter or sidewalk area bordered by a low
curb acting as a wheel bumper, provided:
      1.   Where the parking spaces are on only one side, the planter area
shall have a minimum width of four feet (4') and a sidewalk with a minimum
width of six feet (6').
      2.   Where the parking spaces are on two (2) sides, the planter area
shall have a minimum width of six feet (6') and a sidewalk shall have a minimum
width of eight feet (8').
   L.   All structures which are required by the provisions of the
international building code to have adaptations which assist access by
handicapped persons shall, in addition, provide off street parking for
handicapped persons as described below. The provisions described below are
minimum requirements, which, for good cause, may be altered or increased by the
planning commission:
   PARKING SPACES REQUIRED
 
Total Number Of Parking  Required Number Of
Spaces In Lot Or Garage  Handicapped Spaces
   1 - 25             1
   26 - 50            2
   51 - 75            3
   76 - 100           4
   101 - 150          5
   151 - 200          6
   201 - 300          7
   301 - 400          8
   401 - 500          9
   501 - 999          2 percent of total spaces
   Over 1,000         20 spaces, plus 1 space for every 100 spaces, or
                         fraction thereof, over 1,000
 
   M.   Each lot shall be hard surfaced and be maintained in good condition and
kept clear and in an unobstructed and usable condition at all times.
Responsibility for maintenance of the lot shall rest with the property owner.
The lot shall provide adequate access to a street or alley.
   N.   Parking lots shall be graded for proper drainage with surface water
diverted in such a way as to keep the parking area free of accumulated water or
ice. Adequate control curbs shall be installed to control drainage and direct
vehicle movement. Parking lot drainage shall be controlled on site and
channeled to storm drain or gutter as approved by the city.
   O.   Maximum driveway access grades shall not exceed ten percent (10%) in
slope. For a single-family residence, the maximum grade may increase to
eighteen percent (18%) where no portion of the driveway exceeding ten percent
(10%) is used to meet the off street parking requirement and an additional off
street parking area is provided to meet the requirement. Driveways serving more
than a single-family residence shall provide a minimum twenty foot (20')
staging or transition area at no greater than a two percent (2%) slope
beginning at the back of the curb, where existing, or as otherwise approved by
the city engineer in anticipation of future street improvements.
   P.   No off street parking shall be permitted in a required front yard or
street side yard, except in a driveway meeting the minimum parking space length
requirement, or as otherwise stipulated in the respective zones.
   Q.   All public and private parking lots having ten (10) or more spaces
shall be adequately illuminated to provide for safety and protection of the
user. Any lights provided to illuminate any parking area shall be shielded so
as to reflect the light away from adjacent premises.
   R.   In the case of mixed uses in the building or on a lot, the total
requirements for off street parking facilities shall be the sum of the
requirements for the various uses computed separately. Off street parking
facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking
facilities for any other use, except as hereinafter specified for joint use.
   S.   The planning commission may, upon application by the owner or lessee of
any property, authorize the joint use of parking facilities by a conditional
use. In order to qualify for approval for joint use parking, the applicants
shall meet the conditions specified herein:
      1.   Up to fifty percent (50%) of the parking facilities required by this
chapter for a use considered to be a nighttime use may be provided by the
parking facilities of a use considered to be primarily a daytime use, provided
such reciprocal parking area shall be contiguous, and the joint use of such
facilities is assured by recording the reciprocal parking agreement in the
office of the Utah County recorder;
      2.   Identify the location and identity of each use that will share the
facility;
      3.   The projected hours of operation of each use and the hours during
which peak parking demand will be experienced;
      4.   A site plan that provides for a distance of no greater than three
hundred feet (300') from the nearest entrance of each use to the nearest edge
of the parking facility;
      5.   A site plan that demonstrates that the proposed shared parking
facility will comply with all standards required by this code for parking lot
development.
   T.   Common parking facilities may be provided in lieu of individual
requirements contained herein, provided the total of such off street parking
spaces, when used together, shall not be less than the sum of the various uses
computed separately. If the common facilities are located on more than one lot,
a covenant for the preservation of said parking facilities must be filed with
the office of the Utah County recorder.
   U.   The plans for any proposed parking area or expansion of existing
parking area shall be submitted to the community development department for
approval. The plans shall clearly indicate the proposed development, including
location, size, shape, design, curb cuts, lighting, landscaping and other
features and appurtenances of the proposed parking lot.
   V.   The following minimum landscaping requirements shall apply for all
parking areas within a proposed or amended development:
      1.   Curbed planters with two inch (2") or larger caliper shade trees,
and grass, shrubs, or ground cover shall be installed at the ends of parking
rows. The landscaped planters are to be a minimum five feet (5') wide.
      2.   Minimum two inch (2") caliper shade trees shall be planted in four
foot (4') wide curbed diamonds between double parking rows at minimum intervals
of six (6) stalls, and along single parking rows at minimum intervals of three
(3) stalls, at a distance of no more than six feet (6') from the parking area.
Shade trees are not required along the front of single parking rows which are
adjacent to buildings.
      3.   Landscaping improvement plans in parking areas must be reviewed and
approved by the parks and recreation department.
   W.   The parking requirements for land uses which are not specified in this
chapter shall be determined by the planning commission. Said determination
shall be based upon the requirements for the most comparable use specified
herein.
   X.   Adequate ingress and egress to and from all uses shall be provided as
follows:
      1.   For each residential lot: Not more than two (2) driveways per
frontage, subject to meeting the minimum street frontage requirement. Driveway
width is determined by measuring the distance along the base of the curb cut.
The following requirements shall apply to residential lots:
         a.   One driveway shall not exceed thirty two feet (32') in width,
unless the lot has a minimum frontage of one hundred feet (100'). In such
cases, the driveway may be up to forty feet (40') wide;
         b.   Two (2) driveways, not exceeding a combined total width of forty
feet (40'), may be installed on each frontage (minimum 100 feet) for a corner
lot;
         c.   All driveways on corner lots are to be located at a distance
equal to or greater than the minimum setback for the zone, measured from the
property line on each side of the corner;
         d.   A minimum separation of twenty feet (20') shall be required
between two (2) driveways for each frontage;
         e.   All driveways are to be a minimum distance of ten feet (10') from
a side property line, beginning from the measuring point of the width of the
driveway (curb cut); and
         f.   Driveway access for a residential lot, onto a designated arterial
or collector street, shall not be permitted for new subdivision proposals,
unless the city determines there are no other possible alternative accesses to
the lot. If an existing home is included within a new subdivision, it may
retain its current access onto the collector street, unless it is a corner lot
and there is reasonable opportunity to move the driveway to access the other
standard size residential street.
      2.   Access for nonresidential lots shall meet the following
requirements:
         a.   Unless otherwise restricted by the city's access management
standards, nonresidential lots shall not have more than two (2) driveways for
each one hundred feet (100') of frontage on any street.
         b.   No two (2) of said driveways shall be closer to each other than
twelve feet (12'), and no driveway shall be closer to a side property line than
three feet (3').
         c.   Each nonresidential driveway shall be not more than fifty feet
(50') wide, for multiple-lane drives, with a minimum width of sixteen feet
(16') for the receiving lane. Multiple-lane drives shall be no less than twenty
eight feet (28') wide.
The City standard for a single ingress drive (receiving lane) is to be no less
than sixteen feet (16'), and no more than thirty two feet (32') for the
combined total width of both ingress/egress lanes. These drives are to be
measured at right angles to the centerline of driveway, except as increased by
permissible curb return radii. The entire flare of any return radius shall fall
within the right-of-way.
         d.   No driveway shall be closer than fifty feet (50') to the point of
intersection of two (2) property lines at any corner as measured along the
property line.
         e.   On a street where there are no curbs or gutters, all driveways
shall be well marked and protection provided the entire length of the frontage,
exclusive of the driveways, as per approved plans.
   Y.   Each off street parking space shall be surfaced with an asphaltic or
portland cement or other binder pavement and permanently maintained so as to
provide a dustless surface. The parking area shall be so graded as to dispose
of all surface water. If such water is to be carried to adjacent streets, it
shall be piped under sidewalks.
   Z.   The sides and rear of any off street parking lot which adjoins an area
which is to remain primarily residential shall be screened from such area by a
decorative precast concrete wall or a solid visual barrier, approved by the
Community Development Director, to be not less than four feet (4') nor more
than eight feet (8') in height. (Ord. 2017-7, 1-17-2017)

Street district, and the downtown village district. Please refer to the map on
file with the city. All wall sign applications are to follow the criteria
below, unless otherwise stated in this chapter:
   A.   The Grove District: The grove district area for wall signs is identical
to the combined grove and BMP zoning districts. The requirements of this
subsection shall apply to any property with a grove or BMP zoning designation.

commercial development in these commercial zoned areas. Wall signs in the grove
and BMP zones are to adhere to the following standards:
      1.   Design: Wall signs shall have individual opaque or translucent
(nontransparent) plex faced pan channel letters or raised molded letters no
less than a half inch (0.5") thick. Logos may take the form of a flat faced
cabinet sign. Wall signs shall be harmonious with other signs and structures to
which they are attached. Wall signs may extend from the wall, but no more than
eighteen inches (18") from the surface of the wall. Wall signs shall not extend
above the roofline, parapet or eaves (see figures 13 and 14 of this section).
         a.   A sign cabinet or panel box may be used with the above criteria,
only if it is a logo or secondary verbiage to the main company name/title. The
area of the cabinet shall be counted towards the maximum allowed area of the
wall sign (see figure 15 of this section).
         b.   Residential developments may be identified with wall signs
composed of metal, concrete or masonry, not exceeding twenty (20) square feet
in area, and may be mounted on a masonry wall at the entrance to a development.
      2.   Area: Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the sign area shall
not exceed ten percent (10%) of the front building or retail space facade. The
maximum allowable area for the sides and rear of a building or retail space
facade shall be five percent (5%) of that facade (see figure 16 of this
section).
      3.   Construction: Wall signs shall be constructed of low maintenance
materials. All wiring, mounting hardware and similar components shall be
concealed.
      4.   Illumination: Wall signs may be internally or externally lit.
Exposed bulbs or neon may only be permitted through the design review board if
consistent with the design theme for the area.
   B.   State Street District: This district is represented by the C-G, C-S,
CS-2, and P-O zones boundaries, unless otherwise stated in this chapter. The
State Street district has been created mainly in part to the significant amount
of existing commercial business in this district that already use flat faced
cabinet signage. The regulations of this section shall also be applied to
residential zoned properties that are home to a church, school, institutional
or recreational facilities only.
      1.   Design: Individual channel or raised/molded letter signs are
preferred; however, a flat faced cabinet sign may be allowed in this district.
All wall signs shall be harmonious with other signs and structures to which
they are attached. Wall signs may extend from the wall, but no more than
eighteen inches (18") from the surface of the wall. All signs shall not extend
above the roofline, parapet or eaves (see figures 17 and 18 of this section).
      2.   Area: Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the sign area shall
not exceed ten percent (10%) of the front building or retail space facade. The
maximum allowable area for the sides and rear of a building or retail space
facade shall be five percent (5%) of that facade (see figure 16 of this
section).
         a.   In the C-N zone, wall sign areas shall not exceed five percent
(5%) of the total facade of the retail space or building facade which faces a
property that is residential in use.
      3.   Construction: Wall signs shall be constructed of low maintenance
materials. All wiring, mounting hardware and similar components shall be

   C.   Downtown Village District: This district area is identical to the
downtown village zone boundaries, which includes all subdistricts. The
objective of this district is to match the goals and objectives of the zone and
the downtown 2020 action plan. The intent is to preserve the old downtown
character while creating new growth, business, and living opportunities in the
downtown area, and maintain a consistent image. The city shall require that all
signage follows these objectives:
      1.   Wall signs during this period is a lost art, so the city requires
the use of suspended/projecting, or awning signage as a first priority for
businesses seeking facade advertisement. For these preferred signage options,
refer to the subsequent section (section
10-19-12 of this chapter) for the specific criteria needed to comply.
      2.   A molded sign with raised lettering may be used as a secondary sign
once a suspended/projecting or awning sign is installed. If a molded wall sign
is to be installed the following regulations are to be met:
         a.   Design: For the molded signs, these signs are to have raised
lettering, a minimum one-fourth inch (1/4") thick, and the sign structure may
extend from the wall, but no more than eighteen inches (18") from the surface.
All signs shall not extend above the roofline, parapet or eaves.
         b.   Area: Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the sign area
shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the front building or retail space
facade. The maximum allowable area for the sides and rear of a building or
retail space facade shall be five percent (5%) of that facade (see figure 16 of
this section).
         c.   Construction: Wall signs shall be constructed of low maintenance
materials. All wiring, mounting hardware and similar components shall be
concealed.
         d.   Illumination: Unless otherwise stated in this section, these wall
signs are to have external lighting in the form of gooseneck lighting fixtures,
or other appropriate lighting fixtures that meet the design restrictions for
the downtown area. Any lighting must be shielded to prevent glare. Exposed
bulbs or neon shall not be permitted unless otherwise stated in this chapter.

The design of developments and subdivisions shall preserve, insofar as it is
possible, the natural terrain, natural drainage, existing topsoil, trees and
vegetation. Land which is subject to hazardous conditions such as landslides,
mudflows, rockfalls, snow avalanches, ground subsidence, shallow water table,
open quarries, floods, wetlands, and polluted water supply shall not be
subdivided until the hazards have been eliminated or evidence submitted that
the said hazards will be eliminated or mitigated by the development and
construction plans. All cut/fill slopes and other areas as determined by the
city engineer shall be reseeded or planted with vegetation. All developments as
required by section
11-3-5 of this title shall submit a traffic study. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-2-2: POLICY OF TITLE INSURANCE:
It is necessary to demonstrate a recent current policy of title insurance or a
preliminary title report showing that the persons listed as the owners in the
owner's dedication certificate on a plat or development have sufficient control
over the premises to effectually dedicate streets within the development where
required and to follow through with all other requirements of the city
ordinances. The parcel identification number assigned by the Utah County
recorder's office will be required with each application submitted for review
and approval. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-2-3: PHASING:
If the project is to be done in phases, the phasing must be completed in a
logical sequence, and in an orderly manner, without leapfrogging. A phasing
plan shall be provided by the developer for all projects done in phases. This
plan must be approved by the planning commission. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-2-4: DEVELOPABLE LAND:
Developable land is land under thirty percent (30%) slope which is capable of
being improved, subject to the sensitive lands ordinance (chapter 8 of this
title), with landscaping, buildings or parking. Land devoted to wetlands
preservation shall not be considered developable land, and must be subtracted
out of the total acreage before the density calculation is made, unless all or
a portion of the wetlands have been approved by the city council as usable
wetlands. When wetlands are not to be included as part of a lot, the wetland
will be required to be included on the plat as designated open space.
Exceptions: For those lots within the R-R or A-1 zone, wetlands may be included
as part of the lot, provided there is sufficient buildable area to accommodate
the proposed use. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. 2003 Code; Ord. 2004-19, 8-17-

structure placement must comply with the setbacks of the zone where property is
located. The buildable area will be required to be placed on any proposed
subdivision plat or development plans for the purpose of notifying future
owners of the approved buildable area as per setbacks and easements. (Ord.
2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-2-6: SAVING EXISTING VEGETATION:
Developments shall be designed to incorporate existing large trees, clusters of
trees or clusters of larger shrubs. The planning commission, or a designated
subcommittee, shall review the appropriateness of removal of portions of these
types of vegetation if proposed in the development plan. The planning
commission may approve removal of some or all vegetation based on a
determination of the following criteria: benefits of the existing plant
material; the efforts made to save and incorporate the existing plant material
into the design of the project versus the problems the plant materials may
create for the project in terms of general construction techniques; impact the
removal will have on the character of the area; the topography of the site; or
harmful conditions the vegetation may create. Because one of the purposes of
development is to protect natural features, the planning commission may deny
approval of a development if it is determined there has been removal of trees
or shrubs prior to submittal. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)

to one and eight-tenths (1.8) shares per acre of landscaped area contained in
the development.
            (2)   Exterior water features: This includes swimming pools,
jacuzzis, ponds, fountains, or similar water using amenities. Dedicate water in
the amount equal to the average annual water use for the proposed facility as
determined by the City Engineer.
            (3)   Utility and/or joint use area interior water uses: This
includes the internal water used in clubhouses, service buildings, or similar
structures for use in showers, saunas, jacuzzis, sinks, toilets, etc. Dedicate
water in the amount determined by the City Engineer.
            (4)   Private interior water uses: This includes the water used in
all interior unit spaces. Dedicate water in the amount determined by the city
engineer.
         b.   Water Required Shall Be Dedicated:
            (1)   Multi-family residential: Water required shall be dedicated
prior to the recordation of the development plat or at the time of building
permit issuance when building on an empty parcel.
            (2)   Commercial use:
               (A)   For exterior water uses and landscaping: Water required
shall be dedicated prior to beginning work on the approved site plan and to
issuance of the building permit for the building shell.
               (B)   For interior water uses: Water required shall be dedicated
prior to the issuance of the building permit for the tenant improvements (TI).
Water requirements are based on the first tenant use and are not increased or
decreased with subsequent remodeling of interior space via another TI building
permit.
         c.   Water Use By Existing Facilities: A credit for the water use by
existing facilities with a historic metered water use is given at the time of
water requirement calculation. Additional water is not required for remodeling
of existing facilities where square footage or number of overall units is not
changing.
      3.   Upon dedication of the water stock, the applicant shall have no
further interest of any kind or nature in said water stock.
      4.   Water dedicated will be held in trust by the city for future
culinary and/or secondary use. The city may use the water for culinary and/or
secondary purposes in any area of the city in which it deems appropriate, so
long as culinary and/or secondary water from other sources is made available to
the developed land.
   B.   Relief Petition: Any applicant for development within Pleasant Grove
City, may file a relief petition with the city recorder seeking relief from all
or part of the water right dedication requirements as contained in this section
on the basis that the requirement, as applied to the applicant or to the
specific property for which the subdivision or building permit is being
requested are inequitable, or should be modified for any just cause. The
applicant may petition the city for relief from the requirements pursuant to
the following provisions:
      1.   Relief From "Type" Of Water Required: The applicant must demonstrate
the inability to obtain the required water shares requested to the satisfaction
of the city. If a relief petition is granted, the applicant shall be allowed to
meet the water right dedication requirements in one of the following methods as
recommended by city staff in the formal decision:
         a.   The applicant may transfer other surface irrigation shares or
water rights that can be readily used in the city's secondary water system. All
proposed water rights transfers shall be reviewed by the city engineer and may
or may not be acceptable to the city for water rights dedication. When
permitted, the amount of stock in other irrigation companies must be equivalent
to shares of Pleasant Grove Irrigation Company stock. Only shares in approved
irrigation companies will be accepted.
         b.   The applicant may be allowed to pay the city in cash the
equivalent cost of the required water rights. This money will be used by the
city to recoup the cost of previously purchased water rights or purchase new
water rights. The cost assessed is determined by the city engineer based on
recent market prices for local surface irrigation and water rights.
         c.   The applicant may transfer local water rights to the city that
have been historically used on the specific ground that is being developed. All
water rights transfers including change applications, assignment, use
retirement, etc., are the responsibility of the applicant. All proposed water
rights transfers shall be reviewed by the city engineer and may or may not be
acceptable to the city for water rights dedication. For residential
developments, the transfer must be completed prior to the recording of the
final plat. For other than residential developments, the transfer must be
completed prior to the issuance of a building permit.
         d.   The applicant may be allowed to transfer another type of water if
it is determined by the city engineer to be in the best interest of the city.
      2.   Relief From "Amount" Of Water Required: The applicant must
demonstrate the inequity of the requirement to the satisfaction of the city. If
a relief petition is granted, the applicant shall be given a revised water
right dedication requirement as recommended by city staff in the formal
decision.
      3.   Relief From Any Other Water Requirement: The relief petition process
may not be used for reasons other than the type or amount of water required.
   C.   Relief Petition Process:
      1.   Time For Filing Notice Of Petition And Petition: No later than ten
(10) calendar days from formal action by the city on any subdivision or
building permit application wherein a requirement for water rights dedication
is specified, the applicant shall file a notice of petition in writing with the
city recorder. Within thirty (30) days of filing a notice of petition, the
applicant shall file a relief petition with the city recorder.

11-2-13: AMENDMENTS MAY BE REQUIRED:
   A.   Findings: Before approving a preliminary plan or a final plat of a
subdivision, the planning commission may require amendments or modifications to
the plan if it finds that:
      1.   The layout of the development or subdivision does not conform to
acceptable standards of design as set forth in this title.
      2.   The development or subdivision is not provided with adequate ingress
or egress.
      3.   The development or subdivision contains geologic, soil, water or
other hazards which would be detrimental to the subdivision, surrounding area
or to the city.
      4.   The development or subdivision does not provide the required
improvements or quality of improvements, or does not comply with other
requirements as set forth in this title.
      5.   The dimensions of the development or subdivision, or any lot, do not
mathematically close.
   B.   Scope Of Amendments Or Modifications: Such amendments or modifications
shall be sufficient in all cases to correct the inadequacies so that the
development or subdivision will conform to the requirements of this title.
(Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-2-14: COMPLIANCE WITH FINAL PLAT:
Every approved development or subdivision shall be constructed, developed, or
otherwise completed according to the provisions of this title, in conformance
to the approved final development plans or plat and supplementary documents. It
is the responsibility of the developer or subdivider to ensure that such
provisions are correctly constructed, installed or otherwise completed. Failure
to comply with this provision shall constitute grounds for immediate
termination of all work activity associated with such development or
subdivision. Before the resumption of work activity, the developer or
subdivider shall accomplish one of the following:
   A.   Agree, in writing, to reconstruct, at his cost, those items not in

CHAPTER 3
STREET STANDARDS AND IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED
SECTION:
11-3-1: Purpose Of Chapter
11-3-2: Bonding For Improvements Required As A Condition For Plat Recordation
11-3-3: Exceptions
11-3-4: Street Standards
11-3-5: Block Standards
11-3-6: Lot Standards
11-3-7: Cuts In Pavement
11-3-8: Parkways
11-3-1: PURPOSE OF CHAPTER:
It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to require the same standard of
streets adjacent to single lots and those outside of subdivisions as are
required for lots and parcels developed within subdivisions, including, but not
limited to, water and sewer mains, curb, gutter, sidewalk, and street hard
surfacing. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-3-2: BONDING FOR IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION FOR PLAT RECORDATION:
It is hereby declared unlawful for the developer of any parcel of ground within
the City for residential, industrial or commercial purposes to build on the
parcel without constructing the adjacent streets that provide public access to
the developed property. Bonding for the development of the streets and
installation of culinary and secondary water and sewer mains, curb, gutter,
sidewalk, and street paving for the full lot frontage throughout the entire
development, shall be considered a necessary condition precedent to recordation
of the final plat. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-3-3: EXCEPTIONS:
To the extent that real property is developed in areas where other streets are
not fully improved (e.g., the building of a farmhouse in an agricultural area
where there are no other properties developed with curb, gutter and sidewalk),
a building permit may be issued upon receipt from the developer of the property
of a guarantee bond to install the improvements at a later date consistent with
street development of adjacent properties. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-3-4: STREET STANDARDS:
The type and arrangement of roadways peripheral to and abutting any development
shall be in compliance with the City major street plan. Projects that are
located on or next to a collector or arterial street shall be designed and
developed so the public street continues through the project in a logical, safe
manner. Projects that are located at the end of stubbed local public streets
may be required to extend the street through the development based on the
proposed circulation needs of the area, as determined by the Planning
Commission. During the preliminary approval, the Planning Commission, upon
recommendation of the planning and engineering staff, shall determine if the
street should be extended as a through street or as a cul-de-sac.
   A.   Street Widths: Street widths shall conform with the City major street
plan as adopted.
      1.   Minor street dedications shall have a minimum width of fifty six
feet (56') with a pavement width of forty feet (40').
      2.   All City streets designated in the general plan as "boulevard"
streets require a five foot (5') planting strip (to accommodate trees and grass
between the curb and sidewalk).
   B.   Cul-De-Sacs: Each cul-de-sac shall have a minimum dedicated diameter of
one hundred twelve feet (112').
      1.   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall not exceed four hundred
feet (400'), except that a maximum of six hundred fifty feet (650') may be
approved through conditional use permit by the Planning Commission, with
positive recommendation by the City Fire Marshal. In such case, conditions
regarding the looping or installation of additional water lines may be
required. Turnaround areas shall be one hundred feet (100') in diameter.
      2.   Cul-de-sacs shall be used only where unusual drainage or land
ownership configurations exist which make other designs undesirable or
impossible; and where street plans for the area do not require through
circulation.
   C.   Alleys: Where accepted by the Planning Commission, alleys shall be a
minimum of twenty feet (20') in width and shall be fully paved.
   D.   Easements: Where alleys are not provided, easements of not less than
ten feet (10') on all sides of lots shall be provided.
   E.   Street Intersections: Streets will intersect each other as nearly as
possible at right angles. All streets shall intersect at an angle of not less
than eighty degrees (80°). Offsets in street alignment between ten feet (10')
and one hundred fifty feet (150') shall be prohibited.
   F.   Street Grades: Minimum street grades shall be four-tenths of one
percent (0.4%) and maximum street grades shall be ten percent (10%), except
that the Planning Commission shall have the power to require a steeper or
lesser grade when, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the best development of
the land is thereby secured.
   G.   Street Curves: Where the street lines within a block deflect from each
other at any point more than three degrees (3°), there shall be a connecting
curve. The radius of the curve for the inner street line shall be not less than
three hundred fifty feet (350') for all arterial streets, two hundred fifty
feet (250') for collector streets, and one hundred feet (100') for minor
streets. Local streets shall be designed with curves where possible.
   H.   Corner Returns: Curbs at all intersections shall be rounded with curves
having a minimum radius as indicated in the standard specifications and
drawings. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a curve.
In the event that a traffic signal is planned, the property line shall be
created by drawing a line between the PC and PT of the corner return.
   I.   Design Specifications: Specifications for the design of street subbase,
base, hard surfacing, curb and gutters, sidewalks, and the treatment of
drainage courses shall comply with standard specifications as adopted by the
City and administered by the City Engineer.
   J.   Street Names: New streets names shall not duplicate those already
existing. A street, obviously a continuation of another already in existence,
shall bear the same name. The numerical system of street designations shall be
maintained and extended where possible.
   K.   Street Dedications And Paving: All streets shall be dedicated for
public use. The full width (described above) of all streets within a
subdivision shall be dedicated and the roadway paved. No partial streets will
be permitted except:
      1.   When a new street is on the border of a subdivision, the side of the
street on the outside of the subdivision does not require dedication or
improvements behind the curb and gutter provided the edge of the right-of-way
dedicated is the subdivision boundary and no nuisance strip is created between
the dedication and other private property.
      2.   In cases where the right-of-way needed for the full pavement width
(back of curb to back of curb) of a street cannot be obtained after a
reasonable, good faith effort on the part of an applicant, where the use of
eminent domain by the City is the only remaining option, the City Council may
approve a narrower roadway pavement. The applicant:
         a.   Shall provide evidence of the effort to obtain the right-of- way.
         b.   Shall provide the maximum width possible, however in no case
shall the narrower roadway provide a pavement of less than thirty feet (30')
for residential streets and thirty five feet (35') for collectors or greater.
         c.   Shall meet any additional requirements of the City Engineer and
Public Works Director with regard to the pavement, parking, or other issues on
any partial street.
         d.   May not propose any lots which obtain required frontage on any
partial street.
         e.   May not use a partial street as a required access to the required
frontage of any lot.
City staff will present the request for the partial street as part of the plat
review/approval process before the Planning Commission and City Council. Public
comment will be taken on the request at the public hearing for the plat. The
Planning Commission will make a recommendation to the City Council on the
request.
      3.   When right-of-way needed to connect a proposed subdivision to an
existing street cannot be obtained after a reasonable, good faith effort on the
part of an applicant, where the use of eminent domain by the City is the only
remaining option, the City Council may approve a temporary access to the
subdivision. The following shall apply:
         a.   The temporary access shall be abandoned as a public access when a
public street access meeting City standards becomes available to connect the
subdivision to existing streets.
         b.   The applicant shall provide evidence of the effort to obtain the
standard access right-of-way.
         c.   The subdivision property shall be included in the officially
adopted local streets vicinity plan.
         d.   No lot may obtain frontage on any temporary access.
         e.   The subdivision shall include an area of right-of-way dedication
to meet street standards at the time of development approval.
         f.   Excluding street width and standard street improvements (i.e.,
curb and gutter, park strip, and sidewalk), the temporary access shall be paved
to meet City standards for a public street.
         g.   All temporary accesses shall comply with the following standards:
            (1)   Minimum width: Twenty five feet (25').
            (2)   Minimum length: The minimum lot width for the zone.
            (3)   Maximum length: Three hundred feet (300').
            (4)   Minimum curve radius: One hundred feet (100').
            (5)   Maximum lots served by a temporary access: Three (3) unless
approved by Council with positive recommendations from engineer and Fire
Marshal after review of safety and traffic issues.
            (6)   Minimum frontage on a public street: Twenty five feet (25').
            (7)   Minimum pavement width: Twenty feet (20').
            (8)   Surfacing standard: With the exception of an optional
concrete driveway entrance where the access connects to the isolated standard
street within the development, the entire access shall be surfaced with either
asphalt or concrete adequate to support the weight of a fire apparatus (H-20
standard).
   L.   Relations To Adjoining Streets: The arrangement of streets in new
developments shall make provision for the continuation of the existing streets
in the adjoining area (or their proper protection where adjoining land is not
subdivided) at the same or greater width (but in no case less than the required
minimum width) unless variations are deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission. Where the Planning Commission determines that it is desirable to
provide for street access to adjoining property in order to provide orderly
development of a street system, proposed streets shall be extended by
dedication to the boundary of such property.
   M.   Sidewalks: Sidewalks shall be five feet (5') in width except where
other widths are deemed appropriate by the City Engineer, and comply with the
latest Americans With Disabilities Act requirements.
   N.   Improvements: All improvements within a public right-of-way must
conform to the standard drawings and specifications set by the City Engineer.
   O.   Stub Streets: If a stub street exceeds one hundred feet (100') in
length, it must be terminated in a temporary turnaround having a minimum
diameter of ninety six feet (96') or an approved hammerhead or tee
configuration as approved by the City Engineer. The turnaround area must have a
paved surface with either asphalt or concrete adequate to support the weight of
a fire apparatus (H-20 standard) (see section
10-15-42 of this Code).
   P.   Seal Coat: A crack seal and seal coat is required to be applied on all
new asphalt pavement and patches approximately one year after the end of the
final inspection of the project. The City has implemented a fee to provide for
this requirement. Payment of the fee is required prior to holding a
preconstruction meeting or within two (2) weeks of receiving notice of the
payment amount from the City Engineer. Details regarding the fee and the policy
governing this requirement can be found in the Standard Specifications adopted
by the City. (Ord. 2018-15, 6-12-2018)
11-3-5: BLOCK STANDARDS:
   A.   Length: The maximum length of blocks shall be one thousand three
hundred feet (1,300') and the minimum length of blocks shall be four hundred
feet (400'). In blocks over eight hundred feet (800') in length, the subdivider
shall dedicate a passageway or alley through the block at approximately the
center of the block. Such passageway or alley shall not be less than ten feet
(10') in width.
   B.   Width: The width of blocks shall be sufficient to allow two (2) tiers
of lots.
   C.   Second Access: A second access shall be required if a street with a
single means of ingress and egress, and having a turnaround, exceeds a maximum
average daily trip (ADT) level of two hundred fifty (250). ADT studies shall be
approved by the City Engineer.
   D.   Traffic Study: A traffic study shall be required when determined by the
Plan Coordinating Committee. Those items to be considered in the study shall
include: pedestrians, bicycles, motor vehicles, street design and other items
as determined by the committee. The traffic study shall be completed by the
applicant and submitted at the time of application. Modifications to the
traffic study will be required if the proposed project changes during the
review process or all the required information is not included in the first
submittal. A traffic study shall be signed and stamped by a licensed
professional engineer and approved by the City Engineer. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-
2000)
11-3-6: LOT STANDARDS:
   A.   Building Sites: The lot arrangement, design and shape shall be such
that lots will provide a compact body of land for buildings and be properly
related to topography and conform to requirements set forth herein. Lots shall
not contain peculiarly shaped elongations solely to provide necessary square
footage which would be unusable for normal purposes. The building pad must meet
zoning setback requirements for each lot and the buildable area must be shown
with appropriate setbacks for the zone in which it is located.
   B.   Lot Sizes: All lots shown on the subdivision plat must conform to the
minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance for the zone in which the
subdivision is located.
   C.   Lots Must Abut On Public Streets: Each lot shall abut on a street
dedicated by the subdivision plat or an existing publicly dedicated street,
except when approved by the Planning Commission. Interior lots having frontage
on two (2) streets shall be prohibited, except where topographic conditions
make such design desirable, and approval by the Planning Commission is gained.
(Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. Ord. 2000-48, 11-21-2000)
   D.   Corner Lots: Corner lots shall have dimensions sufficient for the
maintenance of required building setback lines on both streets, along with
sufficient area to comply with area requirements of the zoning ordinance.
Corner lot widths shall be measured in accordance with the definition of "lot,
corner" at section
10-6-2 of this Code, regardless of how a structure is situated on the lot.
(Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. Ord. 2000-48, 11-21-2000; 2003 Code)
   E.   Parts Of Lots: All remnants of lots below minimum size, left over after
subdividing a larger tract, must be attached to adjacent lots, and evidence of
such attachment submitted prior to the approval of the final plat. All lots
designated within a subdivision must meet the minimum standards of the zone
within which they are located.
   F.   Divided Lots: Where the lots covered by a subdivision include two (2)
or more parcels in separate ownership, all parcels shall be transferred by deed
to single ownership before approval of the final plat, and such transfer
recorded in the county recorder's office. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. Ord.
2000-48, 11-21-2000)
11-3-7: CUTS IN PAVEMENT:
No cuts shall be made in street pavement for at least five (5) years after hard
surfacing has been installed unless approved by the city council. (Ord. 2000-
23, 7-18-2000)
11-3-8: PARKWAYS:
The intent of this section is to maintain the appearance of parkways, protect
the users of parkways and improve environmental conditions. A parkway is the
strip of real property next to a road which is between the curb and sidewalk
(a.k.a. park strip or planter strip).
   A.   Where Required:
      1.   Parkways are required on all collector and larger class streets, as
designated in the general plan.
      2.   Residential streets in certain areas of the city designated for a
"rural" appearance also require parkways.

without first having obtained a grading permit from the city engineer based on
the provisions of this subsection.
      2.   Land having an average slope of greater than twenty five percent
(25%) shall be deemed to be land having a "steep slope" within the meaning of
subsection 11-8-11B of this chapter. Any person proposing to grade, excavate,
fill or to erect any structure on such land shall submit a geotechnical report
as though the same were required by the city engineer pursuant to subsection
11-8-6B of this chapter. This subsection shall not apply if a geotechnical
report (as required by this chapter) relating to the subject property has, at
an earlier date, been acknowledged by the city engineer.

obtained from a cut permitted under an approved grading plan, or imported from
outside the hillside area of the city.
      7.   Cut slopes shall be constructed to eliminate sharp angles of
intersection with the existing terrain and shall be rounded and contoured as
necessary to blend with existing topography to the maximum extent possible. The
city will not accept the dedication and maintenance of cut and fill slopes
except those within the required street right of way. Where a cut or fill slope
occurs between two (2) lots, the slope shall normally be made part of the
downhill lot. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
      8.   The international building code shall be complied with, except that
decisions described therein to be made by the "building official" may also be
made by the city engineer. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. 2003 Code)
   B.   Drainage:
      1.   Required storm water runoff collection facilities shall be designed
so as to retain storm water runoff on development sites for a sufficient length
of time so as to prevent flooding and erosion during storm water runoff flow
periods.
      2.   Required storm water runoff collection facilities shall be so
designed as to divert surface water away from cut faces or sloping surfaces of
a fill. French drains are not acceptable.
      3.   Curb, gutter and pavement designs shall be such that water on
roadways is prevented from flowing off the roadways.
      4.   Natural drainage shall be riprapped, or otherwise stabilized to the
satisfaction of the city engineer, below drainage and culvert discharge points
for a distance sufficient to convey the discharge without channel erosion.
      5.   Material from construction, including soil and other solid
materials, shall not be deposited within a natural or manmade drainage course
nor within irrigation channels.
      6.   Sediment catchment ponds shall be constructed downstream from each
development, unless sediment retention facilities are otherwise provided.
   C.   Vegetation And Revegetation:
      1.   Every effort shall be made to conserve topsoil, which is removed
during construction, for later use on areas requiring vegetation or
landscaping, e.g., cut and fill slopes.
      2.   Areas not contained within lot boundaries shall be protected with
adapted, fire-resistant species of perennial vegetal cover after all
construction is completed. A list of acceptable species is available from the
community development director.
      3.   New plantings shall be protected with organic cover.
      4.   All disturbed soil surfaces shall be stabilized before final
acceptance of the subdivision by the city.
      5.   In all areas under the ownership and control of the subdivider, he
shall be fully responsible for any destruction of native vegetation which is
required to be retained, he shall carry the responsibility for such areas both
for his own employees and for all subcontractors from the first day of
construction until final acceptance of the subdivision by the city. The
subdivider shall be responsible for replacing such destroyed vegetation.
      6.   At the termination of the bonding period, any dead plant materials
required and installed by the subdivider shall be replaced, and a new bond
issued to assure establishment of the replaced materials.
   D.   Fire Protection:
      1.   Lot size and potential placement of buildings thereon shall be such
that adequate clearance from hazardous, flammable vegetative cover may be
accomplished.
      2.   All easements for firebreaks for safety of built up areas shall
encompass access for firefighting personnel and equipment. Such easements shall
be dedicated for this specific purpose by being recorded.
      3.   The inability to provide fire line water pressure consistent with
the standards set by the insurance service organization shall be justification
for denial of a subdivision request.
   E.   Streets:
      1.   Hillside streets should reflect a rural rather than urban character.
Street alignments, where possible, should be parallel to contours, in valleys,
or on ridges. If a location between a valley and a ridge is unavoidable,
directional pavements shall be split, with the principal of grading being half
cut and half fill versus all fill or all cut. Split streets may be provided by
the subdivider according to the following schedule:
         a.   One lane in each direction; the split section width of the
pavement shall be sixteen feet (16').
         b.   Two (2) lanes in each direction; the split section width of the
pavement shall be twenty two feet (22'). The median between split streets shall
not exceed the slope of two feet (2') horizontal for each one foot (1')
vertical and such median shall be planted by the subdivider and maintained for
one year, to the satisfaction of the city engineer. Where deemed appropriate by
the city engineer, lots may be located between the split pavements and such
lots may front on both lanes.
      2.   Collective driveways shall only be permitted where such utilization
will result in better building access than would be possible if a public street
were required. Said collective driveways shall not be used as required street
frontage for the lots which they serve. Collective driveways permitted to serve
a maximum of six (6) dwellings, shall be paved to a width not less than twelve
feet (12') and shall not exceed one hundred fifty feet (150') in length.
Collective driveways serving more than six (6) dwellings shall be paved to a
width of not less than twenty feet (20') and shall not exceed three hundred
fifty feet (350') in length. Turnarounds must be provided at the end of
collective driveways. Signs indicating the driveways as private shall be
erected in compliance with city standards. Collective driveways shall not be
maintained in any way by the city.
      3.   Cul-de-sacs may serve no more than ten (10) dwelling units and shall
be a maximum of four hundred feet (400') long. A suitable turnaround shall be
provided at the end of stub streets.
      4.   Streets in hillside areas may intersect at the minimum angle of
sixty degrees (60°), provided they meet all other legal requirements relating
to the construction of streets.
      5.   The following minimum dimensions are to be utilized in the design of
hillside streets:
         a.   All streets shall have suitable pavement edging, such as curbs
and gutters. Concrete gutters must be provided where street drainage is
accommodated.
         b.   The width of the graded section shall extend three feet (3')
beyond the curb face or edge of sidewalk on the fill side and two feet (2') on
the cut side of the street.
         c.   Sidewalks of not less than four feet (4') in width may be
required on one side of minor streets and on both sides of a collector street,
except that where adjacent to a curb, all sidewalks shall be five feet (5') in
width.
         d.   Parking lanes, eight feet (8') in width, may be required on at
least one side of all public streets except where existing topography renders
development adjacent to the street impractical, or where the street serves
solely as an access road, or where an adequate number of off street parking
spaces are provided on each lot adjacent to the street. Streets without parking
lanes shall be provided with emergency parking stalls adequate to contain at
least two (2) vehicles per lot.
         e.   The following travel lane widths shall be required all hillside
areas:
            (1)   The side of a travel lane not adjacent to another travel lane
shall be increased by two feet (2').
            (2)   Minor hillside streets shall have a minimum travel lane of
ten feet (10').
            (3)   Collector hillside streets shall have a minimum travel lane
of twelve feet (12').
   F.   Preservation Of Hillside Vistas: Development proposed at five thousand
feet (5,000') ASL or above will be discouraged and will require compelling
justification for approval by the planning commission. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-
2000)
11-8-15: SHALLOW GROUND WATER AREA DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
Development in shallow ground water areas shall be subject to the following
standards:
   A.   Wetlands will not be permitted to be included as part of any buildable
subdivision or development lot. Exception: For developments within the R-R or

easements) running with the land, has been granted by the irrigation company
specifying the following:
      1.   The city will be held harmless from all damage or injury resulting
from flooding, water pollution, or high ground water from drainage in the ditch
or canal.
      2.   The irrigation ditch or canal can be placed in a pipe or culvert at
a time deemed necessary by the owner of the easement, except for the channels
provided for in the master storm water management plan, wherein the channels
are to remain in an open, nonpiped condition (section
8-6-5 of this code).
      3.   The owner of property which is the subject of a development plan
will provide, and record with the county recorder, a statement holding the city
harmless from all damage within the project resulting from flooding or shallow
ground water.
      4.   A disclosure statement be placed upon all subdivision plats in the

GUTTERS:
The purpose of this section is to avoid liability to the city and to the owners
of private property because of defective sidewalks.
   A.   Authority: The city may, on its own initiative or at the request of
others, construct, reconstruct, repair, or replace sidewalks, curbs and
gutters, located on public property. To provide a comprehensive approach for
such construction, repair or replacement, the city administration may adopt a
policy statement setting forth standards for annual inspection, planning,
construction, repair and replacement. The policy manual may also establish
criteria for setting priorities for repair or replacement, based upon hazard to
the public; and may further provide for phased implementation based upon the
seriousness of existing and potential hazards and the availability of funds.
   B.   Considerations: It shall be the sole prerogative of the city to decide
the necessity and the extent of the construction, extraordinary repairs or
replacements to be preformed by the city or its agent. Conditions to be
considered by the city when determining whether sidewalks, curbs and gutters
should be constructed, repaired or replaced pursuant to this section shall
include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Broken sidewalk panels; or
      2.   Panels having a different elevation at the junction thereof; or
      3.   Sidewalk panels with a deteriorated surface; or
      4.   Sidewalks not conforming with the requirements of the Americans with
disabilities act (ADA); or
      5.   A finding that the condition of the sidewalk is hazardous for
anticipated users thereof; and
      6.   A finding that inclusion of the proposed repairs in a special
improvement district is not practical.
   C.   Request By Owner; Agreement: When the owner of real property requests
repair or replacement of sidewalk, curb or gutter abutting upon or adjacent to
the owner's land, at a time which is different than that scheduled by the city,
the city, at its option, may decline to make such out of pocket improvements
pursuant to one of the following alternative agreements, which alternative
agreement shall be chosen by mutual agreement with the owner of real property:
      1.   Have the city provide or contract for all labor and materials
required for removal, replacement or repair, with the city assuming fifty
percent (50%) of the cost and the owner assuming fifty percent (50%) of the
cost; or
      2.   Negotiate an equitable sharing of the cost of removal and
replacement based on the special or unique characteristics of the particular
sidewalk, curb and gutter right of way and the benefits to such property by
reason of the removal, replacement or repair.
   D.   Owner Caused Damage: If the owner of the real property has directly or
indirectly been the cause of damage to the subject sidewalk, curb or gutter,
the repair or replacement shall be considered a benefit to that owner and the
owner shall assume all costs attributed to the owner's actions or neglect.
   E.   Determination Of City Engineer: The city engineer, or his designee,
shall, within fifteen (15) days of any request, determine as described in this
subsection if sidewalk, curb or gutter shall be repaired, removed or replaced,
and shall make the allocation described in subsection C of this section between
the landowner and the city of the reasonable costs of repair, removal or
replacement. In the absence of the city engineer's setting forth unique
circumstances, as described in subsection C of this section, it shall be
presumed that proper allocation of costs is payment of fifty percent (50%) by
the property owner and payment of fifty percent (50%) by the city.
   F.   Owner's Obligation Of Payment; Notice Requirement: The owner's
obligation of payment described in subsection C of this section shall not
commence until thirty (30) days after the city has mailed reasonable notice
(unless the same has been waived in writing) to each owner of real property
described in subsection C of this section, which notice shall contain not less
than the following:
      1.   A description of the sidewalk, curb or gutter which has been or is
proposed to be repaired or replaced, and the reason therefor;
      2.   The cost of the repair and the allocation of that cost between the
property owner and the city; and
      3.   A statement that the property owner may appeal any claim by the city
for payment and a description of the time and manner in which the same may be
done.
   G.   Appeal: Any person directly affected by a decision of the city
engineer, or his designee, may appeal the same to the city council within
thirty (30) days.
   H.   Reasonable Terms: The city may agree to reasonable terms, including the
payment of interest, for the payment of the share of costs to be paid by the
property owner. The city may bring a civil action and collect any unpaid sum,
including interest, costs and reasonable attorney fees, which is owed pursuant
to this section.
   I.   Exception Of Applicability: This section shall not apply to the new
construction of sidewalks in subdivisions or other places. This section shall
not prohibit the repair of sidewalks for reasons other than those described,
applicable law, and city specifications. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)

   A.   Required Prepayment Of Inspection Costs: All inspection, testing, GPS
services, and mapping, as provided and detailed within this title and the
Pleasant Grove City standard specifications and drawings, shall be paid for by
the developer. The developer shall prepay for such costs in the form of a cash
payment to Pleasant Grove City either at the pre-construction meeting or not
later than two (2) weeks from developer's receipt of calculations from the
City. If payment has not been made within the required time period, City may
issue a stop work order on the project until the fees have been paid. Prepaid
fees will be placed into an escrow account and drawn upon as costs are
incurred. If costs for these services exceed the amount in the escrow account,
they will be the responsibility of the developer and paid for prior to
receiving final acceptance at the end of the developments warranty period and
prior to release of the warranty bonding. If the developer does not pay
additional amounts, the warranty bond may be used to pay for any additional
amounts required.
   B.   Determining Pre-Payment Amount: The prepaid amount shall be two percent

for all construction bonds under one hundred sixty seven thousand dollars
($167,000.00) and a minimum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for any site
plan without a construction bond requirement. The City Engineer or his designee
may determine a pre-payment amount less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00)
in circumstances where five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) would be unreasonable,
such as in cases where building permits include a single lot development. Pre-
payment of fees shall not indemnify the developer from paying for costs, which
the City may incur, above the prepaid amount.
   C.   Tracking: The City shall establish a file for each subdivision plat to
monitor and track the inspection, testing, GPS services, or mapping progress of
the subdivision. Inspections shall be scheduled by the developer through the
Public Works Department and may be performed by City personnel or consultants
as determined necessary by the City. Services conducted by a consultant will be
tracked by the amount billed to each project and the entire amount of the bill
for those services will be reimbursed to the City using the prepaid fees.
   D.   Reimbursement: At the conclusion of a final walk through and City
acceptance of the improvements, the developer may be reimbursed any amount
remaining in the escrow account. Before final acceptance, the developer shall
submit a formal written request to determine the reimbursement amount or
additional costs, if necessary. Any reimbursement shall be given in accordance
with section

CHAPTER 16
PERFORMANCE BONDS FOR LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT
SECTION:
11-16-1: Performance Bonds
11-16-1: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
This section contains provisions for performance bonds, which apply to all land
use or development. It includes, but is not limited to, zoning, subdivisions or
street improvements which are subject to regulation by the city:
   A.   Amount Required:
      1.   Construction Bond: A bond shall be posted with the city in a
principal amount of one hundred percent (100%) of the total estimated cost of
any performance which is promised to the city. The estimated cost shall be
based on the average cost paid by the city in the past for the same type of
performance, average unit bid prices as published by the Utah department of
transportation, or other resources which document costs for similar
performance. If at the time the bond amount is first calculated, or at any time
thereafter, it is foreseeable that the promised performance will take more than
one year to perform, the principal amount of the bond shall be increased by not
less than twenty five percent (25%) for each additional year of performance.
      2.   Warranty Bond: A bond shall be posted with the city in a principal
amount of ten percent (10%) of the construction bond total.
   B.   Type:
      1.   The construction bond shall be in the form of an irrevocable letter
of credit or cash on deposit with the city.
      2.   The warranty bond shall be in the form of cash on deposit with the
city.
   C.   Rights Of City: The terms of the bond shall give the city the
unqualified right, after default, to receive any part of the bond which is
necessary to complete the promised performance or to repair any inadequate
performance.
   D.   Terms Of Expiration: The bond, by its terms, shall not expire until the
city engineer has certified in writing that the promised performance is
completed. If the bond will expire prior to the completion of the bonded work,
the city engineer is authorized to declare the bond in default and have the
bond converted to a cash bond to be held by the city.
   E.   Enforcement: The city shall have the sole right to enforce the bond.
Private parties shall not be third party beneficiaries of the bond.
   F.   Partial Release: A bond may be partially released if the performance to
which it related has been satisfactorily completed; provided, that beyond work
completed, ten percent (10%) of the bond is retained to ensure completion of
the entire performance. A service charge may be charged to cover the actual
cost of processing the partial bond releases in the event of more than two (2)
partial releases. No charge will be made for the first two (2) partial
releases. A maximum of five (5) partial releases will be allowed.
   G.   Final Release: A bond may not be completely released until the city
engineer has certified in writing that the promised performance is completed.
      1.   Construction Bonds: A construction bond may not be completely
released until all performance guaranteed by the bond is completed. Upon
written approval by the city engineer, a new bond may be posted to guarantee
remaining items of performance, thus allowing a previous bond to be completely
released. Such replacement bonding must be in place prior to final release.
      2.   Warranty Bonds: A warranty bond may not be completely released until
all performance, guaranteed by the bond, is completed. A warranty bond provides
assurance of quality in the performance required by a construction bond. A time
period specified by the city engineer must pass before a warranty bond is
eligible for release. At the completion of this time period the required
performance is reviewed and any corrections needed are noted. Only when all
corrections noted are complete may the warranty bond be released. (Ord. 2010-3,
1-19-2010)

In order to assure orderly growth and development of the community and protect
the general interest of the taxpaying public as well as the rights of
individual property owners who wish to annex to the city, the following
specific guidelines are established:
   A.   Fee Policy: The city's policy of requiring subdividers and developers
to provide for improvements through a bond procedure or through a special
improvement district makes it unnecessary for the city to assess general impact
fees at the time of annexation. Developers will, however, be subject to
appropriate fees to offset the cost to the city for planning and supervision of
subdividing, and the providing of utilities, as those fees are provided through
ordinances of the city, or by resolution duly passed. A party annexing property
will likewise be charged for services of the city for preparation of the
annexation plat if that work is done by the city rather than by a private
engineer or surveyor.
   B.   Property Included: Every annexation include the greatest amount of
property possible.
      1.   Piecemeal annexation of individual small properties not be allowed
if contiguous parcels, soon to be developed, are available, in order to avoid
repetitious annexation.

lines in order to minimize the public expense for extension of main or service
lines and streets.
   C.   Utility Extensions Limited: City utilities and services not be extended
to unincorporated properties on the fringes of the city nor to islands of
unincorporated property. In order to provide for orderly growth and development
in the city and to avoid confusion and undue cost to the taxpayers, all utility
and service hookons shall be limited to incorporated areas of the city and
shall not be made available extraterritorially. The only exception shall be to
those extensions which are made pursuant to agreements with other units of
government under the interlocal government cooperation act, or by specific
approval of the municipal council on request of the city council.
   D.   Utilities To Annexed Areas: Utilities be extended to annexed areas as
soon as practicable after annexation.
      1.   Each annexation should require a disclosure by the developer of
anticipated needs of utilities and street improvements and a timetable of
anticipated development. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
      2.   Needed utilities be extended into the annexed area as soon as
practicable subject to budgetary limitations and that extensions of main and
service lines be chargeable to the property development rather than to the
public generally. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000; amd. 2003 Code)
11-17-2: ANNEXATION PROCEDURES:
Which one of the following annexation procedures are followed will be
determined by whether the property owner, or the city exercises the prerogative
of initiating the annexation:
   A.   Annexation By Property Owner: It is hereby recognized that the city's
policy shall be to allow the property owner contiguous to the city boundaries,
absent some reasonable public interest, to be and remain in control of both the
discretion as to whether to be annexed into the city and the timing in
conjunction with such annexation.

boundaries and each individual ownership sought to be annexed, including an
accurate legal description of the property to be annexed.
      3.   There shall be attached a statement as to the anticipated timetable
for development of the property being annexed. (Ord. 2000-23, 7-18-2000)
11-17-3: MUNICIPAL INITIATION OF ANNEXATION:
It shall be the policy of the city to annex unincorporated areas without a
petition if:
   A.   The annexation is an island within or a peninsula contiguous to the
municipality.
   B.   The majority of the area consists of residential or commercial
development.
   C.   The area proposed for annexation requires the delivery of municipal
