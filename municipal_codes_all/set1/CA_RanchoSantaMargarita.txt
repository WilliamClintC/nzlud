PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rancho Santa Margarita, California. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Orange County Code (OCC) as adopted by the City and ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The Code has been arranged in titles, and the various sections within each title have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Diana Harper, Senior Legal Technician/Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Deborah Wolff, City Clerk, and Mr. John Cavanaugh, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code that will make the active law of Rancho Santa Margarita readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of Rancho Santa Margarita's affairs.

Sec. 3.07.010. - Adoption of purchasing system. 
In order to establish efficient procedures for the purchase of goods and supplies, equipment, and services for the City at the lowest possible cost commensurate with quality needed, to exercise positive financial control over purchases, to clearly define authority for the purchasing function, and to assure the suitability and fitness of purchases, the purchasing system set forth in this chapter is adopted for the City of Rancho Santa Margarita. Except as otherwise provided herein, the procurement regulations, policies, and procedures set forth in this chapter shall apply only to the purchase of goods and supplies, equipment, and professional and nonprofessional services, and shall not apply to public works construction projects. Procedures and processes for the procurement of public works construction contracts are set forth in Chapter 3.08 and are subject to the California Public Contract Code. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.020. - Authority and responsibility; definitions. 
(a)  The authority and responsibility for the purchase of goods and supplies and equipment, procurement of professional and nonprofessional services, and disposition of surplus supplies and equipment, is vested in the City Manager and City Council. The Purchasing Officer shall be the City Manager or the City Manager's designee. The Purchasing Officer may promulgate additional administrative rules, procedures, and orders necessary to implement the policies and procedures established by this chapter with regard to the purchase of goods and supplies, equipment, and services on behalf of the City. Each City department head is responsible for administering and implementing for that department the purchasing policies and procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(b)  In addition to administering these policies and procedures, the Purchasing Officer and each City department head shall: 
(1)  Consider that the City Council has encouraged all residents and businesses located within the City to shop locally at businesses located in the City. In keeping with this policy, the Purchasing Officer should make every attempt to purchase goods and supplies and equipment from Rancho Santa Margarita businesses. Except as otherwise required by law, where other factors are equal, goods and supplies and equipment should be procured from Rancho Santa Margarita businesses. 
(2)  Keep informed of current developments in market conditions and new products and maintain a bidder's list, vendor catalogue files, or other records needed for the efficient purchase of goods and supplies, equipment, and services. 
(3)  Cause goods and supplies and equipment delivered to the City, as well as contract services, to be inspected or reviewed to determine their conformance with specifications. 
(4)  Evaluate contract services performed to determine conformance to the specifications set forth in the contract. 
(5)  Consider and encourage the purchase and use of recycled and recyclable materials and products, whenever practicable and cost effective or efficient. 
(c)  The term "City department head" as used in this chapter means the person who is designated by the City Manager as being responsible for each particular City department, including, but not limited to, Administration, Development Services, City Attorney, City Clerk, Community Services, Finance, Police Services, and Public Works. 
(d)  The term "estimated value" means the estimated total value as determined by the Purchasing Officer at the beginning of the procurement process for the proposed acquisition of goods and supplies, equipment, and services. When making this initial threshold determination, the Purchasing Officer shall make reasonable use of all available market data and pricing information to estimate the total cost to the City, inclusive of taxes, licenses, freight charges, installation charges, fees, and other consideration, for the proposed procurement. The Purchasing Officer shall not use the value of any anticipated exchange or trade-in amount to reduce the estimated value of the proposed procurement.

Sec. 3.07.030. - Determination of purchasing requirements and surplus. 
(a)  The City Council is responsible for and shall appropriate such funds as are necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter. The adopted budget for each City department for each fiscal year shall include funding for the necessary goods and supplies, equipment, and services for that department during the fiscal year. Except in cases of emergency, the City Manager shall not issue any purchase order or contract for goods and supplies, equipment, or services unless there exists an unencumbered appropriation in the department's account against which such purchase may be charged. The City Manager has the authority to transfer unencumbered funds between and among City departments and divisions as necessary for the procurement of goods and supplies, equipment, and services as necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Each City department head shall ensure that sufficient documentation is submitted to the Purchasing Officer with the proper purchase request form to demonstrate compliance with these policies and procedures and to justify the acquisition of goods and supplies, equipment, and services. 
(c)  Each City department head shall notify the City Manager of all equipment on hand in the department that is no longer useful to the department. The City Manager may direct the transfer of such equipment to another City department, or the trade-in, disposal, or donation of such surplus equipment in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.040. - Purchasing limitations. 
The procurement of goods and supplies, equipment, and nonprofessional services may be made by the employees designated in this section subject to compliance with the procedures and limitations contained in this section. 
(1)  For purchases of $150 or less, petty cash may be used and the respective City department head must approve the purchase. It is not required that quotes or bids be obtained for such purchases. 
(2)  For purchases that are greater than $150, up to and including $2,500, the respective City department head must approve the purchase. No purchase order is necessary, and it is not required that quotes or bids be obtained for such purchases. Requests for payment shall be made on forms prescribed and provided by the Purchasing Officer (check request forms). 
(3)  For purchases that have an estimated value greater than $2,500, up to and including $7,500, the Purchasing Officer shall approve and execute the purchase order or contract for the purchase.

(4)  For purchases that have an estimated value greater than $7,500, up to and including $30,000, the City Manager shall approve and execute the purchase order or contract for the purchase. Contracts shall be subject to approval as to form by the City Attorney. Before the purchase is made, three written informal bids must be obtained from vendors and each of these bids must be documented in accordance with Section 3.07.050. Verbal bids shall not satisfy this requirement. Requests for purchases shall be made on forms prescribed and provided by the Purchasing Officer (purchase requisition forms and purchase order forms). 
(5)  For purchases that have an estimated value greater than $30,000, the City Council shall approve the purchase order or contract for the purchase. Contracts shall be subject to approval as to form by the City Attorney. Prior to City Council approval, three written formal bids must be obtained from prospective vendors in accordance with Section 3.07.060. Verbal bids shall not satisfy this requirement. The City Council may authorize that such purchase orders or contracts be executed by either the Mayor or the City Manager, or the City Council may otherwise delegate such signature authority. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.050. - Competitive informal bidding procedures. 
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, for purchases of goods and supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services that have an estimated value greater than $7,500, up to and including $30,000, at least three informal bids or proposals must be obtained, and each City department shall solicit such informal bids or proposals by written request to qualified prospective bidders or proposers. The purchase order or contract for such purchases shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder consistent with the best qualified vendor selection criteria set forth in Section 3.07.111. Informal bids or proposals shall be submitted to the requesting City department, which shall keep a record of all informal orders and bids for a period of no less than two years after placement of the order. This record, while kept, shall be open to public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.060. - Competitive formal bidding procedures. 
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, for purchases of goods and supplies, equipment, and nonprofessional services that have an estimated value greater than $30,000, such procurements shall be let by the formal procedures set forth in this section. 
(1)  Notice inviting bids. Notices inviting formal bids from prospective vendors shall be publicly noticed and posted and mailed no later than ten calendar days before the submission date for formal bids. The notices shall describe the requested goods or supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services in general terms, how to obtain more detailed information concerning the procurement, and state the time, place, and deadline for submission of sealed bids. The notices shall be mailed to all qualified vendors on the bid list or who have requested their name to be added to thereto. 
(2)  Public notice. The notice inviting formal bids shall be noticed in any generally accepted manner of public notification and posted in at least three public places in the City that have been duly designated by the City Clerk as the official places for the posting of public notices and on the City's official website. In addition, such notice may include trade publications when practicable. 
(3)  Bid opening procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the office of the City Clerk and shall be identified as formal competitive bids on the outside of the sealed envelope. The City Clerk shall store all sealed bids in a secure location until opening. The City Clerk shall open all bids in public at the time and place stated in the notice inviting bids. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public review and inspection in the office of the City Clerk during regular business hours for a period of not less than 30 calendar days after the bid opening. 
(4)  Rejection of bids. In its sole discretion, the City Council may reject any and all bids for any reason or for no reason, and may suspend, delay, or otherwise cancel the procurement, or may order the re-advertisement of the request for bids. If all formal bids are rejected and the City Council resolves by a recorded majority vote of the total membership of the City Council that the procurement can be performed more economically by informal procedures or through open market purchases, then it may dispense with further formal competitive formal bidding. 
(5)  Tie bids. If two or more formal bids received are the same and are the lowest, the City Council may accept the one it chooses. 
(6)  Award of contracts. Contracts shall be awarded by the City Council to the lowest responsible bidder consistent with the best qualified vendor selection criteria set forth in Section 3.07.111. The decision of the City Council shall be final. 
(7)  No bids received. If no bids are received, the purchase may be let in the open market or by the informal procedures set forth in Section 3.07.050, subject to City Council approval. 
(8)  Performance bonds. The Purchasing Officer shall have authority to recommend that a performance bond or other form of security or guarantee be required before entering into a contract in such amount as may be reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the City. If a performance bond or other form of security or guarantee is required, the form and amount of the bond, security or guarantee shall be described in the notice inviting bids, and the performance bond, security or guarantee shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney. 
(9)  Defects, irregularities, and informalities. The City Council may, in its sole discretion, waive any defect, irregularity, or informality in the formal bids or in the competitive procedures established in this section, and no such defect, irregularity, or informality shall void any contract entered into by the City. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.070. - Exemption from bidding upon determination of Purchasing Officer or City Council. 
Except as otherwise provided below, the requirements and procedures set forth in Sections 3.07.050 and 3.07.060 may be waived, at the discretion of the Purchasing Officer or City Council, when any of the following are applicable: 
(1)  When goods and supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services are of a unique, sole source nature because of their quality, durability, availability, or fitness for a particular use and are available only from one source. A sole source procurement is a procurement where only one source is practicably available for the type of procurement required; 
(2)  When the goods and supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services are proprietary. A proprietary procurement is a procurement where the desired good or service must be restricted to one manufacturer because the good or service is compatible with or is an integral component of existing equipment or products, is necessary to support a specific need of a program, is covered by patent or copyright, must yield continuity of results, or is one with which a user has extensive experience and the use of any other similar good or service would require considerable reorientation and training. Under such circumstances, an equitable evaluation of comparable goods or services should be made showing that rejection of other goods or services is based solely on their failure to meet that need; 
(3)  When after a reasonable attempt has been made to obtain informal bids or proposals, and it has been determined by the Purchasing Officer that three informal bids or proposals cannot be obtained; 
(4)  When the Purchasing Officer finds that emergency conditions require the immediate purchase of goods and supplies, equipment, or services. For purposes of this section, emergency purchases are those procurements that are required to prevent immediate interruption or cessation of necessary City services or to safeguard life, property, or the public health and welfare. The Purchasing Officer shall file promptly with the City Council a report showing such conditions and the necessity for such action, together with an itemized account of all expenditures; 
(5)  When in the opinion of the Purchasing Officer competitive formal bidding is not likely to result in the lowest price; 
(6)  When in the opinion of the Purchasing Officer a specific make, model, or brand is necessary to match existing city goods and supplies or equipment or to facilitate the continuity of effective maintenance and support; 
(7)  When the goods and supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services are available from a vendor who has been selected as the lowest bidder through a procurement with another government entity using competitive bidding procedures substantially the same as or similar to those normally utilized by the City for the acquisition of such goods and supplies, equipment, or services, and when the price offered to the City is substantially equivalent to that offered to the other public agency; 
(8)  When the goods and supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services are available from suppliers who have been awarded contracts by the State of California for the purchase of goods and supplies, information technology, and services where State procurement is made in the form of master agreements, price schedules, or multiple award schedules that allow the State to take advantage of leveraged pricing that can be obtained through the State's buying power and where the State has determined that such vendor pricing is deemed to be reasonable, fair, and competitive. Pursuant to such State multiple award programs, the Purchasing Officer or City Council may make these purchases directly from the vendors without competitive bidding, or the State may provide assistance to the City in making such purchases; 
(9)  When in the opinion of the Purchasing Officer it is determined that an unusual or unique situation exists, in that due to experience, specialized qualifications, the unique nature of the goods and supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services, particular expertise, performance history, and/or reputation, a particular vendor is uniquely qualified for a particular task or project, which makes application of the requirements for competitive solicitation under this chapter contrary to either the intended purpose of the project or the public interest; 
(10)  When in the opinion of the City Council, it is determined that compliance with the requirements and procedures is not in the best interest of the City; 
(11)  When goods and supplies, equipment, or nonprofessional services are for information technology, computer hardware, software, or related equipment and devices, government affairs, public relations, legislative advocacy or affairs, or economic development, irrespective of their estimated value, such procurements shall be subject to the informal bidding procedures set forth in Section 3.07.050. 
(12)  When goods and supplies, equipment, and professional or nonprofessional services are for any of the following, irrespective of their estimated value, such procurements shall not be subject to the informal or formal bidding procedures set forth in Sections 3.07.050 or 3.07.060, or the procedures set forth in Section 3.07.080, but are otherwise subject to the purchasing limitations set forth in this chapter: 
a.  Contracts for professional or other expert witnesses if the purpose of such contracts is to provide for professional services or testimony relating to an existing or probable judicial proceeding in which the City is or may become a party, including contracts for special investigative services; 
b.  Contracts to commission original works of art, and for fine art or any form of public art; 
c.  The purchase of miscellaneous books, magazines, newspapers, subscriptions, on-line library reference services, film, videos, and assorted materials; 
d.  Intergovernmental payments, purchases, and agreements, including but not limited to contracts for the procurement of law enforcement or other public safety services; 
e.  Specialized seminar, training, and educational classes; 
f.  Contracts for election services; 
g.  Contracts for appraisal services; 
h.  Contracts for entertainment services; 
i.  Contracts for community support and/or recreation services; 
j.  Contracts for printing and/or graphical design services. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.080. - Professional services contracts, exempt from competitive bidding. 
(a)  The informal and formal bidding procedures contained in this chapter shall not apply to contracts for professional services. Rather, to secure professional services, the City shall utilize a request for proposals procedure, which may be promulgated by the Purchasing Officer in the form of administrative regulations. The Purchasing Officer may award any contract for professional services when the total not to exceed contract amount of such services is $30,000 or less. Any contract for professional services having an aggregate contract amount greater than $30,000 shall be awarded by the City Council, and the City Council may authorize that such contracts be executed by either the Mayor or the City Manager, or the City Council may otherwise delegate such signature authority. 
(b)  For purposes of this chapter, the term professional services means those services provided by any specially trained and/or experienced person, company, corporation, or firm in areas including but not limited to private architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, environmental, land surveying, construction project management, management and administration, financial, accounting, auditing, actuarial, and/or development and planning, which involve the exercise of discretion and independent judgment together with an advanced or specialized knowledge, expertise, training, or unique skills gained by formal studies or experience. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary: 
(1)  Selection by the City of professional services in areas including but not limited to private architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, environmental, land surveying, construction project management, management and administration, financial, accounting, auditing, actuarial, and/or development and planning, which involve the exercise of discretion and independent judgment together with an advanced or specialized knowledge, expertise, training, or unique skills gained by formal studies or experience, shall be on the basis of demonstrated competence and on the professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required, and shall not be awarded solely on the basis of cost. 
(2)  In order to implement this method of selection, the Purchasing Officer may promulgate administrative regulations concerning contracting for professional services to ensure that such services are engaged on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the types of services to be performed and at fair and reasonable prices to the City. In accordance with State law, the City shall consider price after the City is satisfied that the would-be person, company, corporation, contractor, consultant, or firm has demonstrated the competence and professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required. Price alone shall not be the determining factor, but shall be considered along with qualifications. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all contracts for the performance of the annual audit of the City financial statements shall be competitively bid by the Purchasing Officer by utilizing the informal competitive bidding method set forth in Section 3.07.050 and by evaluating the bids or proposals received and making the contract award in accordance with the selection criteria set forth in subsection (2) above. The award of all contracts for municipal financial audit services, regardless of cost, shall be approved by the City Council. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.090. - Prohibited activity. 
City officers and employees are prohibited from engaging in any unlawful activity in the procurement of goods and supplies, equipment, and services, including, but not limited to, receipt of any form of compensation, rebates, kickbacks, or any other unlawful consideration. City officers and employees are prohibited from participating in the selection process when those persons have a financial interest in the purchase or contract as proscribed in Government Code Section 1090 et seq. or 87100 et seq. 
(Ord. No. 15-01, § 1, 5-13-2015)  
Sec. 3.07.100. - Change orders; contract amendments. 
(a)  Following the award of a contract or issuance of a purchase order for goods and supplies, equipment, services, or public works construction contracts, the contract or purchase order may be amended by the issuance of a change order or contract amendment. A change order may be issued provided that the change is reasonably related to the scope of the original contract. An amendment to a contract is required when the subject of the change order alters or is outside the scope of the original contract. 
(b)  The Purchasing Officer will maintain control relative to the scoping, estimating, and negotiating of the proposed change(s) of a change order or contract amendment. The Finance Director will certify the availability of funds for the proposed change(s) in the event the change increases the contract cost. 
(c)  Any public works construction contract change order where the original contract cost is in the amount of $30,000 or less may be approved by the Purchasing Officer, provided the aggregate amount of all changes to that particular contract, including the change order under consideration, does not exceed $30,000. Any change order to a public works construction contract with an original contract amount greater than $30,000, or any change order that, when considered with the aggregate amount of all other changes to that particular contract, exceeds ten percent of the original contract cost, shall be approved by the City Council. For public works construction contracts greater than $30,000, the Purchasing Officer shall notify the City Council of change orders that have been issued for public works construction contracts pursuant to this section at the time the notice of completion is issued. 
(d)  Any change order or contract amendment to a contract for goods and supplies, equipment, or professional or nonprofessional services where the original contract cost is in the amount of $30,000 or less may be approved by the Purchasing Officer, provided that the aggregate cost resulting from the original contract and all change orders or amendments to such contract, including the change order or amendment under consideration, does not exceed $30,000. If the change order or contract amendment would cause the aggregate cost of the contract to exceed $30,000, it shall be approved by the City Council. All contract amendments shall be approved as to form by the City Attorney. 
(e)  If a proposed contract amendment, change order, or request for extra work exceeds the limitations imposed upon the Purchasing Officer by this section or by regulation, and if any extended delay in obtaining City Council approval is reasonably determined to subject the City to liability for damages incurred by a contractor, or to jeopardize the public health, welfare, or safety, or to otherwise result in potential detriment to the City, then the Purchasing Officer shall have authority to exceed the dollar amounts or other limitations specified herein. The Purchasing Officer shall file promptly with the City Council a report showing such conditions and the necessity for such action, together with an itemized account of all expenditures.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 17-01, § 2, adopted March 22, 2017, repealed the former Ch. 4.02, §§ 4.02.0104.02.090, and enacted a new Ch. 4.02 as set out herein. The former Ch. 4.02 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 10-02, § 1, 4-14-2010. 
 
Sec. 4.02.010. - Findings and purpose. 
The City Council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this Chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City. 
(2)  The City is authorized, by virtue of Section 7 of Article XI of the California Constitution, California Business and Professions Code §§ 460(c), 4612(b) and 16000, and California Government Code § 51030 et seq., as may be amended from time to time, to regulate massage establishments by imposing reasonable conditions on the operation of massage establishments. 
(3)  There is a significant risk of injury to massage clients by improperly trained and/or educated massage technicians and this Chapter provides reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss. 
(4)  Massage establishments present an opportunity for acts of prostitution, human trafficking, and the use and sale of illegal drugs. Such illegal activity has been documented by police reports in cities in Orange County, including but not limited to Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, and Lake Forest, which have several massage establishments. Courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that some massage establishments are brothels in disguise. The enactment of reasonable standards and restrictions on the operation of massage establishments will serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity. 
(5)  The regulations and restrictions contained in this Chapter reduce the burdens on the City's police personnel and permit the deployment of the police personnel such that more serious crimes may be prevented and more important laws be enforced. 
(6)  The regulations and restrictions contained in this Chapter tend to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution or sites for illegal drug use and sales; the means utilized in this Chapter bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved.

Sec. 5.05.010. - Legislative finding. 
The City Council finds and declares that tobacco smoking is a hazard to the health of the general public. Studies clearly demonstrate that smoking is a hazard to the health of those who smoke. Smoking is responsible for the premature death of approximately 3,000 Orange County residents each year from lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory illness, and other diseases. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded that secondhand tobacco smoke is a human carcinogen and responsible for over 3,000 lung cancer deaths in nonsmoking adults each year. Therefore, secondhand smoke is a proven health hazard to those who are present in confined spaces. In order to serve the public health, safety and welfare, the declared purpose of this division is to prohibit the smoking of tobacco, or any weed or plant, in buildings or motor vehicles owned or leased by the City and in City spaces in buildings partially leased by the City, and in certain other places subject to the jurisdiction or control of the City, except as otherwise provided in this division. In addition, the City Council declares that vending machines that sell or distribute tobacco products contribute to the onset of tobacco use. Studies have found that 90 percent of all current smokers become addicted by the age of 19. Therefore, the U.S. Secretary of Health, the U.S. Surgeon General, and leading voluntary health organizations all recommend the elimination of such vending machines in public places for health reasons.

(Ord. No. 06-01, § 1, 1-11-2006)  
Sec. 5.06.240. - Suspension, revocation, renewal and transfer of permit. 
(a)  Summary suspension of permit. It shall be unlawful for a permittee to collect solid waste in the City during such time as the permit of the said permittee is suspended. The City shall have authority to summarily suspend a permit issued pursuant to this Article whenever the permittee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit or violates any provision of this Chapter or other City ordinance. The City shall notify the permittee in writing of such summary suspension, which notice shall also advise the permittee of the time and place of a hearing before the City Council to consider the termination of the permit pursuant to Subsection (b). The hearing before the City Council shall be held not less than ten nor more than 30 days from the date of such notice. 
(b)  Council hearing on revocation of permit. 
(1)  Any permit issued or granted pursuant to the provisions of this Article may be revoked after a public hearing before the City Council. It is unlawful for any solid waste collector to operate under a permit that has been revoked or suspended. A permit may be revoked under the following circumstances: 
a.  Where it has been determined that the permittee has violated or has failed to comply with any of the terms or conditions of the permit, including failing to file a complete, timely and accurate quarterly report; 
b.  Where it has been determined that the permittee has violated or has failed to comply with any ordinances, resolutions, or regulations of the City, or of state or federal law, applicable to collection and disposal of solid waste;

Any hearing may be continued or adjourned to a stated time and place without the giving of further notice. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Council may revoke a permit upon the adoption of a resolution which sets forth in writing the findings relied on to conclude that the permit shall be revoked. The resolution revoking the permit shall set forth the notice required by Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. The City Council's decision shall be final. 
(4)  The City, without a hearing, may suspend a permit for not more than 60 days, if the City Manager or City Manager's designee finds that continued operation by the permittee will constitute a threat to public health, safety, or general welfare. 
(c)  Waiver of hearing. Failure of permittee to respond to a notice to appear for a hearing before the board is a waiver of the right to a hearing and action may be taken without the permittee being present. 
(d)  Confiscation of solid waste permit items. The City may take possession of any badge, card, permit, or license, issued under the provisions of this Chapter, upon expiration, revocation, cancellation, or suspension thereof, or which is fictitious or which has been unlawfully or erroneously issued.

(Ord. No. 06-01, § 1, 1-11-2006)  
Sec. 5.06.250. - Operations under solid waste permit. 
(a)  Scope of solid waste permit. A solid waste permit issued pursuant to this article shall authorize only the following activities: 
(1)  Collection of source separated recyclable solid waste; provided that transformation, mixed waste processing, or other collection or processing methods that do not require prior separation of recyclable solid waste from the waste generated by the waste generator prior to collection by the permittee shall not be considered the collection of recyclable solid waste. 
(2)  Temporary collection services, such as solid waste collection from specific projects such as yard clean-up, remodeling, construction, or demolition, as more fully defined under the definitions of "temporary collection service" and "temporary collection containers." 
(b)  Notice for non-collection. When any solid waste is left on premises by the permittee, the permittee shall at that time leave a red tag indicating the reasons for refusing to collect the solid waste, and giving reference to the City ordinance which provides permittee grounds for such refusal. The tag shall carry the permittee's business or firm name and telephone number and shall be securely fastened to the container or the Article refused. Permittee shall keep a record of such notices including the addresses of all premises where it is necessary to leave such notices.

Sec. 5.06.260. - Reserved.  
Sec. 5.06.270. - Solid waste permit fees. 
Permittees shall submit the following fees within 30 days of the end of the preceding quarter, for quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, accompanied with the quarterly reports detailed in Section 5.06.300: 
(1)  Permit fee. Permittee will submit five percent of the gross receipts collected for all solid waste services provided in the City during the preceding calendar quarter ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. 
(2)  AB 939 fee. In addition to the permit fee, permittee will submit ten percent of gross receipts collected for all solid waste services provided in the City during the preceding calendar quarter ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, if the permittee does not divert a minimum of 60 percent of the material it collects. A permittee that does not divert 60 percent of the waste it collects may have the opportunity to demonstrate that it took all reasonable actions to divert the maximum amount of solid waste it collected and that 60 percent diversion was not possible due to the unique characteristics of the loads collected. The City, in its sole discretion, shall determine if the AB 939 fee shall be waived. 
(3)  Late fees. Permittee shall pay to the City a service charge, in an amount equal to ten percent of any amount due City after due date has passed. Permittee shall pay an additional ten percent service charge on any unpaid balance for each additional 30-day period the fees remain unpaid.

Sec. 5.06.280. - Permittee diversion requirements. 
Permittees must divert a minimum of 60 percent of the solid waste that the permittee collects within the City each calendar year. Fees paid by permittees are reduced relative to the level of waste diversion achieved by each permittee. To count as waste diversion for the purpose of this Chapter, the permittee must provide documentation of delivery to a recycling facility and documentation as to the quantity of the delivered waste that was diverted. Failure to meet this requirement over one calendar quarter is grounds to deny issuance of, suspend and/or revoke a solid waste collection permit. A permittee that does not divert 60 percent of the waste it collects may have the opportunity to demonstrate that it took all reasonable actions to divert the maximum amount of solid waste it collected and that 60 percent diversion was not possible due to the unique characteristics of the loads collected. The City, in its sole discretion, may determine whether such permit will be continued or renewed. Diversion rates under 50 percent during one calendar quarter will result in the automatic revocation of the permit. 
If, in the future, the California Integrated Waste Management Board passes legislation through the State Senate or the State Assembly, requiring that cities divert more than 60 percent of the solid waste, each permittee shall be required to meet the new State requirements.

(1)  Comprehensive general liability; 
(2)  Automobile liability; and 
(3)  Workers' compensation and employers' liability.

The insurance policy or policies shall be issued by an admitted insurance company with a Best Key Rating of A VII, or as otherwise acceptable to the City. The above limits shall be subject to approval of and to annual review by the City for the purpose of reasonably adjusting to current insurance conditions and requirements. 
(c)  Such insurance shall be primary and not excess, shall be procured from an insurer authorized to do business in the State, and shall not be cancelled or modified without first giving to the City 30 days' prior written notice. 
(d)  All such insurance shall remain in effect, uninterrupted, through the term of the permit. Applicants and permittees shall provide the City with certificates of insurance annually with the solid waste and recyclables collection permit application. 
(e)  All such insurance shall name the City as an additional insured in a separate endorsement.

Each permittee shall make records available to the City or to agents of the City during normal business hours at the permittee's local office upon one business day's notice from the City. Should the audit of the permittee's books and records show more than a $1,000.00 discrepancy between fees paid and fees due for a one-year period, the permittee shall reimburse the City for the cost of the audit. The City has the option to review a period less than a year and annualize the results. Over or under-paid fees shall be remitted within 30 days of the finalization of the review, or of discovery if determination is made outside of a review by the City.

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 10-07, § 1, adopted November 10, 2010, amended Chapter 5.10 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, Chapter 5.10 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 04-01, § 2, adopted May 28, 2004. 
 
Sec. 5.10.010. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe regulations as mandated by the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq., as amended, including § 402(p)) to effectively prohibit non-stormwater discharges into the storm sewers and to reduce the discharge of pollutants. Human activities, such as agriculture, construction, and the operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure, may result in undesirable discharges of pollutants and certain sediments that may accumulate in local drainage channels and waterways and eventually may be deposited into waters of the United States. This chapter will improve water quality by controlling the pollutants that enter the network of storm drains throughout the City of Rancho Santa Margarita. This chapter also establishes legal authority to establish and enforce best management practices to ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens, and protect and enhance the water quality of watercourses and water bodies in a manner pursuant to and consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) by preventing or minimizing non-stormwater discharges to the stormwater drainage system. 
(b)  The Clean Water Act mandates, in part, that municipal separate storm sewer systems, such as in Orange County, obtain permits to "effectively prohibit non-storm water discharges into the storm sewers" and "require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable." This permitting authority has been delegated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the State of California, which has authorized the California Water Resources Control Board and its local regulatory agencies, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards, to control non-point source discharges to California's waterways. 
(c)  The San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board has addressed the obligation to implement the Clean Water Act by issuing a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") Permit governing stormwater runoff for the County of Orange, Orange County Flood Control District, and certain of the incorporated cities of Orange County. The City of Rancho Santa Margarita is participating as a "Co-permittee" under the NPDES Permit. 
(Ord. No. 10-07, § 1, 11-10-2010)  
Sec. 5.10.020. - Findings. 
(a)  The City of Rancho Santa Margarita is authorized by California Constitution Article XI, Section 7 to exercise the police power of the State to adopt regulations protecting the public health and public safety. 
(b)  The City of Rancho Santa Margarita has determined that a legitimate local purpose is present in complying with the provisions of the NPDES Permit. 
(c)  A reduction in stormwater borne pollution will promote the public health and protect the general welfare of the City by reducing the level of artificial and naturally occurring constituents, which may improve the quality of the waters in this region. 
(d)  The land use authority exercised by the City of Rancho Santa Margarita, pursuant to Government Code Section 65300 et seq., requires regional planning and the adoption of policies protecting the environment through the imposition of reasonable conditions on the use of land. 
(e)  This chapter conforms to the policies and goals of the General Plan adopted by the City of Rancho Santa Margarita, pursuant to California Planning and Zoning Law, for the protection of the portions of watersheds located within Orange County by implementing measures to control erosion, prevent the pollution of streams and other waters, and, to the maximum extent practicable, reduce the discharge of pollutants and runoff flow from urban development. 
(f)  The Subdivision Map Act, Government Code Section 66410 et seq., authorizes the City of Rancho Santa Margarita to regulate and control the design and improvement of subdivided lands and mitigate the burdens of proposed development by imposing reasonable conditions on map approval; 
(g)  California Constitution Article XI, Section 7 and Government Code Section 38660 authorize the City of Rancho Santa Margarita to establish appropriate conditions for the issuance of building permits, which require the installation of improvements reasonably related to the proposed use of property. 
(h)  Government Code Section 38771 authorizes the City of Rancho Santa Margarita to declare as public nuisances undesirable acts which may injure health or cause interference with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property and to provide for the abatement of the same. 
(i)  The City of Rancho Santa Margarita may commence civil actions, pursuant to 33 U.S.C. Section 1365(a), against any person, private entity, or governmental agency acting in violation of any condition of the NPDES Permit. 
(j)  All industrial dischargers subject to the provisions of the State Industrial General Stormwater Permit and Construction General Permit (referred to collectively herein as the "State general permits") must comply with the lawful requirements of the City of Rancho Santa Margarita, which regulate discharges of stormwater to the storm drain system within its jurisdiction. 
(k)  All industrial dischargers subject to the provisions of the State general permits are required to maintain State-approved Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans with active Waste Discharge Identification Numbers on-site and make them available to the City of Rancho Santa Margarita for inspection.

(m)  All industrial dischargers subject to the provisions of the State Industrial General Stormwater Permit are required to maintain a description of the required monitoring program on-site and make it available to the City of Rancho Santa Margarita for inspection. 
(n)  The City of Rancho Santa Margarita has jurisdiction over certain stormwater facilities and other watercourses within the City of Rancho Santa Margarita, and the water discharges into these facilities may be subject to the provisions of the State Industrial General Stormwater Permit; accordingly, the City of Rancho Santa Margarita may certify (but is not required to certify) in writing that regulated dischargers have developed and implemented effective Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans. 
(o)  The City of Rancho Santa Margarita has jurisdiction over certain stormwater facilities and other watercourses within the City of Rancho Santa Margarita, and these facilities may receive stormwater discharges from properties and activities regulated under the provisions of the State general permits, and the City of Rancho Santa Margarita may request that the regulated dischargers furnish information and records necessary to determine compliance with the State general permits and may, upon presentation of credentials and other documents required by law: 
(1)  Enter upon the discharger's premises where a regulated facility is located or where records must be kept under the conditions of the State general permits; 
(2)  Access and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the State general permits; 
(3)  Inspect, at reasonable times, any facility or equipment related to or impacting stormwater discharge; and 
(4)  Sample or monitor for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the State general permits.

In awarding these contracts, the Orange County Fire Authority, or City if it elects to retain licensee selection and contracting authority, shall consider the comparative value of competing proposals in the same fashion as would be the case were the County evaluating proposals from prospective service providers for other governmental activities, including consideration of:

(d)  No person shall provide ambulance service in response to, or as a result of, an emergency, unless that person is a licensee specified in each instance by a physician or public safety agency. A licensee thus specified by a physician need not be a contractor selected pursuant to this section.

Pending such impoundment and/or abatement hearing and decision by the Director, the Director may order the owner and/or custodian to keep the dog within a substantial enclosure or securely attached to a chain or other type of control which the Director may deem necessary under the circumstances.

The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions.

The owner shall, in addition, notify the new owner and/or custodian in writing of the details of the dog's record, terms and conditions of maintenance and provide the Director with a copy thereof containing an acknowledgement by the new owner and/or custodian of his or her receipt of the original.

The imposition of any such different or additional restrictions or conditions shall be subject to the same notice, hearing and other procedural requirements as required for imposing an initial abatement and/or impoundment set forth in subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this Section. 
(g)  Possession unlawful. It is unlawful to have custody of, own or possess a vicious dog or potentially dangerous dog unless the dog is restrained, confined or muzzled so that it cannot bite, attack or cause injury to any person or property.

Sec. 9.04.030. - Adult businesses. 
(a)  Statement of purpose. It is the intent of this Section to prevent community-wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools, churches, parks, public facilities and residentially zoned districts or uses. The City Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Section to: 
(1)  Establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses; and 
(2)  To mitigate the negative secondary effects of adult businesses, while permitting the location of adult businesses in certain areas to comply with existing legal standards. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Except as otherwise specified, as used herein, the terms and phrases shall have the same meaning as defined in Chapter 6.10. 
(2)  Establishment of an adult business. To "establish" an adult business shall be defined to include any of the following: 
a.  The opening or commencement of any adult business as a new business; 
b.  The conversion of an existing business, whether or not an adult business, to any adult business defined herein; 
c.  The addition of any of the adult businesses defined herein to any other existing adult business; or 
d.  The relocation of any such adult business. 
(c)  Minimum proximity requirements. No adult business shall be established or located in any zoning district in the City other than the business park zoning district, and subject to the distance requirements of certain specified land uses or zones as set forth below: 
(1)  No such business shall be established or located within 1,000 feet of any other adult business. 
(2)  No such business shall be established or located within 1,000 feet from any existing residential zoning district or use, park, church or school. 
(3)  The distances set forth above shall be measured as a radius from the primary entrance of the adult business to the property lines of the property so zoned without regard to intervening structures.

(7)  The requirements of this Section are minimum requirements and shall not preclude a residential development from providing additional affordable units or affordable units with lower rents or sales prices than required by this Section. 
(8)  In accordance with State law, neither the granting of an incentive or concession nor the granting of a density bonus shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, zoning code amendment or rezone, or other discretionary review application approval. 
(e)  State density bonus for land donation. 
(1)  When an applicant for a residential development seeks a density bonus for the donation and transfer of land for the development of units affordable to very-low income households, as provided for in this Section, the residential development shall be eligible for a 15 percent density bonus above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density in accordance with State law. For each one percent increase above the minimum ten percent land donation described in Subsection (e)(2), the maximum density bonus shall be increased by one percent, up to a maximum of 35 percent. This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density allowed by Subsection (d), up to a maximum combined density bonus of 35 percent if an applicant seeks both the density bonus authorized by this Section and the density bonus authorized by Subsection (d). When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded to the next larger whole number. This density bonus applies only when land is donated for the construction of very-low income housing. 
(2)  The City may approve the density bonus described in this Section if it makes all of the following findings when approving the residential development: 
a.  The applicant will donate and transfer the land no later than the date of approval of the final map, parcel map, or applicable development review application for the residential development. 
b.  The developable acreage and zoning regulations of the applicable zoning district of the land to be transferred will permit construction of units affordable to very-low income households in an amount not less than ten percent of the total number of residential units in the proposed development, or will permit construction of a greater percentage of units if proposed by the developer to qualify for a density bonus of more than 15 percent. 
c.  The transferred land is at least one acre in size or is large enough to permit development of at least 40 units, has the appropriate General Plan land use designation, has the appropriate zoning and development standards to make feasible the development of very-low income housing, and at the time of project approval is, or at the time of construction will be, served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure. 
d.  No later than the date of approval of the final map, parcel map, or other applicable development review application for the residential development, the transferred land will have all of the applicable development permits and approvals, other than any required building permit approval, necessary for the development of the very-low incomes housing units on the transferred land unless the City Council finds that the applicant has provided specific assurances guaranteeing the timely completion of the very-low income units, including satisfactory assurances that construction and permanent financing will be secured for the construction of the units within a reasonable time. 
e.  The transferred land and the very low income units constructed on the land will be subject to a recorded density bonus housing agreement ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with the density bonus housing agreement, which restriction shall be filed for recordation by the Development Services Director with the Orange County Recorder's Office on the property at the time of dedication. 
f.  The land will be transferred to the City or to a housing developer approved by the City. The City reserves the right to require the applicant to identify a developer for the very-low income units and to require that the land be transferred to that developer. 
g.  The transferred land is within the site boundaries of the proposed residential development. The transferred land may be located within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed residential development provided that the City Council finds, based on substantial evidence, that off-site donation will provide as much or more affordable housing at the same or even lower income levels, and of the same or superior quality of design and construction, and will otherwise provide greater public benefit, than donating land on site. 
(f)  State density bonus or incentive or concession for day care centers. 
(1)  A residential development that includes at least five dwelling units; includes affordable target units and includes a day care center that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to the residential development, is eligible for either of the following, at the option of the City, and if requested by the applicant in accordance with State law: 
a.  A density bonus in addition to those permitted by Subsections (d) and (e) that is equal to the square footage of the gross floor area of the day care center; or 
b.  An additional incentive or concession that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the day care center. 
(2)  The City may approve the density bonus or incentive or concession described in this Section if it makes all of the following findings and requires as a condition of approval that: 
a.  The day care center will remain in operation for a period of time equal to or longer than the period of time during which the target units are required to remain affordable pursuant to the density bonus housing agreement. 
b.  Of all children who attend the day care center, the percentage of children of very-low income households, lower-income households, or moderate-income households shall be equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are proposed to be affordable to very low income households, lower-income households, or moderate-income households in the residential development. 
c.  The applicant shall be responsible for all costs of monitoring compliance with these provisions.

(1)  An applicant shall be eligible for either a density bonus or other incentives or concessions of equivalent financial value in accordance with State law if the applicant for a conversion of existing rental apartments to condominiums agrees to provide 33 percent of the total units of the proposed condominium project as target units affordable to households with moderate incomes or less, or to provide 15 percent of the total units in the condominium conversion project as target units affordable to lower-income households. All such target units shall remain affordable for the period specified in the density bonus housing agreement. 
(2)  For purposes of this Subsection, a density bonus means an increase in units of 25 percent over the number of units to be provided within the existing structure or structures proposed for conversion. 
(3)  No condominium conversion shall be eligible for a density bonus if the apartments proposed for conversion constitute a housing development for which a density bonus or other incentives or concessions were previously provided pursuant to this Chapter or Government Code § 65915.

Sec. 9.05.050. - Fuel modification standards. 
(a)  Purpose. Special regulations are necessary to ensure public safety and reduce fire damage to structures located in areas subject to risk from wildland fires. The primary purpose of the fuel modification standards is to reduce the level of risk from wildland fires by removal of native flammable vegetation and replacement with drought-tolerant, fire-resistant plants that reduce radiant and convective heat. This planting program will provide fire-suppression forces and a safe area in which to take an action to protect life and property. 
(b)  Applicability.

(2)  Irrigation of all landscaped areas shall be conducted in a manner conforming to the rules and requirements, and shall be subject to penalties and incentives for water conservation and water waste prevention as determined and implemented by the local water purveyor or as mutually agreed by the local water purveyor and the City. 
(e)  Delegation. The City may delegate to, or enter into a contract with, a local agency to implement, administer, and/or enforce any of the provisions of this Section on behalf of the City. 
(f)  Definitions. The following definitions are applicable to this Section: 
Applied water means the portion of water supplied by the irrigation system to the landscape. 
Budget-based tiered-rate structure means tiered or block rates for irrigation accounts charged by the retail water agency in which the block definition for each customer is derived from lot size or irrigated area and the evapotranspiration requirements of landscaping. 
Ecological restoration project means a project where the site is intentionally altered to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem. 
Estimated applied water use means the average annual total amount of water estimated to be necessary to keep plants in a healthy state, calculated as provided in the Guidelines. It is based on the reference evapotranspiration rate, the size of the landscape area, plant water use factors, and the relative irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system. 
ET adjustment factor or ETAF is equal to the plant factor divided by the irrigation efficiency factor for a landscape project, as described in the Guidelines. The ETAF is calculated in the context of local reference evapotranspiration, using site-specific plant factors and irrigation efficiency factors that influence the amount of water that needs to be applied to the specific landscaped area. 
A combined plant mix with a site-wide average plant factor of 0.5 (indicating a moderate water need) and average irrigation efficiency of 0.71 produces an ET adjustment factor of (0.7) = (0.5/0.71), which is the standard of water use efficiency generally required by this Section and the Guidelines, except that the ETAF for a special landscape area shall not exceed 1.0. 
Guidelines refers to the Guidelines for Implementation of the Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance, as adopted by the City Council, and as subsequently amended by resolution of the City Council, which describes procedures, calculations, and requirements for landscape projects subject to this Section. 
Hardscapes means any durable material or feature (pervious and non-pervious) installed in or around a landscaped area, such as pavements or walls. Pools and other water features are considered part of the landscaped area and not considered hardscapes for purposes of this Section. 
Irrigation efficiency means the measurement of the amount of water beneficially used divided by the amount of water applied. Irrigation efficiency is derived from measurements and estimates of irrigation system characteristics and management practices. The irrigation efficiency for purposes of this Section are 0.75 for overhead spray devices and 0.81 for drip systems. 
Landscaped area means all the planting areas, turf areas, and water features in a landscape design plan subject to the maximum applied water allowance and estimated applied water use calculations. The landscaped area does not include footprints of buildings or structures, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, decks, patios, gravel or stone walks, other pervious or non-pervious hardscapes, and other non-irrigated areas designated for non-development (e.g., open spaces and existing native vegetation). 
Landscape contractor means a person licensed by the State of California to construct, maintain, repair, install, or subcontract the development of landscape systems. 
Landscape documentation package means the documents required to be provided to the City for review and approval of landscape design projects, as described in the Guidelines. 
Landscape project means total area of landscape in a project, as provided in the definition of "landscaped area," meeting the requirements under Subsection (b). 
Local agency means a local water purveyor or city or county, including a charter city or charter county, that is authorized to implement, administer, and/or enforce any of the provisions of this Section. The local agency may be responsible for the enforcement or delegation of enforcement of this Section, including, but not limited to, design review, plan check, issuance of permits, and inspection of a landscape project. 
Local water purveyor means any entity, including a public agency, city, county, or private water company that provides retail water service. 
Maximum applied water allowance or MAWA means the upper limit of annual applied water for the established landscaped area as specified in the Guidelines. It is based upon the area's reference evapotranspiration, the ET adjustment factor, and the size of the landscaped area. The estimated applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance. MAWA = (ETo)(0.62)[(ETAF x LA) + ((1-ETAF) x SLA)] 
Mined-land reclamation projects means any surface mining operation with a reclamation plan approved in accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. 
New construction means, for the purposes of this Section, a new building with a landscape or other new landscape such as a park, playground, or greenbelt without an associated building. 
Non-pervious means any surface or natural material that does not allow for the passage of water through the material and into the underlying soil. 
Pervious means any surface or material that allows the passage of water through the material and into the underlying soil. 
Permit means an authorizing document issued by local agencies for new construction or rehabilitated landscape. 
Plant factor or plant water use factor is a factor, when multiplied by ETo, that estimates the amount of water needed by plants. For purposes of this Section, the plant factor range for very low water use plants is 0 to 0.1; the plant factor range for low water use plants is 0.1 to 0.3; the plant factor range for moderate water use plants is 0.4 to 0.6; and the plant factor range for high water use plants is 0.7 to 1.0. Plant factors cited in this Section are derived from the publication "Water Use Classification of Landscape Species." Plant factors may also be obtained from horticultural researchers from academic institutions or professional associations as approved by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). 
Recycled water or reclaimed water means treated or recycled waste water of a quality suitable for non-potable uses such as landscape irrigation and water features. This water is not intended for human consumption. 
Reference evapotranspiration or ETo means a standard measurement of environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants. ETo is given expressed in inches per day, month, or year as represented in the Guidelines, and is an estimate of the evapotranspiration of a large field of four- to seven-inch tall, cool-season grass that is well watered. Reference evapotranspiration is used as the basis of determining the maximum applied water allowances. 
Rehabilitated landscape means any re-landscaping project that meets the applicability criteria of Subsection (b)(1), where the modified landscape area is greater than 2,500 square feet. 
Smart automatic irrigation controller means an automatic timing device used to remotely control valves that operate an irrigation system and which schedules irrigation events using either evapotranspiration (weather-based) or soil moisture data. 
Special landscape area means an area of the landscape dedicated solely to edible plants such as orchards and vegetable gardens, areas irrigated with recycled water, water features using recycled water, and recreational areas dedicated to active play such as parks, sports fields, golf courses, and where turf provides a playing surface. 
Turf means a ground cover surface of mowed grass. Annual bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass, Red fescue, and Tall fescue are cool-season grasses. Bermuda grass, Kikuyu grass, Seashore Paspalum, St. Augustinge grass, Zoysia grass, and Buffalo grass are warm-season grasses. 
Valve means a device used to control the flow of water in an irrigation system. 
Water feature means a design element where open water performs an aesthetic or recreational function. Water features include ponds, lakes, waterfalls, fountains, artificial streams, spas, and swimming pools (where water is artificially supplied). The surface area of water features is included in the high water use hydrozone of the landscaped area. Constructed wetlands used for on-site wastewater treatment, habitat protection or storm water best management practices that are not irrigated and used solely for water treatment or storm water retention are not water features and, therefore, are not subject to the water budget calculation.

Parking facilities may be provided jointly subject to the satisfaction of the requirements of this Section and approval of a site development permit pursuant to Section 9.08.170, and, when an inadequate supply of required parking is provided on site, an alternative development standard pursuant to Section 9.08.050. The joint use/shared parking plan shall include: 
(1)  Written verification from the involved property owners and tenants acknowledging acceptance of and compliance with the requirements of the joint use/shared parking plan; 
(2)  A proposed means of providing notice of the joint use/shared parking plan to all future property owners, tenants and other users; 
(3)  A proposed means to amend the agreement to include future users/tenants or changes based upon participant modifications to uses; 
(4)  A site plan showing all parking spaces, building square footage and tenant spaces within the complex or area participating; 
(5)  A joint use/shared parking matrix with the following information: 
a.  The number of parking stalls available on-site (parking supply); 
b.  Project building and tenant addresses; 
c.  Gross square footage of all buildings and tenant spaces; 
d.  The name, type of use and the days and hours of operation for each tenant; 
e.  The number of parking stalls required for each tenant based on each tenant's gross square footage and type of use; 
f.  The hourly parking demand for all tenants on: 
1.  Weekdays (Monday through Friday); 
2.  Saturdays; and 
3.  Sundays. 
g.  A comparison between hourly parking demand and the parking supply to show that demand will not exceed parking supply. 
(b)  Joint usage where there is an overall deficiency in the number of spaces provided. Parking facilities for adjoining uses within shopping centers for which the hours of parking demand are substantially different from each other may be provided jointly. Such joint usage shall be subject to: 
(1)  The granting of an alternative development standard by the City; and 
(2)  The satisfaction of the following conditions: 
a.  Absence of conflicts. Sufficient evidence as identified and documented in a parking study shall be submitted demonstrating that no substantial conflict in the principal hours or periods of peak demands of the structures or uses for which the joint use is proposed will exist. 
b.  Allocation of spaces. The number of parking spaces which may be allocated to the requirements for each structure or use involved shall not exceed the number of spaces reasonably anticipated to be available during the differing hours of operation. 
c.  Location. The parking facilities designated for joint use shall be contiguous to all the structures and uses served and not more than 200 feet from each shared use. A pedestrian pathway is required to provide a means for pedestrian linkage between immediately adjacent land uses and uses within the parking facility. 
d.  Deed recorded agreements. The city may require a written agreement, approved by the City Attorney as to form and content, to be executed by all parties concerned and filed in the office of the County Recorder. Such agreement shall be a covenant running with the land or other enforceable restriction and shall assure the continued availability of the number of spaces designated for joint use at the periods of time indicated. 
(c)  Joint usage where there is no overall deficiency in the number of spaces provided. If two or more adjoining uses are under common ownership, or if the ownership is not common and the respective owners thereof have acquired recordable easements appurtenant for off-street parking approved by the City Attorney as to form and content, such buildings or uses collectively may provide the required off-street parking, in which case the required number of parking spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual uses computed separately. 
(d)  Mixed land use developments (shared parking). Shared parking may be considered in determining the specific number of parking spaces that can be used to serve two or more individual land uses without conflict or encroachment. Any program that would use a shared parking concept may be granted by the Planning Commission through the alternative development standards process if it determines in any individual use that the following findings can be satisfied: 
(1)  Variations in the peak accumulations of parking vehicles as the result of different activity patterns of mixed land use will not result in a deficiency of parking spaces (by hour, by day, by season). 
(2)  There is a relationship among the land uses that result in two or more land use activities with a single vehicle trip to the development. 
In preparing a traffic/parking study for consideration by the Planning Commission, a methodology acceptable to the Development Services Director and City Engineer is to be used.

Sec. 9.07.010. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this Section is to establish guidelines and standards for the regulation of signs, sign structures and sign programs, so as to assure adequate identification of businesses and other activities, as well as to maintain and improve the quality of the visual environment within the City. The procedures and regulations of this Section are enacted to: 
(1)  Encourage the effective use of signs and graphics as a means of identification and communication in the community; 
(2)  Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the ability of the City to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
(3)  Permit such signs that will not, by reason of their size, location, construction, or manner of display, endanger the public safety of individuals, confuse, mislead, or distract the vision necessary for traffic safety, or otherwise endanger public health, safety and morals; 
(4)  Provide procedures and standards to control the location, size, type, number, and all other matters pertaining to signs within the City; and 
(5)  Provide consistency among signs within an integrated commercial center. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007)  
Sec. 9.07.020. - Applicability. 
(a)  Signs shall only be erected or maintained in compliance with this Section. The number and area of signs as outlined in this Section are intended to be maximum standards which do not necessarily ensure architectural compatibility. Therefore, the review and approval of sign permits and sign programs in compliance with this Section shall consider a sign's relationship to the overall appearance of the site and the surrounding community, in addition to the standards of this Section. 
(b)  These sign regulations are not intended to restrict, limit or control the content or message of signs. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007)

(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007)  
Sec. 9.07.040. - Sign program. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the sign program is to: 
(1)  Assure coordination and compatibility between all signs within an integrated center, including, but not limited to retail centers and business parks. 
(2)  Prevent visual clutter caused by signs excessive in size and number. 
(3)  Ensure that signs are compatible with the desired image of the zoning district in which they are located. 
(4)  Encourage uniqueness and individuality in signage within the established criteria. 
(b)  Applicability. A sign program is a coordinated program of signs which is required for all integrated centers; including individual buildings with multiple tenants, building complexes, commercial centers or business parks. For all integrated centers, no permit shall be issued for an individual sign unless and until a sign program for the site on which the sign will be erected has been submitted and approved by the Planning Commission in conformance with this Section and Section 9.08.160. 
(c)  Sign program requirements. A sign program shall consist of the following: 
(1)  A copy of an approved site plan showing location of buildings, building elevations, parking areas, driveways, landscaped areas, and adjacent streets. 
(2)  An accurate indication on the site plan and building elevations of the location of all existing and proposed signs requiring a permit. 
(3)  Computation of the total number of signs, sign area for individual signs, total sign area and dimensions of signs for each existing and proposed sign type. 
(4)  For each existing or proposed sign, the following shall be specified:

(5)  The sign program may contain such other restrictions as the owners of the property within the sign program area may reasonably request to be adopted by the City. 
(d)  Consent. The sign program application shall be signed by all property owners or their authorized representatives. 
(e)  Existing signs and sign programs. 
(1)  Unless completed sooner, each sign program in the City shall be replaced with a sign program that is consistent with the sign regulations and standards of this Title within five years of the approval of this Title. 
(2)  When any new or amended sign program is submitted for a property on which existing signs are located, all such existing signs not in compliance with the proposed sign program shall be considered nonconforming and subject to the provisions of Section 9.07.130. 
(f)  Binding effect. After approval of a sign program, no sign requiring a permit shall be erected, constructed, installed, displayed, altered, placed or maintained except in accordance with such program. The sign program may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this Title. In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a program and any other provision of this Section, the sign program provisions shall prevail.

(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007)  
Sec. 9.07.090. - Permitted signs by zoning district. 
This Section specifies the criteria for: 
(1)  Signs permitted in residential zoning districts; 
(2)  Signs permitted in commercial and business park zoning districts; and 
(3)  Signs permitted in all other zoning districts. 
Signs shall be permitted in the City in accordance with the standards contained in Tables 9.07.1 through 9.07.6. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007)  
Sec. 9.07.100. - Measurement of sign area and height. 
The following regulations shall control the measurement of sign area and sign height: 
(1)  Height of a sign. The height of a sign shall be computed by measuring the vertical distance from the midpoint, or average ground level, along the base of the sign structure, excluding any berming, to the highest point of the structure as illustrated in Figure 9.07.1. Sign height for monument signs shall be measured from ground level, even when the sign structure itself is not located at ground level. 
(2)  Measurement of sign area for signs with no distinct border or boundary. Sign area shall be calculated by computing the area consisting of not more than eight continuous, perpendicular straight lines, which contains all of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display on such sign as illustrated in Figure 9.07.2. 
(3)  Measurement of sign area for signs with a distinct border or boundary. For signs with a distinct border or boundary, the sign area shall be computed by measuring the entire area enclosing the sign copy, emblem or character as described in Subsection (2). Background or borders containing no copy, emblems, or characters shall also be included in the calculation of sign area. The combined area of sign copy and sign background/border shall be no more than two times the area of the sign copy as illustrated in Figure 9.07.3. 
(4)  Double-sided sign. The sign area of signs which have two identical faces, arranged back to back in parallel planes, shall be computed for one side only, provided that the two sign faces are no more than 18 inches apart. 
(5)  Multiple-sided sign. Signs which have more than one side and are not double-sided signs have a sign area as computed for all sides, cumulatively. 
(6)  Including sign structure or support. Where a sign base, structure, support or other feature such as berms is designed in such a manner to make the sign more noticeable or appear larger (such as backlighting of an entire awning), as determined by the Development Services Director or Planning Commission, the area of the structure or support shall be included in the sign height and sign area, as applicable. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007; Ord. No. 07-07, § 2, 11-14-2007)

Sec. 9.07.110. - Sign design, construction, and maintenance. 
All signs shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  All signs shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Uniform Building Code and the electrical code of the City at all times. 
(2)  Unless otherwise specified by a sign program, all permanent wall signage shall consist of individual channel letters.

Sec. 9.07.120. - Abatement of illegal and abandoned signs. 
The following provisions shall control the regulation of abandoned signs: 
(1)  Any illegal or abandoned sign, either temporary or permanent, shall be removed by the property owner within ten days after notice from the Development Services Director. Any sign not removed within ten days after such notice, may be summarily abated by the Code Enforcement Officer if no appeal has been made of the Development Services Director's decision pursuant to this Title. Said signs shall be retained by the City for a period of not less than three working days. Thereafter, any unclaimed signs may be discarded. 
(2)  The reasonable cost of such removal shall be assessed against the sign owner. The cost of removal shall be determined by resolution of the City Council. 
(3)  Legal, conforming structural supports for abandoned signs may remain, if installed with a blank sign face and supporting structures are maintained. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007; Ord. No. 07-07, § 2, 11-14-2007)  
Sec. 9.07.130. - Legal nonconforming signs. 
(a)  A legal nonconforming sign is any permanent sign that was legally established and maintained in conformance with the provisions of all applicable laws in effect at the time of original installation but that does not comply with the provisions of this Section. 
(b)  A nonconforming sign shall not be: 
(1)  Changed to another nonconforming sign or replaced by the same or similar nonconforming sign. 
(2)  Structurally or electrically expanded or altered unless such alteration is designed to and does bring the sign into full compliance with all current provisions of this Section. 
(3)  Relocated to another site on the same property or another property in the City. 
(4)  Reestablished after discontinuation of use for 90 days in a one-year period. 
(5)  Reestablished after damage or destruction of more than 50 percent of the value or structure/mass of the sign prior to said damage or destruction.

Editor's note Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), adopted April 11, 2007, enacted provisions intended for use as Subsections (1) and (2). To preserve the style of this Code, and at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as Subsections (a) and (b).  
Chapter 9.08 - Administration 
 
Sec. 9.08.010. - Consistency with the General Plan. 
(a)  Consistency requirements. The State Government Code requires that all City zoning codes, zone changes, subdivisions, and public works projects be consistent with the City's General Plan. No public or private development project shall be approved which is inconsistent with the City's General Plan. This Section sets forth procedures for determining the consistency of proposed projects with the General Plan. 
(b)  Procedures for determining consistency. 
(1)  The Development Services Director shall make a preliminary finding whether a proposed zone change, subdivision, or other land use or development application is consistent with the General Plan. This finding shall be considered by the applicable decision-making authority when the proposal is scheduled for normal development application processing for approval or denial. The appropriate decision-making authority shall make a final determination of General Plan consistency prior to or concurrent with approval or denial of the application in question. 
(2)  In all cases, if the final decision-making authority finds that a proposal is not consistent with the General Plan, the proposal shall be denied. 
(3)  Determinations regarding General Plan consistency may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.08.100. 
(c)  Criteria for determining consistency. The Development Services Director or the applicable decision-making authority shall utilize the following criteria in determining whether a proposed project is consistent with the General Plan: 
(1)  The proposal is compatible with the goals, policies, programs, and land uses of applicable elements of the General Plan. In order to satisfy this criterion, a proposal must meet the overall intent of such goals and policies. 
(2)  The base zoning district required to accommodate the proposal is consistent with the applicable General Plan land use designation shown on the General Plan land use policy map. Such zoning consistency shall be determined by consulting the zoning consistency matrix (Table 9.03.1) which depicts which zoning districts are consistent with the various General Plan designations. 
(3)  For residential projects, the number of project dwelling units is consistent with the density allowed by the General Plan land use designation. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007; Ord. No. 07-07, § 2, 11-14-2007)  
Sec. 9.08.020. - Maximum density and floor area ratio (FAR). 
The maximum residential density for a specific property is designated on the General Plan Land Use Policy Map. The actual density, net dwelling units and floor area ratio (FAR) may be less than the maximum designated on the General Plan in order to meet the development standards of Chapter 9.03 and other applicable regulations. The City Council has the final authority, through the administration of this Title, to determine the appropriate density and FAR for each site. 
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007)  
Sec. 9.08.030. - General procedures. 
All development proposals may be subject to one or more development application processing procedures contained in this Chapter. The exact application processing procedures that apply to a specific project will be determined by the Development Services Director based on the project characteristics. Table 9.08.1 outlines the primary types of development applications and review procedures.

(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007; Ord. No. 07-07, § 2, 11-14-2007; Ord. No. 09-03, § 10, 3-25-2009; Ord. No. 16-03, § 5, 4-13-2016)  
Sec. 9.08.050. - Alternative development standards. 
(a)  Purpose. The development standards of this Title may be modified by the Planning Commission to permit development on property that is constrained due to lot size, shape, location, access restrictions, or other constraints. alternative development standards are intended to be used only when deviations from the standards in this Code are truly minor and no potential negative impact associated with the health, safety, and welfare of adjacent persons or properties will occur. 
(b)  Applicability. Once an alternative development standard has been approved for a project, another alternative development standard of the same type (e.g., parking requirements, height, setbacks) may not be granted. More specifically, if one alternative development standard is granted for a certain standard, any future change to that same standard that is not in conformance with the requirements of this Zoning Code shall require a variance. 
Additionally, after the first certificate of use and occupancy of an individual residential dwelling unit has been issued, the site development standards contained within this Title shall apply to that dwelling unit and shall only be modified subject to the variance procedure contained in Section 9.08.210. No alternative development standard may be granted for any residential dwelling unit after the first certificate of use and occupancy has been issued. 
(c)  Decision-making authority. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application for an alternative development standard pursuant to the following limitations: 
(1)  Reduction by not more than ten percent of the required lot area, minimum floor area, and setback standard identified in the Code. Where ten percent is less than one foot, up to a one foot variation from the original standard may be allowed. 
Notwithstanding, nothing in this provision prevents the Development Services Director from having the discretion to approve minor deviations of up to 20 percent encroachment within the rear setback area of residential developments. 
(2)  Increases in the height of both retaining and non-retaining side or rear yard fences, walls, or hedges by not more than one foot over the maximum permitted height. No alternative development standard may be granted for any fence, wall, or hedge that is located in the required front yard setback. 
(3)  Increases in non-residential building height for architectural features by not more than ten feet in excess of the permitted building height. 
(4)  Variations from landscaping and screening requirements if the project design or improvement is in substantial compliance with the intent of Sections 9.05.070 and 9.08.140. 
(5)  Variations from sign standards and regulations if the sign is in substantial compliance with the intent of Chapter 9.07. 
(6)  Variations from the parking standards and regulations by not more than ten percent of the standard outlined in the Chapter 9.06. 
(d)  Alternative development standard process. Figure 9.08.1 illustrates the process described below: 
(1)  An application shall be filed with the Development Services Director. 
(2)  The Development Services Director shall review the application and shall determine whether the application is complete and whether the proposal qualifies as an alternative development standard within 30 days of the application date. If the application does not qualify as an alternative development standard request, the Development Services Director shall notify the applicant, and the application is considered withdrawn. 
(3)  If the application qualifies as an alternative development standard request and is deemed complete, the Development Services Department and other relevant City departments shall evaluate the request, and a public hearing with the Planning Commission shall be held pursuant to the public hearing procedures established in Section 9.08.150. 
(4)  Written notice of the alternative development standard request shall be provided to owners of adjacent and abutting properties at least ten days prior to the public hearing as contained in Section 9.08.150. 
(5)  Appeal of the Planning Commission's decision may be made pursuant to Section 9.08.100. 
(e)  Findings required. Approval of an alternative development standard shall require the following findings by the Planning Commission: 
(1)  That the proposed alternative development standard will better serve the public interest by the establishment of the proposed alternative development standard; 
(2)  That the proposed alternative development standard will be consistent with the objectives, policies and general land uses and programs specified in the City's General Plan; 
(3)  That the proposed alternative development standard is consistent with other provisions of this Title; 
(4)  That the location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed alternative development standard will not create unusual noise, traffic or other conditions or situations that may be objectionable, detrimental, or incompatible with other permitted uses in the vicinity; and 
(5)  That the proposed alternative development standard will not result in conditions or circumstances contrary to the public health and safety and the general welfare. 
(f)  Consistency of working drawings with approved plans. Alternative development standard approval shall pertain only to those plans reviewed and approved with the alternative development standard. Further, all plans approved with an alternative development standard shall be considered an integral part of the alternative development standard approval. The Development Services Director shall ensure that any final working drawings for grading or construction authorized by an alternative development standard approval are consistent with said previously-reviewed plans prior to release of working drawings for plan check. The Development Services Director may approve minor variations from previously-reviewed plans if he/she determines that the original plan concepts are being carried out. If the Development Services Director does not make such a determination, the subject working drawings shall be referred to the decision-making authority for review and action.

Sec. 9.08.090. - Annexation and pre-zoning. 
(a)  Procedure. 
(1)  Prior to City Council adoption of a Resolution of intention to annex uninhabited territory or a Resolution of consent to commence annexation of inhabited territory proceedings, the City Council shall request a report from the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall consider the desirability of annexing the territory and the zoning (prezoning prior to annexation) to be placed thereon in the event of annexation to the City. Upon completion of such consideration, the Planning Commission shall, after holding a public hearing, make its report and recommendation to the City Council (Figure 9.08.5). 
(2)  Upon receipt of the Planning Commission report, the City Council may accept in whole or in part or reject, modify or amend any recommendation as to pre-zoning classification and the Resolution of Intention or Resolution of Consent shall specify the proposed pre-zoning classification for the territory as the City Council determines.

When pre-zoning maps of properties outside the incorporated area have been adopted by Ordinance, any such territory, upon becoming a part of the City, shall possess the classification indicated on the detailed pre-zoning map. Such pre-zoning maps shall then become a part of the official zoning map of the City, and the subject properties shall thereafter be subject to all the provisions of this Title. 
(2)  Decision-making authority. The City Council may amend the official zoning map to pre-zone certain contiguous areas outside the City which, in the opinion of the City Council bear relationship to the General Plan and sphere of influence, prior to annexation by adoption of an amending Ordinance in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section. 
(3)  Initiation of application. Consideration of pre-zoning certain contiguous areas outside the City prior to annexation, may be initiated for a given parcel by the City Council or by the record owner of that parcel or the owner's authorized agent. 
Applications for pre-zoning may be filed with the Development Services Director. The Development Services Director shall prescribe the form of application and the supporting information required to initiate both environmental review (pursuant to Section 9.08.220) and the pre-zoning application review. Once an application is received by the Development Services Director, the application will be reviewed for completeness.

(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007; Ord. No. 07-07, § 2, 11-14-2007)  
Sec. 9.08.110. - Conditional use permit. 
(a)  Introduction. Chapter 9.03 contains listings of land uses that are permitted within the different zoning districts upon approval of a conditional use permit. Such uses require approval of a conditional use permit for their establishment because, although deemed consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning district, they typically have characteristics that require special regulation in order to avoid or minimize potential adverse impacts on surrounding properties. 
(b)  Listings of conditional uses. Only those uses listed in the zoning district regulations of Chapter 9.03 as conditional uses or those uses added to such listing as described in Section 9.03.050 may be approved within a given zoning district by means of a conditional use permit. 
(c)  Decision-making authority. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve, deny, or approve with conditions those applications for a conditional use permit as specified in Subsection 9.01.030(e). 
(d)  Initiation of application. Applications for conditional use permits may be filed with the Development Services Department by a recorded owner of the property in question or by the owner's authorized agent. The Development Services Director shall prescribe the form of application and the supporting information required to initiate both environmental review (pursuant to Section 9.08.220) and the conditional use permit application review. 
(e)  Conditional use permit process. Conditional use permit applications shall be processed in accordance with the procedure depicted in Figure 9.08.7. Once an application is received by the Development Services Director, the application will be reviewed for completeness. If the Development Services Director finds the application to be complete, then the application shall be processed in accordance with the process illustrated in Figure 9.08.7. If the application is found to be incomplete, the Development Services Director will notify the applicant in writing within 30 days what additional information is required, and the application will not be processed until that information is received by the Development Services Department. 
(f)  Findings and conditions of approval. 
(1)  The following findings must be made prior to approval of a conditional use permit: 
a.  That the use proposed conditional use permit will be consistent with the objectives, policies and general land uses and programs specified in the City's General Plan; 
b.  That the proposed conditional use permit is consistent with the provisions of this Title; 
c.  That the location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed conditional use permit will not create unusual noise, traffic or other conditions or situations that may be objectionable, detrimental, or incompatible with other permitted uses in the vicinity; and 
d.  That the proposed conditional use permit will not result in conditions or circumstances contrary to the public health and safety and the general welfare. 
(2)  In order to mitigate the possible adverse impact of a proposed project on surrounding properties and to ensure overall consistency of the use with the Zoning Code and the General Plan, specific conditions may be imposed on any conditional use permit approval. 
(g)  Establishment of use. Conditional use permits, when approved, authorize the establishment and operation of a particular land use at a particular location. The project must be established at the approved location within one year of the final approval of the conditional use permit unless extended by the Planning Commission or City Council for up to one additional year. Additional conditions may be imposed on a conditional use permit in conjunction with a time extension. Such establishment shall consist of the satisfaction of all relevant conditional use permit conditions of approval and one of the following three actions: 
(1)  The issuance of a building permit for new construction (if said permit expires, approval of conditional use permit shall become null and void); 
(2)  The issuance of a certificate of use and occupancy for the establishment of a comparable project in an existing structure; or 
(3)  The commencement of operation of the comparable project in cases where no construction or existing structure is involved. 
If the preceding requirements are not met within one year of final conditional use permit approval unless otherwise extended by the Planning Commission or City Council, the conditional use permit shall be null and void. 
(h)  Consistency of working drawings with approved plans. A conditional use permit approval shall pertain only to those plans reviewed and approved with the conditional use permit. Further, all plans approved with a conditional use permit shall be considered an integral part of the conditional use permit approval. The Development Services Director shall ensure that any final working drawings for grading or construction authorized by a conditional use permit approval are consistent with said previously-reviewed plans prior to release of working drawings for plan check. The Development Services Director may approve minor variations from previously-reviewed plans if he/she determines that the original plan concepts are being carried out. If the Development Services Director does not make such a determination, the subject working drawings shall be referred to the decision-making authority for review and action. 
The Planning Commission may extend the time period for meeting the preceding requirements for establishment of the use up to one additional year. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing prior to action on such a time extension. 
Additional conditions may be imposed on a conditional use permit in conjunction with a time extension. However, such new conditions may only be imposed following a public hearing to receive testimony on the proposed additional conditions. 
(i)  Discontinuance of conditional use. Whenever any use of land, building or premises established under a conditional use permit is discontinued for a cumulative period of 90 days within a one-year period, it shall be unlawful to reestablish such use unless a new conditional use permit is approved in accordance with the provisions of this Section. 
(j)  Appeals. Decisions on conditional use permit applications may be appealed to the City Council by the applicant or other interested party in accordance with Section 9.08.100. 
(k)  Revocation. A conditional use permit may be revoked or modified (including the imposition of additional conditions) by the approving body upon finding by said authority that the conditions of approval of the conditional use permit have not been met or that the land use is being operated in violation of other provisions of this Title. A public hearing shall be held in accordance with Section 9.08.150 prior to action on revocation or modification. The Development Services Director may schedule such a hearing upon his or her preliminary finding of noncompliance with any of the preceding requirements.

Once an application is received by the Development Services Director, the application will be reviewed for completeness. If the Development Services Director finds the application to be complete, then the application shall be processed in accordance with the process illustrated in Figure 9.08.10. If the application is found to be incomplete, the Development Services Director will notify the applicant in writing within 30 days what additional information is required, and the application will not be processed until that information is received by the Development Services Department. 
(2)  When a site development permit is required in the absence of any other discretionary permit, the Development Services Director or the Planning Commission shall, review and take action upon the application in accordance with the following procedures: 
a.  Decision by the Development Services Director. When an application for a site development permit proposes a building addition that would increase by 10 percent or less the gross square feet of non-residential building area approved on the original site development permit, up to a maximum of 6,500 square feet, or which involves temporary uses and structures, the Development Services Director shall have the authority to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the project. All decisions of the Development Services Director are subject to appeal to the Planning Commission, pursuant to Section 9.08.100. The Development Services Director may refer any application for a site development permit to the Planning Commission for consideration. 
b.  Decision by the Planning Commission. When an application for a site development permit proposes a building addition that would increase by more than ten percent of the gross square feet approved on the original site development permit of non-residential building area, or any increase above 6,500 square feet, or any new residential development, the application must be reviewed by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the project. Decisions of the Planning Commission are subject to appeal to the City Council, pursuant to Section 9.08.100. No public hearing is required. 
c.  If a site development permit proposes a development standard different than those identified by this Title for the proposed use or zoning district, such site development permit shall always require a public hearing before the Planning Commission and findings be made pursuant to Section 9.08.050 (Alternative Development Standards). 
d.  If an application for a site development permit proposes a use not specifically identified as permitted by this Title, such site development permit shall be considered by the Planning Commission as described in Section 9.03.050 (Use Determination). 
e.  If a site development permit is processed in conjunction with a conditional use permit, alternative development standard, variance, or other discretionary permit, additional findings may be required. 
(3)  If a site development permit application is submitted in conjunction with another discretionary permit, the Development Services Director shall conduct the review and shall make a recommendation to the Planning Commission. 
(e)  Findings and conditions of approval. 
(1)  The following findings must be made prior to approval of a site development permit: 
a.  In acting to approve a site development permit, the Development Services Director or Planning Commission shall be required to make the following findings: 
b.  That the proposed site development permit will be consistent with the objectives, policies and general land uses and programs specified in the City's General Plan; 
c.  That the proposed site development permit is consistent with the provisions of this Title; 
d.  That the location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed site development permit will not create unusual noise, traffic or other conditions or situations that may be objectionable, detrimental, or incompatible with other permitted uses in the vicinity; and 
e.  That the proposed site development permit will not result in conditions or circumstances contrary to the public health and safety and the general welfare. 
(2)  In order to mitigate the possible adverse impact of a proposed project on surrounding properties and to ensure overall consistency of the development project with the Zoning Code and the General Plan, specific conditions may be imposed on any site development permit approval. 
(f)  Establishment of development. Site development permits, when approved, authorize new construction, reconstruction, building additions, or structural or site modifications at a particular location. Projects approved by site development permits must be established at the approved location within the time frame set by the approval authority. Time extensions to establish development may be granted by the Planning Commission. Site development permits shall expire and become null and void if any of the following activities do not occur within the timeframes established by the permit: 
(1)  The issuance of a building permit for new construction (if said building permit expires, approval of site development permit shall become null and void); 
(2)  The issuance of a certificate of use and occupancy for the establishment of the approved development; or 
(3)  The commencement of operation of the use in cases where no construction or existing structure is involved. 
(g)  Consistency of working drawings with approved plans. A site development permit approval shall pertain only to those plans reviewed and approved with the site development permit. Further, all plans approved with a site development permit shall be considered an integral part of the site development permit approval. The Development Services Director shall ensure that any final working drawings for grading or construction authorized by a site development permit approval are consistent with said previously-reviewed plans prior to release of working drawings for plan check. The Development Services Director may approve minor variations from previously-reviewed plans if he/she determines that the original plan concepts are being carried out. If the Development Services Director does not make such a determination, the subject working drawings shall be referred to the decision-making authority for review and action. 
The Planning Commission may extend the time period for meeting the preceding requirements for establishment of development. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing prior to action on such a time extension. Additional conditions may be imposed on a site development permit in conjunction with a time extension. However, such new conditions may only be imposed following a public hearing to receive testimony on the proposed additional conditions.

Sec. 9.08.190. - Specific plan. 
(a)  Introduction. The specific plan provides a means to establish more specific land use regulations and design standards for properties requiring special attention and treatment (see Government Code §§ 6545065457). A specific plan serves as a policy and regulatory document, with policy direction and project development concepts consistent with the General Plan. 
(b)  Specific plan initiation. The City Council shall identify those portions of the City where a specific plan is appropriate to meet the purposes of this specific plan designation. At the discretion of the City Council, specific plans may be prepared by the City or by persons representing affected property owners (Figure 9.08.11). 
(c)  Specific plan requirements. 
(1)  Relationship to other adopted regulations. Specific plans may either supplement or supersede all land use regulations applicable to the subject property, including all previously adopted ordinances, standards, and guidelines. In the event an inconsistency or conflict exists between standards adopted within a specific plan and comparable provisions of this Title, adopted infrastructure master plans, or development standards, the standards and regulations made part of the specific plan shall prevail. 
(2)  Scope of a specific plan. Each specific plan shall identify specific land uses, standards, and criteria necessary for the development, maintenance, and use of the subject property in compliance with the policies and programs of the General Plan. Each specific plan shall clearly specify how and to what extent the plan is to improve upon, supplement, or supersede any adopted ordinance, regulations, and standards. Where not otherwise specifically referenced and addressed by a specific plan, all adopted ordinances, regulations, standards, and guidelines of the City shall apply. 
(3)  Content.

5.  The location of and types of streets. 
6.  Public facilities and infrastructure required to serve developments within the plan area. 
7.  Landscaping and parking lot treatments. 
8.  Proposed conservation, open space and/or recreation areas, if any. 
9.  Any other programs, guidelines or standards appropriate for the area covered by the plan. 
(4)  If the land use regulations of the specific plan allow a site development permit or specific plan to authorize a development standard different than those identified by this Title for the proposed use or zoning district, such site development permit or specific plan shall always require a public hearing before the Planning Commission and findings be made pursuant to Section 9.08.050. 
(d)  Proceedings. Except as provided below, specific plan applications shall be processed in accordance with the standard processing provisions of this Chapter (Figure 9.08.11): 
(1)  Planning Commission recommendation. The Planning Commission recommendation to City Council on all specific plan applications shall be in the form of an adopted Resolution recommending approval, approval with modifications, or denial of the application.

(3)  Modifications. If the City Council proposes any substantial modification to the specific plan not previously considered by the Planning Commission, the City Council shall refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for consideration. Failure of the Planning Commission to act within 45 days of receiving the City Council's request shall provide the City Council with the authority to act without the recommendation. 
(e)  Findings required. The City Council shall be required to make the following findings in acting to approve a specific plan and any amendment thereto: 
(1)  The proposed specific plan is consistent with and provides for the orderly, systematic, and specific implementation of the General Plan. 
(2)  The land use and development regulations within the specific plan are comparable in breadth and depth to similar zoning regulations contained in this title. 
(f)  Specific plan amendment. Any specific plan may be amended by the same procedure as the specific plan (or portion thereof) is adopted. The City may initiate amendments to any portion of a specific plan. The following changes to a specific plan shall require a specific plan amendment:

(a)  Introduction. This Section provides for the consideration of variances and exceptions to the regulations of this Title. 
(b)  Variance to regulations. 
(1)  Variances may be approved only when the City determines that, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of this Title deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity under identical zoning classification. 
(2)  Any variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized will not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone in which such property is situated. 
(3)  A variance shall not be granted to authorize a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized in the zoning district (Chapter 9.03) governing the parcel. 
(c)  Decision-making authority. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve, deny, or approve with conditions the variance application as shown in Figure 9.08.12. Application for a variance shall be filed with the Development Services Department. The Development Services Director shall prescribe the form of application and the supporting information required to initiate the variance application review. If the application is found to be incomplete, the Development Services Department will notify the applicant in writing within 30 days what additional information is required, and the application will not be processed until that information is received by the Development Services Department. 
(d)  Findings required. No variance shall be approved unless the decision-making authority makes all of the following findings: 
(1)  That there are special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings such that the strict application of this Title would deprive such property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical zoning classification. Economic hardship is not an appropriate special circumstance for making this finding. 
(2)  That the granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which such property is situated. 
(3)  That the variance will not result in development which is otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this Title. 
(4)  That the variance will not result in development which is inconsistent with the goals, policies and objectives of the General Plan. 
(5)  That the variance will be consistent with the objectives, policies and general land uses and programs specified in the City's General Plan; 
(6)  That the variance is consistent with the provisions of this Title; 
(7)  That the variance will not create unusual noise, traffic or other conditions or situations that may be objectionable, detrimental, or incompatible with other permitted uses in the vicinity; and 
(8)  That the variance will not result in conditions or circumstances contrary to the public health and safety and the general welfare. 
(e)  Appeals. Decisions on variance applications may be appealed by the applicant or other interested party to the City Council in accordance with Section 9.08.100. 
(f)  Expiration of variance. If construction (or other entitlement) authorized by an approved variance has not been commenced within one year of variance approval, the variance shall be null and void. 
(g)  Consistency of working drawings with approved plans. A variance approval shall pertain only to those plans reviewed and approved with the variance. Further, all plans approved with a variance shall be considered an integral part of the variance approval. The Development Services Director shall ensure that any final working drawings for grading or construction authorized by a variance approval are consistent with said previously-reviewed plans prior to release of working drawings for plan check. The Development Services Director may approve minor variations from previously-reviewed plans if he/she determines that the original plan concepts are being carried out. If the Development Services Director does not make such a determination, the subject working drawings shall be referred to the decision-making authority for review and action. 
(h)  Revocation. A variance may be revoked or modified, including the imposition of additional conditions, by the approving body upon a finding that the conditions of approval of the variance have not been met or that the land use is being operated in violation of other provisions of this Title. A public hearing shall be held in accordance with Section 9.08.150 prior to action on revocation or modification. The Development Services Director may schedule such a hearing upon his/her preliminary finding of noncompliance with any of the preceding requirements.

In the event it is determined that the proposed waste discharge would result in or add to such a violation, the Planning Commission shall disapprove the tentative map unless there are extenuating or overriding considerations, in which case these shall be stated. 
(2)  In the event a subdivision fronting upon a public waterway, river or stream or upon a lake or reservoir owned in part or entirely by a public agency does not provide public access to such public resources through the subdivision itself in accordance with the requirements of Subsections 9.10.060(u) and (v), the Planning Commission shall find that reasonable public access to the resource in question is otherwise available within a reasonable distance from the subdivision. If this finding cannot be made, the map shall be disapproved.

(2)  A portion of a tentative parcel map may be designated as a remainder for the purpose of an exception to the survey requirements, in compliance with the following provisions: 
a.  Any remainder shall have a gross area of five acres or more. 
b.  Any remainder so designated shall not be considered to be a building site. 
c.  Any remainder so designated shall not be improved with any building or structure that is subject to the requirements of the Uniform Building Code. 
(3)  Whenever a parcel of real property lies partially within the City and partially within an unincorporated area or another city, any proposal to subdivide such real property shall be consistent with existing City boundaries. No lot or parcel, except proposed public or private street rights-of way, shall be partially within the City and partially within an unincorporated area or other city. Any portion of such real property lying within the City, an unincorporated area or other city, shall be included on the tentative map for the purpose of showing the remainder parcel, but any approving action on the tentative map by the City shall not be construed as approval of any design or improvements shown within the other city or unincorporated area. 
(4)  Regardless of its size, no portion of any property shown on the latest equalized County assessment roll as a unit or contiguous units shall be excluded from within the boundaries of a subdivision for the purpose of avoiding dedication or improvement of any street, drainage or flood control facility.

Such plans shall contain an estimate of the total costs of constructing the local drainage and sewer facilities required by the plan and a map of the area showing its boundaries and the location of the planned facilities. 
(2)  Upon filing of a final tract or parcel map and as a condition of approval of said final tract or parcel map, a drainage and sewer fee shall be paid in the amount set forth in the legislative action adopting and establishing a master plan of drainage and sewer facilities, if any, within which any portions of the subdivision may lie. Such charges and fees collected as a condition of subdivision approval shall hereinafter be referred to as drainage and sewer fees. In the event local drainage and sewer facilities are being constructed by the subdivider in conjunction with the subdivider's improvements, an agreement to construct said local drainage and sewer facilities may be accepted in lieu of part or all payment of drainage and sewer fees. 
(3)  The funds derived from the drainage and sewer fees shall be used for purposes of defraying the cost of designing and constructing planned local drainage and sewer facilities for the removal of surface and storm waters from the local drainage and sewer area described in such master plan of drainage and sewer facilities. 
(4)  The City Council, in adopting a master plan of drainage and sewer facilities, shall find and determine that the subdivision and development of property will require construction of the facilities described in said master plan and that the drainage and sewer fees are fairly apportioned within the local drainage and sewer area, both on the basis of benefits conferred on property proposed for subdivision and on the need for local drainage and sewer facilities within such area which would be assessable on such property if such costs were apportioned uniformly on a per-acre basis. 
(5)  The fee as to any property proposed for subdivision within an area covered by a master plan of drainage and sewer facilities shall not exceed the pro rata share of the amount of the total estimated cost of all facilities within such area would be assessable on such property if such costs were apportioned uniformly on a per-acre basis. 
(6)  Drainage and sewer fees required by this Section shall be paid into a local drainage and sewer facilities fund. A separate fund shall be established for each local drainage area. Moneys in such funds shall be expended for design and construction engineering and administrative services for those local drainage and sewer facilities within the planned local drainage and sewer area from which the fees comprising the fund were collected. 
(7)  At the discretion of the City Council, rights-of-way dedication, actual construction and design by a duly registered civil engineer, and payment of plan check, engineering and inspection fees for the improvement of local drainage and sewer facilities described in a duly adopted master plan of drainage and sewer facilities may be accepted in lieu of the payment of drainage and sewer fees. 
(8)  Moneys may be advanced by the City from its General Fund or other sources to pay the cost of local drainage and sewer facilities within a local drainage and sewer area having a duly adopted master plan of drainage and sewer facilities, and subsequently such moneys advanced may be reimbursed from the local drainage and sewer facilities fund for the local drainage and sewer area in which the drainage and sewer facilities described in the master plan were constructed. 
(9)  When required for the implementation of a duly adopted master plan of drainage and sewer facilities so as to provide adequate drainage for a subdivision, an agreement may be entered into between the subdivider and City whereby the subdivider may advance funds for local drainage and sewer facilities within a local drainage and sewer area, provided that the sole security for payment of funds or other consideration advanced shall be moneys subsequently accruing to a local drainage and sewer facilities fund for said local drainage and sewer area in which the facilities are constructed. Reimbursement shall be for the amount advanced only and shall not include interest or other charges. 
(10)  After completion of the facilities and the payment of all claims from any planned local drainage and sewer facilities fund, the City Council shall determine by resolution the amount of surplus, if any, remaining in any of such funds. Any such surplus shall be used, in such amounts as the City Council may determine, for one or more of the following purposes: 
a.  For transfer to the General Fund of the City, provided that the amount of such transfer shall not exceed five percent of the total amount expended from the particular fund; 
b.  For the construction of additional or modified facilities within the particular drainage or sewer area; or 
c.  As a refund in the manner provided in Subsection (11). 
(11)  Any surplus remaining in a planned local drainage and sewer facilities fund shall be refunded as follows: 
a.  There shall be refunded to the current owners of property for which a fee was previously collected the balance of such moneys in the same proportion which each individual fee collected bears to the total of all individual fees collected from the particular drainage or sewer area. 
b.  Where property for which a fee was previously collected has subsequently been divided into more than one lot, each current owner of a lot shall share in the refund payable to the owners of the property for which a fee was previously collected in the same proportion which the area of each individual lot bears to the total area of the property for which a fee was previously collected. 
c.  There shall be transferred to the General Fund of the City any remaining portion of the surplus which has not been paid to or claimed by the persons entitled thereto within two years from the date either of the completion of the improvements or the adoption by the City Council of a resolution declaring a surplus, whichever is later to occur.

A certified copy of such resolution shall be recorded with the City Clerk; 
b.  Such apportioned fees shall be applicable to all property within the area of benefit and shall be payable as a condition of approval of a final map or as a condition of issuing a building permit for such property or portions thereof. Where the area of benefit includes lands not subject to the payment of fees pursuant to this Section, the City Council shall make provisions for payment of the share of improvement cost apportioned to such lands from other sources. 
c.  Written protest will be received by the City Clerk at any time prior to the close of the public hearing. If written protests are filed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented by the protests to less than one-half of the area to be benefited, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned, and the City Council shall not, for one year from the filing of said written protests, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same improvement under the provisions of this Section. Any protests may be withdrawn by the owner making the same, in writing, at any time prior to the close of the public hearing. 
d.  If any majority protest is directed against only a portion of the improvement, then all further proceedings under the provisions of this Section to construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year, but the City Council shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings not including any part of the improvement so protested against. Such proceedings shall be commenced by a new notice and public hearing as set forth in Subsection (6). 
e.  Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the City Council, within such one-year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of an improvement or portion of improvements so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited are in favor of going forward with such improvement or portion thereof. 
(8)  Fees paid pursuant to this Section shall be deposited in a planned major thoroughfare and bridge fees fund, established for each planned bridge facility project or each planned major thoroughfare project. If the area of benefit is one in which more than one bridge or major thoroughfare is required to be constructed, a separate fund may be established covering all of the bridge projects or major thoroughfares in the area of benefit. If the area of benefit encompasses one or more bridges and one or more thoroughfares and all lands within the area of benefit are subject to the same proportionate fee for all bridges and thoroughfares, a single fund may be established to account for fees paid. Moneys in such fund shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of the improvements serving the area to be benefited and from which the fees comprising the fund were collected, or to reimburse the City for the costs of constructing the improvement. 
(9)  The City Council may approve the acceptance of considerations in lieu of the payment of fees established herein. 
(10)  The City Council may approve the advancement of money from the General Fund or other applicable fund to pay the costs of constructing the improvements covered herein and may reimburse that fund for such advances from planned bridge facility or major thoroughfare funds established pursuant to this Section. 
(11)  If the subdivider, as a condition of approval of the subdivision, is required or desires to construct a bridge or major thoroughfare, the City Council may enter into a reimbursement agreement with the subdivider. Such agreement may provide for payments to the subdivider from the bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund covering that specific project to reimburse the subdivider for costs not allocated to the subdivider's property in the resolution establishing the area of benefit. If the bridge or major thoroughfare fund covers more than one project, reimbursements shall be made on a pro-rata basis reflecting the actual or estimated costs of the projects covered by the fund.

As to taxes or special assessments which are a lien but not yet payable, the subdivider shall cause to be issued and filed with the Treasurer-Tax Collector a certificate giving his estimate of the amount of taxes and special assessments which are a lien but not yet payable. 
(b)  Security.

(1)  When a subdivision is proposed to be created through the tentative parcel map process, a final parcel map shall be filed for record with the County Recorder. No proposed subdivision shall be complete until such parcel map has been filed for record, unless a waiver has been approved. 
(2)  A final parcel map, within commercial or industrial zoned areas, identifying lease lines or lines for tax purposes may be filed for record with the County Recorder without being required to comply with the tentative parcel map requirements of this Chapter. Each parcel on such map shall be identified by letter and shall not be considered to be a separate building site. No transfers of fee title may be made in connection with such map. Identification shall be shown on the face of such map as to its purpose that it does not create building sites and that it does not permit transfer of fee title interest. 
(c)  Signatures required. 
(1)  When dedications or offers of dedications, either limited or irrevocable, are made on the final parcel map, all parties having any record title interest in the real property being subdivided, including parties to which an irrevocable offer of dedication has been made over the property, or any portion thereof, shall consent to the preparation and recordation of the final parcel map by signing the required certificate. Such signatures shall be properly acknowledged. The certificate need not be signed by public entities and public utilities which own rights-of-way, easements or other interests which cannot ripen into a fee, provided that: 
a.  The Planning Commission determines that division and development of the property in the manner set forth on the tentative map will not unreasonably interfere with the free and complete exercise of the public entity or public utility right-of-way or easement; 
b.  The map contains a statement that the Planning Commission has determined that the division and development of the property in the manner set forth on the map will not unreasonably interfere with the free and complete exercise of the public entity or public utility right-of-way or easement; and

In the event the subdivider fails to make reasonable progress in meeting the requirements identified by the Development Services Director for continued processing of the final parcel map, as set forth in Subsection (2), the map shall be presumed not to conform to the tentative parcel map and not to have satisfied the conditions of approval and no further processing of the map shall be required. However, the Development Services Director may cause the map to be forwarded to the City Council with a recommendation that the map be denied for failure to comply with the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act and this Chapter. 
(5)  If and when the final parcel map submittal complies with the requirements of Subsection (2), the Development Services Director shall notify the subdivider and the City Engineer of his/her preliminary decision within ten days of receipt of the final map submittal. 
(6)  The subdivider may submit additional information in response to the notice provided by the Development Services Director.

(4)  The surveyor or engineer shall be permitted to show on any record of survey submitted for filing, the information prescribed above, when the normal course of survey activities include ties made to points for which coordinates have been provided or accepted into the control network by the City, and when such information may be shown pursuant to the requirements of the Public Resources Code. 
(5)  The City shall require the surveyor or engineer preparing the parcel map to tie the boundary of said map into the CCS NAD 83/90 in at least two locations, preferably on opposite sides of the boundary or as mutually agreed to by the surveyor or engineer and the City Engineer. 
(6)  The basis of bearings of the parcel map shall be the CCS NAD 83/90 Adjustment or current adjustment as directed by the City Engineer as established by the use of existing monuments, Global Positioning System Surveys (GPS), or by astronomic observation. 
(7)  In the event that the City Engineer is unable to provide the surveyor or engineer with coordinated monuments, as described in Subsection (1), within 30 days of a written request filed by the surveyor or engineer relating to any maps which is or will be processed by the City Engineer, the foregoing requirements may be waived. However, none of the above will preclude a person, authorized to practice land surveying within the State, from performing the necessary work to meet the requirements of this Section. 
(8)  The City Engineer shall require the surveyor or engineer preparing a parcel map to submit to the City, in addition to the material currently being submitted for map checking and recordation purposes, a digital graphics file containing the boundary, street centerline, right-of-way and lot/parcel line data necessary to facilitate transferring of the file into the City mapping system if the surveyor or engineer has the capability to provide such files. If the surveyor or engineer does not have this capability, the City shall create such a graphics file for entry into its system and recover the cost through the map check process. 
(9)  If the boundary of the parcel map being submitted is a parcel or lot of a map already tied to the CCS NAD 83/90 or current adjustment as directed by the City Engineer, the requirements in Subsection (5) shall be waived. 
(10)  In the event the surveyor or engineer submitting a parcel map to the City feels that compliance with the requirements stated in Subsections (3), (5), (6) and (8) will create a hardship on him/her or the client, he/she may appeal to the City Engineer to waive them. If the City Engineer refuses this appeal, the surveyor or engineer may further appeal this decision to a committee of members of the private sector recognized by the City Engineer as representative of the professional surveying community. Such a committee may be, but is not limited to, the California Land Surveyors Association, the California Council of Civil Engineers and Land Surveyors Joint Professional Practice Committee. The decision of this committee shall be final and binding on both parties.

(Ord. No. 07-03, § 4(Exh. A), 4-11-2007; Ord. No. 07-07, § 2, 11-14-2007)  
Sec. 9.11.020. - Requirements for subdivisions. 
(a)  Requirements. Any person who proposes to divide real property for the purpose of creating a residential subdivision or a parcel map for residential use shall pay a park fee or provide park land in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter. 
(b)  Method of fulfilling requirements. The requirements of this Chapter shall be complied with by the provision of park land or the payment of park fees, or by a combination of both. Provision of park land shall not be required for parcel maps or subdivisions containing 50 parcels or less; except that when a condominium project, stock cooperative or community apartment project exceeds 50 dwelling units, dedication of land may be required notwithstanding that the number of parcels may be less than 50. Whenever a person proposes to provide park land, such person shall comply with the requirements of Subsection (h). 
(c)  Amount of park land required. 
(1)  When the requirements of this Code are met solely on the basis of dedicating park land, the amount of land to be provided shall be computed by multiplying the number of proposed dwelling units by the park land acres per dwelling unit in accordance with the appropriate density classification in the following table: 
Dwellings Units Per Gross Acre 	Persons Per Dwelling Unit 	Park Land Acres Per Dwelling Unit 
Up to 6.5 	3.21 	0.016 
6.6 to 15.5 	2.59 	0.013 
15.6 to 25.5 	1.99 	0.010 
25.6 and up 	1.88 	0.009 
 
(2)  In the event the area to be dedicated is bounded or abutted by existing or proposed street frontage, the subdivider shall, at the time of approval of the tentative map, agree to a condition to provide curbs, gutters, sidewalk, drainage facilities, street lighting, stop lights, street signs, matching pavement and street trees to full city standards, to stub-in requested standard improvements required for residential property plus initial on site grading required for developing the park facility; provided, however, that, with the approval of the Planning Commission or City Council, whichever acts last on the tentative map, and in lieu of making said improvements, the subdivider may pay a sum as estimated by the City Engineer sufficient to cover the cost of said improvements. 
(d)  Amount of park fees required. 
(1)  When the requirements of this Code are met solely on the basis of the payment of park fees, the amount of such fees shall be computed by multiplying the number of proposed dwelling units by the park land acres per dwelling unit shown in the table of Subsection (c), and by multiplying the resultant acreage amount by the land value of the land being developed, per acre. 
(2)  The land value shall be based on the average per acre value of the property to be subdivided at the time of recording the final subdivision map, adjusted to reflect the value of such an acre of property rough graded to a maximum one percent slope. Fair market value shall be determined as of the date on which the parcel or final map is filed. 
(3)  Land value initially shall be determined by negotiations between the Development Services Director and the subdivider. If these negotiations are unsuccessful, the land value shall be determined by a member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI) mutually agreed upon by the Development Services Director and the subdivider. The subdivider shall pay for the cost of the appraisal. The subdivider shall select the appraiser from a list of three provided by the Development Services Director. 
(4)  In addition to the fee to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the subdivider shall also pay an amount equal to 20 percent of the in-lieu fee to provide curbs, gutters, drainage facilities, street lighting, stop lighting, stop lights, sidewalks, street signs, matching pavement and street trees to full city standards, stubbing in of requested utility line services to the park facility, and all standard improvements required by the City for residential subdivisions. 
(5)  Following recommendations received from the Planning Commission, the City Council may modify by resolution the above procedure for determining land value. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Amount of park land and park fees combined. Whenever the requirements of this Chapter are complied with by both the provision of park land and payment of park fee, the amount of the park fee shall be computed by determining the required amount of park land in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (c). and subtracting the amount of park land actually provided. The remainder shall be converted to a fee in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (d). 
(g)  Improvement of dedicated park land. If the person is required to provide dedicated park land and provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land pursuant to a development plan approved by the City, the value of the improvements together with any equipment located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land required by this Chapter. Value of such improvements shall be the cost to the developer. 
(h)  Park land requirements. Any person meeting either all or part of the requirements of this Chapter by providing park land shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  If the proposed park land is within or contiguous to the boundary of a tentative tract or parcel map, it shall be shown on the tentative tract or parcel map. 
(2)  If the proposed park land is outside the boundary of the tentative tract or parcel map, it shall be shown on a separate map accompanying the tentative tract map or shall be consistent with an approved park implementation plan. 
(3)  If the Planning Commission makes a determination that the future residents will be better served by the establishment of a park in a different location than that proposed, it may require payment of a park fee for all or part of the required park land, and the amount of park land required to be shown on the tentative map shall be reduced by an equivalent amount. 
(4)  Any proposal to provide park land on real property zoned for multiple residential uses shall include a statement on the face of the map specifying the number of proposed dwelling units, and the amount of park land required shall be computed on the basis of the number of dwelling units shown on the face of the map. If the number of building permits for dwelling units exceeds the amount proposed on the face of the tentative map, an appropriate park fee in accordance with the requirements of Subsection (d). shall be paid for the additional dwelling units or additional acreage dedicated. 
(5)  Each proposal to provide park land shall require a determination by the Development Services Director as to compliance with the regulations, standards and criteria specified by this Title and the conservation/open space element of the General Plan. The Development Services Director shall report all findings to the Planning Commission. All park land shown on a tentative tract or parcel map or a subdivision of land shall be recorded on a final tract map or a parcel map. Such map shall include an irrevocable offer of dedication to the City. 
(i)  Park fee procedures. Park fees shall be approved by the Planning Commission. The amount of park fees shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (d), based on the value of the land being developed at the time the building permits are issued. Fees shall be paid prior to issuance of building permits or at such time as otherwise provided by resolution of the City Council. 
Any recommendation of approval of the payment of park fees shall be made by the Planning Commission prior to or concurrently with the approval of the tentative map, and such approval shall be shown on the face of the tentative map and by conditions of approval. 
(j)  Change in requirements after approval of tentative map or division of land. If any person proposes to change the amount of the park land or the payment of the park fee, or the size, shape, location, terrain or improvements of the park shown on an approved tentative tract map, or tentative parcel map, such change shall be deemed to be a revision of the tentative tract map or tentative parcel map, and shall require the filing of a new or revised map. 
(k)  Standards. All required local park land provided in compliance with this Chapter shall comply with the standards and criteria contained in the conservation/open space element of the General Plan.

--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 16-06, § 2, adopted Oct. 26, 2016, repealed the former Ch. 10.01, § 10.01.010, and enacted a new Ch. 10.01 as set out herein. The former Ch. 10.01 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 10-08, § 2, adopted Dec. 8, 2010; and Ord. No. 13-03, § 2, adopted Dec. 11, 2013. 
 
Sec. 10.01.010. - Authority, purpose and findings. 
(a)  Authority . Health and Safety Code Section 17958 et seq., authorizes the City to adopt ordinances and regulations imposing the same requirements as are contained in the California Building Standards (California Code of Regulations, Title 24) adopted by the State pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 17922. Health and Safety Code Sections 17958.5 and 18941.5 permit the City to make changes or modifications to the California Building Standards as are reasonably necessary because such changes or modifications are needed due to climatic, geographic, or topographic conditions. 
(b)  Purpose . The Fire Official and City Building Official recommend that certain changes and modifications to the 2016 California Building Standards are reasonably necessary due to local conditions within the City, certain changes and modifications are of an administrative or procedural nature or concern themselves with subjects not covered by the California Building Standards, and certain changes and modifications are reasonably necessary to safeguard life and property within the City of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
(c)  Findings of local conditions. 
1.  Climatic Conditions: 
A.  Orange County and the City of Rancho Santa Margarita are located in a semi-arid Mediterranean type climate. It annually experiences extended periods of high temperatures with little or no precipitation. Hot, dry (Santa Ana) winds, which may reach speeds of 110 mph or greater, are also common to the area. These climatic conditions cause extreme drying of vegetation and common building materials. Frequent periods of drought and low humidity add to the fire danger. This predisposes the area to large destructive fires (conflagration). In addition to directly damaging or destroying buildings, these fires are also prone to disrupt utility services throughout the County. Obstacles generated by a strong wind, such as fallen trees, street lights and utility poles will greatly impact the response time to reach an incident scene. Additionally, there is a significant increase in the amount of wind force at 60 feet above the ground. Use of aerial type firefighting apparatus above this height would place rescue personnel at increased risk of injury. 
B.  The climate alternates between extended periods of drought and brief flooding conditions. Flood conditions may affect the Orange County Fire Authority's ability to respond to a fire or emergency condition. Floods also disrupt utility services to buildings and facilities within the County. 
C.  Water demand in this densely populated area far exceeds the quantity supplied by natural precipitation; and although the population continues to grow, the already-taxed water supply does not. California is projected to increase in population by nearly 10 million over the next quarter of a century with 50 percent of that growth centered in Southern California. Due to storage capacities and consumption, and a limited amount of rainfall future water allocation is not fully dependable. This necessitates the need for additional and on-site fire protection features. It would also leave tall buildings vulnerable to uncontrolled fires due to a lack of available water and an inability to pump sufficient quantities of available water to floors in a fire. 
D.  These dry climatic conditions and winds contribute to the rapid spread of even small fires originating in high-density housing or vegetation. These fires spread very quickly and create a need for increased levels of fire protection. The added protection of fire sprinkler systems and other fire protection features will supplement normal fire department response by providing immediate protection for the building occupants and by containing and controlling the fire spread to the area of origin. Fire sprinkler systems will also reduce the use of water for firefighting by as much as 50 to 75 percent. 
2.  Topographical conditions: 
A.  Natural slopes of 15 percent or greater generally occur throughout the foothills of Orange County. The elevation change cause by the hills creates the geological foundation on which communities within Orange County are built and will continue to be built. With much of the populated flatlands already built upon, future growth will occur in areas with steeper slopes and greater constraints in terrain. 
B.  Road circulation features located throughout the County also make amendments reasonably necessary. Located through the County are major roadways, highways and flood control channels that create barriers and slow response times. Hills, slopes, street and storm drain design accompanied with occasional heavy rainfall, cause roadway flooding and landslides, and at times may make an emergency access route impassable. There are areas in Orange County that naturally have extended Fire Department emergency response times that exceed the 5 minute goal. 
C.  Placement of multiple occupancy buildings, location of arterial roads, and fire department staffing constraints due to recent revenue-limiting state legislation have made it difficult for the fire department to locate additional fire stations and provide manpower sufficient to concentrate fire companies and personnel to control fires in high density apartment or condominium buildings. Fire Department equipment does not allow easy access to areas of buildings greater than 55 feet above the level of Fire Department vehicle access. These conditions create the need for built-in on-site fire protection systems to protect occupants and property until fire fighting apparatus and personnel arrive on the scene. 
D.  These topographical conditions combine to create a situation, which places fire department response time to fire occurrences at risk, and makes it necessary to provide automatic on-site fire-extinguishing systems and other protection measures to protect occupants and property. 
3.  Geological conditions: 
A.  Orange County and the City of Rancho Santa Margarita are located in a highly active seismic area. There are earthquake faults that run along both the northeastern and southwestern boundaries of Orange County. The Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone (NIFZ) which runs through Orange County was the source of the destructive 1933 Long Beach earthquake (6.3 magnitude, hypocenter off Newport Beach coast), which took 120 lives, with areas damaged from Laguna Beach to Marina del Rey and inland to Whittier, and poses one of the greatest hazards to lives and property in the nation. Regional planning for reoccurrence is recommended by the State of California, Department of Conservation. There was also an earthquake in December 1989, with the epicenter located near the City of Irvine. The fault on which this quake occurred was unknown prior to this activity. The October 17, 1989, Santa Cruz earthquake resulted in only one major San Francisco fire in the Marina district, but when combined with the 34 other fires and over 500 responses, the department was taxed to its full capabilities. The Marina fire was difficult to contain because mains supplying water to the district burst during the earthquake. If more fires had been ignited by the earthquake, it would have been difficult for the fire department to contain them. Experts predict a major earthquake in our area within the next 50 years. This situation creates the need for both additional fire protection measures and automatic on-site fire protection for building occupants since a multitude of fires may result from breakage of gas and electric lines as a result of an earthquake. As noted by "Planning Scenario on a Major Earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone, 1988, State Department of Conservation," page 59, "unfortunately, barely meeting the minimum earthquake standards of building codes places a building on the verge of being legally unsafe." 
B.  Traffic and circulation congestion presently existing in the City of Rancho Santa Margarita often places fire department response time to fire occurrences at risk. This condition will be exacerbated by any major disaster, including any earthquake wherein damage to the highway system will occur. This condition makes the need for additional on-site protection for property occupants necessary. 
C.  The City of Rancho Santa Margarita is located in an area subject to a climatic condition of high winds and low humidity. This combination of events creates an environment, which is conducive to rapidly spreading fires. Control of such fires requires rapid response. Obstacles generated by a strong wind, such as fallen trees, street lights and utility poles, and the requirement to climb 75 feet vertically up flights of stairs will greatly impact the response time to reach an incident scene. Additionally, Section 6, Figure 6-2 of ASCE 7 identifies a significant increase in the amount of wind force at 60 feet above the ground. Use of aerial type fire fighting apparatus above this height would place rescue personnel at increased risk of injury. 
D.  The City of Rancho Santa Margarita is located in the middle of the seismically active area. The viability of the public water system would be questionable at best after a major seismic event. This would leave tall buildings vulnerable to uncontrolled fires due to a lack of available water and an inability to pump sufficient quantities of any available water to floors above the 55-foot level. A severe seismic event has the potential to negatively impact any rescue or fire suppression activities because it is likely to create obstacles similar to those indicated under the high wind section above. With the probability of strong aftershocks there exists a need to provide increased protection for anyone on upper floors. 
E.  Untreated wood roofs cause or contribute to serious fire hazard and to the rapid spread of fires when such fires are accompanied by high winds. Pieces of burning wooden roofs become flying brands and are carried by the wind to other locations and thereby spread fire quickly. Recent Grand Jury Report findings support this concern. 
F.  Soils throughout the County possess corrosive properties that reduce the expected usable life of water services when metallic pipes in contact with soils are utilized. 
G.  Portions of the County contain active or former oil production fields. These areas contain a variety of naturally occurring gases, liquids and vapors. These compounds present toxicity or flammability hazards to building occupants. Evaluation of these hazards and the risks they pose to development is necessary to implement appropriate mitigation. 
Due to the topographical conditions of sprawling development separated by waterways and narrow and congested streets and the expected infrastructure damage inherent in seismic zone described above, it is prudent to rely on automatic fire sprinkler systems to mitigate extended fire department response time and keep fires manageable with reduced fire flow (water) requirements for given structures. Additional fire protection is also justified to match the current resources of firefighting equipment and personnel within the Orange County Fire Authority. 
Additional amendments have been made to the California Building Standards Code and other supplementary codes. Such amendments are hereby found to be either administrative or procedural in nature or concern themselves with subjects not covered in such codes. The changes made include provisions making each of said codes compatible with other codes enforced by the City. 
The amendments to the 2016 California Building Standards Code (California Code of Regulations, Title 24) set forth herein, and indexed in the following table, are reasonably necessary because of the local climatic, geological and topographical conditions presented.

(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City may be subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by uses being inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effects of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights and velocities, also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(3.20.020), 6-21-2001)  
Sec. 10.11.030. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize" public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(3.20.030), 6-21-2001)  
Sec. 10.11.040. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

Fraud and Victimization, as related to Section 10.11.240, [nature of] variances, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
Governing body is the local governing unit, i.e., the City Council of the City, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
Hardship as related to Section 10.11.240, [nature of] variances, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance. Even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "basement"). 
(1)  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet floodproofing standard in subsection 10.11.170(3). 
b.  The anchoring standards in subsection 10.11.170(1). 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in subsection 10.11.170(2). 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 10.11.180. 
(2)  For residential structures, all subgrade-enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Market value shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the foodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
New construction , for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. 
Obstruction includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carded downstream. 
One hundred-year flood or 100-year flood. (See "base flood"). 
Public safety and nuisance as related to Section 10.11.240, [nature of] variances, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance shall not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designated to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on the FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, or AH. 
Start of construction includes proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption; or 
a.  If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order to administer Section 10.11.170 et seq. 
1.  Simplified method. 
i.  One hundred year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and 
ii.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA; or 
2.  Detailed method. 
i.  One hundred year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' HEC-HMS computer program; and 
ii.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' HEC-RAS computer program. 
(3)  Notification of other agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
(4)  Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available, as needed the following: 
a.  Certification required by subsection 10.11.170(3)a. (lowest floor elevations),

c.  Certification required by subsection 10.11.170(3)c. (wet floodproofing standard), 
d.  Certification of elevation required by subsection 10.11.190(b) (subdivision standards), and 
(5)  Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. 
(6)  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 10.11.090. 
(7)  AR Zone Duties. 
a.  Use the adopted official map or legal description of those designated developed areas within Zones AR, AR/AR1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A, AR/AO, to determine if a proposed project is in a developed area. 
b.  Determine the base flood elevation to be used for individual projects within developed areas, areas not designated as developed areas, and dual zone areas. 
c.  Require the applicable standards in Sections 10.11.170 et seq. 
d.  Provide written notification to the permit applicant that the area has been designated as an AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A Zone and whether the structure will be elevated or protected to or above the AR base flood elevation.

a.  With flood resistant materials as specified in FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 2-93, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
b.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
c.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if 
d.  Within Zones AH, AO, AR/AH, or AR/AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from the proposed structures. 
(3)  Elevation and flood proofing. 
a.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, 
1.  In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grad if no depth number is specified. (The State of California recommends that in AO Zones without velocity the lowest floor be elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least two feet, or elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.) 
2.  In an A Zone, elevated to or above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods in Section 10.11.150 of this chapter. (The State of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by the community.) 
3.  In all other Zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. (The State of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation.) 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
b.  Non-residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with subsection 10.11.170(3)a. or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities; 
1.  Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under subsection 10.11.170(3)a. so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
2.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
3.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this section are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
c.  All new construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93 and TB 7-93, and must exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; or 
2.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
d.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 10.11.200.

(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(3.20.210), 6-21-2001)  
Sec. 10.11.220. - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 10.11.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply. 
(1)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 10.11.220(1) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 10.11.170. 
(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(3.20.220), 6-21-2001)  
Sec. 10.11.230. - AR Zone Areas. 
Within areas designated as AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO or AR/A as established under Section 10.11.070, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  Developed areas. All new construction in areas designated as developed areas shall meet the standards of Section 10.11.170 using the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  Areas not designated as developed areas. All new construction in areas that are not designated as developed areas: 
a.  Where the AR flood depth is equal to or less than five feet above the highest adjacent grade, shall meet the standards of Section 10.11.170 using the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is 13 feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
b.  Where the AR flood depth is greater than five feet above the highest adjacent grade, shall meet the standards of Section 10.11.170 using the AR base flood elevation. 
(3)  Dual zone areas. 
a.  All new construction in areas within Zone AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AR/A shall meet the standards of Section 5.0 using the higher of either the applicable AR Zone elevation (as determined from subsections 10.11.230(1) or (2) above) or the base flood elevation (or flood depth) for the underlying A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A Zone. 
b.  All substantial improvements to existing construction within Zones AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A shall meet the standard of Section 10.11.170 using the base flood elevation (or flood depth) for the underlying A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A Zone. 
(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(3.20.230), 6-21-2001)  
Sec. 10.11.240. - Nature of variances. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the City to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(3.20.240), 6-21-2001)  
Sec. 10.11.250. - Appeal board. 
(a)  In passing upon requests for variances, the City shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
(1)  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such, damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
(4)  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
(11)  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
(b)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall he recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Orange County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(c)  The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 01-06, § 1(3.20.250), 6-21-2001)  
Sec. 10.11.260. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 10.11.140 et seq. and 10.11.170 et seq., of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
(c)  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
(3)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 10.11.050 of this chapter), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 10.11.050) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections 3.20.260(a) through 3.20.260(e) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
(e)  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 10.11.250(a) and the purposes of this chapter, the City may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 00-12, § 1(3), 3-2-2000)  
Sec. 11.08.040. - Payment of fees; where required. 
(a)  Payment of fees shall not be required unless any major thoroughfare is in addition to or a widening or reconstruction of any existing major thoroughfare serving the area at the time of the adoption of the boundaries of the area of benefit.

(Ord. No. 00-12, § 1(45), 3-2-2000)  
Sec. 11.08.050. - Establishment of area of benefit; proposal. 
Action to establish an area of benefit may be initiated by the City Council upon its own motion or upon the recommendation of the City Engineer or other designated City employee. The proposal shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for its review and recommendations. The Planning Commission comments and recommendations and the City Engineer's report shall be transmitted to the City Council. The City Council shall set a public hearing for each proposed area benefited. Notice of the time and place of said hearing, including preliminary information related to the boundaries of the area of benefit, estimated costs and the method of fee apportionment, shall be given by first class mail addressed to each owner as shown on the last equalized assessment roll of property within the proposed area of benefit. 
(Ord. No. 00-12, § 1(6), 3-2-2000)  
Sec. 11.08.060. - Public hearing and protests. 
(a)  At the public hearing the City Council shall consider the testimony, written protests, and other evidence. At the conclusion of the public hearing the City Council may, unless a majority written protest is filed and not withdrawn as specified in Subsection(c) hereof, establish an area of benefit. If established, the City Council shall adopt a resolution describing the boundaries of the area of benefit, setting forth the cost, whether actual or estimated, and the method of fee apportionment. A certified copy of such resolution shall be recorded with the County Recorder of Orange County. 
(b)  Such apportioned fees shall be applicable to all property within the area of benefit and shall be payable as a condition of approval of a final map or as a condition of issuing a building permit for such property or portions thereof. Where the area of benefit includes lands not subject to the payment of fees pursuant to this section, the City Council shall make provisions for payment of the share of improvement costs apportioned to such lands from other sources. 
(c)  Written protest shall be received by the City Clerk any time prior to the close of the public hearing. If written protests are filed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented by the protests to less than 1/2 of the area to be benefited, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned, and the City Council shall not, for one year from the filing of said written protests, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same improvement under the provisions of this section, unless the protests are overruled by an affirmative vote of 4/5 of the City Council. Any protests may be withdrawn by the owner making the same, in writing, at any time prior to the close of the public hearing. 
(d)  If any majority protest is directed against only a portion of the improvement, then all further proceedings under the provisions of this section to construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year, but the City Council shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings not including any part of the improvement so protested against. Such proceedings shall be commenced by a new notice and public hearing as set forth in Section 11.08.050 above. 
(e)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the City Council, within such one-year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of an improvement or portion of the improvements so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of 4/5 of its members, that the owners of more than 1/2 of the area of the property to be benefited are in favor of going forward with such improvement or portion thereof. 
(Ord. No. 00-12, § 1(7), 3-2-2000)  
Sec. 11.08.070. - Bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund. 
Fees paid pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a planned bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund. A fund shall be established for each planned bridge facility project or each planned major thoroughfare project. If the area of benefit is one in which more than one bridge or major thoroughfare is required to be constructed, a separate fund may be established covering all of the bridge projects or major thoroughfares in the area of benefit. If the area of benefit encompasses one or more bridges and one or more thoroughfares and all lands within the area of benefit are subject to the same proportionate fee for all bridges and thoroughfares, a single fund may be established to account for fees paid. Moneys in such fund shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of improvements serving the area to be benefited and from which the fees comprising the fund were collected, or to reimburse the City for the costs of constructing the improvement.

If the subdivider, as a condition of approval of the subdivision, or the building permit applicant, as a condition of the issuance of the building permit, is required or desires to construct a bridge or major thoroughfare, the City Council may enter into a reimbursement agreement with the subdivider or building permit applicant and the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency. Such agreement may provide for payments to the subdivider or applicant from the bridge facility or major thoroughfare fund covering that specific project to reimburse the subdivider or applicant for costs not allocated to the subdividers or applicant's property in the resolution establishing the area of benefit. If the bridge or major thoroughfare fund covers more than one project, reimbursements shall be made on a pro rata basis reflecting the actual or estimated costs of the projects covered by the fund.
