HILLSBOROUGH, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the Town of Hillsborough, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 9, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Hillsborough Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1982, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Frank B. Ingersoll, city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 9, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 754, passed February 11, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 9, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this Code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your Code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

Chapter 1.12 - ARREST PROCEDURE 
Sections: 

1.12.010 - Citations for violations. 
A.  In any case in which a person is arrested for an offense declared to be a misdemeanor and does not demand to be taken before a magistrate, that person shall be released according to the procedures set forth in this section. If the person is released, the arresting officer shall prepare in duplicate a written notice to appear in court, containing the name and address of the person, the offense charged, the time when and the place where the person shall appear in court. 
B.  The time specified in the notice to appear shall be not less than ten days after such arrest. 
C.  The place specified in the notice to appear shall be either: 
1.  Before a judge of the municipal court within San Mateo County who has jurisdiction of the offense and who is nearest and most accessible with reference to where the arrest is made; or 
2.  Upon demand of the person arrested, before a judge of the municipal court in the judicial district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed; or 
3.  Before an officer authorized to receive a deposit of bail. 
D.  The officer shall deliver one copy of the notice to appear to the arrested person and the arrested person, in order to secure a release, shall give his written promise to appear in court by signing the duplicate notice, which shall be retained by the officer. Thereupon the arresting officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody. 
E.  The officer shall, as soon as practicable, file a duplicate with the magistrate specified in such notice. The arrested person may, prior to the date upon which he promised to appear in court, deposit with the magistrate the amount of bail set by such magistrate. Thereafter at the time when the case is called for arraignment before the magistrate, if the defendant does not appear, either in person or by counsel, the magistrate may declare the bail forfeited and may at his discretion order that no further proceedings shall be made in such case. 
F.  A warrant shall not issue on such charge for the arrest of a person pursuant to the provisions of this code when said person has given written promise to appear in court, unless and until he has violated such promise, or has failed to deposit bail, to appear for arraignment, trial or judgment, or to comply with the terms and provisions of the judgment as required by law. 
G.  When a person signs a written promise to appear at the time and place specified in the citation and has not posted bail as provided in subsection E of this section, the magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a warrant for his arrest within twenty days after his failure to appear as promised. If a person promises to appear before an officer authorized to accept bail other than a magistrate and fails to do so on or before the date promised, then within twenty days after the delivery by the officer of such written promise to a magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense, such magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a warrant for said person's arrest. When such person violates his promise to appear before an officer authorized to receive bail other than a magistrate, the officer shall immediately deliver to the magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense charged the written promise to appear and the complainant, if any, filed by the arresting officer. 
H.  Every person violating the provisions of this chapter of failing to comply with his written promise to appear in court is guilty of a misdemeanor regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he was originally arrested, and violation of any portion, section or subsection of this code shall be punishable as provided in this chapter.

Chapter 3.30 - SPECIAL TAX FOR POLICE PROTECTION AND FIRE PROTECTION AND PREVENTION 
Sections: 

3.30.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to authorize the levy of a special non-ad valorem tax on parcels of real property on the secured property tax roll of San Mateo County that are within the town of Hillsborough. Such special tax (to be known as the special police and fire tax) shall augment funding to maintain and enhance police protection and fire protection and prevention services in Hillsborough, including obtaining, furnishing, operating and maintaining fire suppression and police protection equipment and apparatus, paying the salaries and benefits to firefighting and police protection personnel and for other necessary fire protection and prevention expenses and police protection expenses. The revenues raised by this special police and fire tax shall be used solely for these purposes. 
(Ord. 563 § 2 (part), 1998) 
3.30.020 - Authority. 
A.  The tax authorized by this chapter is a special tax within the meaning of Section 4 of Article XIIIA and Section l(d) of Article XIIIC of the California Constitution, and this chapter is enacted pursuant to Government Code Sections 53978 and 50077, both of which authorize the town to propose by ordinance the adoption of a special tax. Although the burden of this tax falls upon property, this tax is not determined according to, nor is it in any manner based upon, the value of property. Rather, in accordance with Government Code Section 53978(b) (which permits the special tax to be levied on a parcel, class of improvement to property, or use of property basis, or a combination thereof), every improved parcel in Hillsborough is to be assessed the same amount of special tax and every unimproved parcel is to be assessed the same amount of special tax pursuant to this chapter. (Unimproved parcels are assessed a lower amount than improved parcels, not because of any valuation considerations, but because they use less police and fire protection services.) 
B.  Pursuant to Section 3.30.050 of this chapter, and as authorized by Government Code Sections 53978(d) and 50077(b), and to the extent that Government Code Sections 53978 and 50077 are consistent with the provisions of this chapter, such sections are intended to apply to the collection and administration of this special police and fire tax (as are those provisions of the California Revenue and Taxation Code and of Articles XIII and XIIIA of the California Constitution that relate to the collection and administration of real property taxes to the extent that such provisions are applicable to a non-ad valorem property tax). 
(Ord. 563 § 2 (part), 1998) 
3.30.030 - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply throughout this chapter: 
    "Fiscal year" means the period of July 1st through the following June 30th. 
    "Improved parcel" means a parcel upon which any improvement exists, provided it shall not include any unimproved parcel, as hereinafter defined. The town records as of January 1st of each year shall determine for the upcoming fiscal year whether a parcel is improved. 
    "Parcel" means the land and any improvements thereon, designated as an identifiable parcel in the official records of the assessor of San Mateo County by an assessor's parcel map or parcel number and carried on the secured property tax roll of the county of San Mateo. It is provided, however, that "parcel" shall not include any land or improvement wholly outside the boundaries of the town of Hillsborough nor any land or improvement owned by any federal or state governmental agency or another local agency, including, without limitation, any public school district. 
    "Unimproved parcel" means a parcel which is not improved with any building, structure or other appurtenance located on the land. A parcel improved only with trees, other vegetation, walls that are not a part of or connected to a structure, water wells, fences or poles shall be deemed an unimproved parcel. 
(Ord. 563 § 2 (part), 1998) 
3.30.040 - Tax levy and rates. 
A.  The maximum special police and fire tax for each fiscal year shall not exceed the following amounts: 
1.  For each improved parcel: ..... $496.00 for fiscal year 98-99 
    For each fiscal year thereafter, the tax shall be the previous fiscal year's tax plus two percent, but never to exceed a total annual tax of one hundred fifteen (115) percent of four hundred ninety-six dollars, all subject to reduction on a year-by-year basis as set forth in subsection B of this section. 
2.  For each unimproved parcel: ..... $190.00 for fiscal year 98-99 
    For each fiscal year thereafter, the tax shall be the previous fiscal year's tax plus two percent, but never to exceed a total annual tax of one hundred fifteen (115) percent of one hundred ninety dollars, all subject to reduction on a year-by-year basis as set forth in subsection B of this section. 
B.  If for any fiscal year the city council determines that the full amount of the special police and fire tax for such fiscal year, as set forth in subsection A of this section, is not required to meet the projected expenditures of the town for police protection and fire protection and prevention services for such year, the city council, by simple majority vote, may direct that only a portion, including no part at all, of the authorized special police and fire tax for such fiscal year shall be collected, as the city council deems appropriate. It is provided, however, that the same percentage reduction shall be made in the tax on each type of parcel specified in subsection A of this section. Such reduction in collection shall be effective only for the fiscal year for which such determination is made and shall have no effect whatsoever on the calculation of the amount of the special police and fire tax for any succeeding fiscal year pursuant to the formula set forth in subsection A of this section. 
C.  In no case shall the amount of the special police and fire tax exceed the maximum amount for each fiscal year as established in subsection A of this section without voter approval. 
D.  The special police and fire tax shall be levied and otherwise imposed upon each parcel each fiscal year after the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective, beginning with fiscal year 1998-1999, and shall be due and collectible as set forth in Section 3.30.050 hereof. 
(Ord. 563 § 2 (part), 1998) 
3.30.050 - Collection and administration. 
A.  The amount of the special police and fire tax for each parcel each year shall constitute a lien on such property, in accordance with Revenue and Taxation Code Section 2187, and shall have the same effect as an ad valorem real property tax lien until fully paid. 
B.  The special police and fire tax on each parcel shall be added to the secured roll for ad valorem property taxes (provided, however, that such placement shall not be deemed to cause the special police and fire tax to become an ad valorem property tax) and shall be due to the town. Insofar as feasible and allowed by law and insofar as not inconsistent with this chapter, the special police and fire tax shall be collected by the San Mateo County tax collector and auditor on behalf of the town in the same manner in which the county collects ad valorem property taxes on the secured roll. Also, insofar as feasible and insofar as not inconsistent with this chapter, the times and procedures regarding due dates, installment payments, corrections, penalties, liens, and collections for secured roll ad valorem property taxes shall be applicable to the collection of this special police and fire tax. In addition, the town shall be entitled to exercise any other lawful remedies provided by law for collection of the indebtedness. The property owner of record shall be responsible for payment of the special police and fire tax, whether or not such owner is an occupant. The secured roll tax bills shall be the only notices required for this special police and fire tax. 
C.  The reasonable costs incurred by the San Mateo County officers collecting this special police and fire tax shall be deducted from the collected taxes before remittal of the balance to the town. 
D.  If for whatever reason the San Mateo County tax collector and auditor cannot, or does not, collect this special police and fire tax, the city council may choose to have the special police and fire tax collected by the town. 
(Ord. 563 § 2 (part), 1998) 
3.30.060 - Creation of special fund. 
    There is created a special fund, to be known as the police protection and fire protection and prevention fund, into which all revenues generated by this special police and fire tax shall be deposited. Moneys deposited into such fund shall be allocated and expended in accordance with the purposes set forth in Section 3.30.010 of this chapter. The city council shall cause an audit of such fund to be conducted annually, and the city council shall review such audit in a public meeting. The audit required hereunder may be conducted as part of the annual audit of all town finances. 
(Ord. 563 § 2 (part), 1998) 
3.30.070 - Unexpended residue.

The Franchise Agreement shall include those provisions of the Grantee's application for franchise or application for renewal that are finally negotiated and accepted by the Grantor and Grantee. 
    Any franchise granted under the terms and conditions contained herein shall be and remain consistent with federal and state laws and regulations. In the event of conflict between the terms and conditions of the franchise and the general law and/or statutory requirements, the latter shall, without exception, control. 
    Any franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general ordinance provisions contained herein, or hereafter made effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the other codes and ordinances of the Grantor regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction provided such do not conflict with the provisions hereof. 
B.  Franchise Required. No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets in the franchise area or be allowed to operate without a franchise in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
C.  Establishment of Franchise Requirements. The Grantor may establish reasonable and appropriate requirements for new franchises or franchise renewals, and may reasonably modify these requirements from time to time to reflect the state-of-the-art in the cable industry. 
D.  Franchise Area. The Grantor may grant a franchise for all or any defined portion of the City. The service area shall be the entire area defined in the Franchise Agreement. The initial service area shall be that portion of the franchise area scheduled to receive initial service, as stated in the Franchise Agreement. 
E.  Use of Public Streets and Ways. For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications system in the franchise area, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.04.070.J herein, the Grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across, and in any manner employed by any utility, along the public streets and ways within the franchise area such wires, cables, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments, and other property and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of the cable communications system. Subject to applicable law, Grantee shall have the same right as regards private easements if said easements are used by utilities, provided that the owner of said private easement may make a reasonable and nominal charge for said use by Grantee, and shall in no other way hinder or delay Grantee's use thereof. Prior to construction or alteration, however, the Grantee shall in each case file plans with the appropriate Grantor agencies and local utility companies, and receive written approval before proceeding. Grantee shall in any event comply with all applicable Grantor construction codes and procedures. 
F.  Duration. The term of any franchise and all rights, privileges, obligations and restrictions pertaining thereto shall be as specified in the Franchise Agreement unless terminated sooner as hereinafter provided.

A decision shall be made by the Grantor not later than 90 days after the conclusion of all such public hearings based upon an evaluation of the application(s), the hearings, and other information that the Grantor may deem relevant. Grantor may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. 
J.  Transfer of Ownership or Control. 
(a)  Transfer of Franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public.

Grantee shall notify Grantor, in writing, 90 days prior to the transfer contemplated herein. Should 45 calendar days expire from the date of Grantee's notice to Grantor regarding transfer or sale without written response from Grantor indicating objection thereto, then the further requirements of this Section 4.04.040J shall be waived by Grantor. 
(b)  Ownership and Control. Grantee shall be required to notify only Grantor of any proposed sale of Grantee's stock above 25%, but less than 51%. The grantee shall promptly notify in writing the Grantor of any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the Grantee-i.e., a sale of 51% or more of Grantee's stock or any other legal undertaking which changes effective day-to-day control of this franchise from Grantee or its parent to any third party shall require prior approval by Grantor. Every such acquisition of control of the Grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the Grantor shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the Grantor may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the Grantee shall assist the Grantor in any such inquiry. Should 45 calendar days expire from the date of Grantee's notice to Grantor regarding transfer or sale without written response from Grantor indicating objection thereto, then the further requirements of this Section 4.04.040J shall be waived by Grantor. 
    In seeking the Grantor's consent to any change in control, the Grantee shall have the responsibility: 
(1)  To show to the satisfaction of the Grantor whether the proposed purchaser, transferee, or assignee which shall include all officers, directors, and all persons having a legal or equitable interest in 5% or more of its voting stock: 
a.  Has ever been convicted or held liable for acts involving moral turpitude including, but not limited to any violation of federal, state, or local law or regulations, or is presently under an indictment, investigation, or complaint charging such acts; 
b.  Has ever had a judgment in an action for fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation entered against it, her, him, or them by any court of competent jurisdiction; or 
c.  Has pending any legal claim, lawsuit, or administrative proceeding arising out of or involving a cable system. 
(2)  To establish, to the satisfaction of the Grantor, the financial capability of the proposed transferee to operate the franchised system, based on the proposed transferee's aggregate financial commitments and resources. Grantor may request, and Grantee shall cause to be provided, all reasonable financial data relative to the transfer. 
(3)  To establish to the satisfaction of the Grantor that the capability of the proposed transferee is such as shall enable it to maintain and operate the cable system for the remaining term of the franchise under the existing franchise terms, and, upon Grantor's request, to provide adequate and reasonable security for this purpose. 
(c)  The Grantor agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the Grantor that it, or its designee satisfactory to the Grantor, will take control of and operate the cable communications system, in the event of a Grantee default in its financial obligations. In such event, the financial institution shall submit a plan for operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by the Grantor in its discretion and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the Grantor to transfer the franchise to another Grantee. If the Grantor finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical, and other public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the Grantor shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. The consent of the Grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(d)  The consent or approval of the Grantor to any transfer of the franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Grantor in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
(e)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Grantor shall not approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion of construction of the proposed system. 
(f)  In no event shall a transfer of control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the existing Franchise Agreement, or a modified franchise agreement approved by the Grantor. 
K.  Franchise Renewal. Franchise renewal shall be as prescribed by applicable law. 
L.  Police Powers. In accepting a franchise, the Grantee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the lawful police powers of the Grantor to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the Grantor pursuant to such power. 
    Any conflict between the provisions of this ordinance and any other present or future lawful exercise of the Grantor's police power shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to any cable communications system franchise which contains provisions inconsistent with this ordinance shall prevail only if upon such exercise the Grantor finds any emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property, or general welfare or such exercise is mandated by law. 
M.  Franchise Fee. 
(a)  Annual Franchise Payment. A Grantee of a franchise hereunder shall pay to the Grantor an annual fee in an amount as designated in the Franchise Agreement. Such payment shall be in addition only to any one-time, specialized fees which are charged by Grantor to other businesses (such as a business license fee), and commence as of the effective date of the franchise. The Grantor, upon request, shall be furnished a statement, either audited and certified by an independent Certified Public Accountant or certified by a financial officer of the Grantee, prepared and calculated in the same manner as are those statements provided by Grantee for other franchise authorities in Grantee's other systems, reflecting the total amounts of applicable gross revenues for the period covered by the payment. Grantor shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of Grantee's records, and if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of 2% or more, the Grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such audit. 
(b)  Acceptance by Grantor. No acceptance of any payment by the Grantee shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this ordinance or for the performance of any other obligation of the Grantee. 
(c)  Failure to Make Requirement Payment. In the event that any franchise payment or correct recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified in the Franchise Agreement, Grantee shall pay Grantor as additional compensation: 
(1)  An interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate of 10%. 
(d)  Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule indicated in the Franchise Agreement. 
(e)  Any Grantee "pass through" or itemization of franchise fees costs on subscribers' bills shall be in accordance with federal law.

(2)  If the Grantee should fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect, the liability and indemnification coverages or the security fund and bonds as required in the Franchise Agreement.

(5)  If the Grantee's construction, reconstruction, or system extension schedule is delayed for more than six months later than the schedule contained in the Franchise Agreement and Grantor finds that the delay was not excusable under the provisions of Section 4.04.130B, and/or the appropriate provisions of the Franchise Agreement. 
(6)  If the Grantee becomes insolvent, or upon listing of an order for relief in favor of Grantee in a bankruptcy proceeding. 
(b)  Procedure Prior to Revocation. 
(1)  The Grantor shall make written demand that the Grantee comply with any requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule, or regulation or correct any action deemed herein to be cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal, or neglect of Grantee continues for a period of 30 days following such written demand, and Grantee has not commenced corrective action, Grantor may place the issue of termination of the franchise upon a regular Council meeting agenda. The Grantor shall cause legal notice to be served upon Grantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such meeting, of this intent to request such termination, showing the time and place of the meeting, and shall publish said notice at least once, 30 days before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the franchise area. 
(2)  The Grantor shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine, based upon the preponderance of the evidence, and all other requirements of due process, whether the Grantee has committed a material breach of this ordinance or the Franchise Agreement, and, if so, whether such breach was willful and not corrected or in the process of being corrected. 
(3)  If the Grantor determines that the Grantee has committed a material breach as indicated above, then the Grantor may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of such Grantee shall be terminated and security fund and bonds forfeited, provided that Grantor shall first direct the Grantee to take appropriate remedial action within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.

The Grantee shall also notify the subscriber of the subscriber's right to file a complaint with the Grantor in the event the subscriber is dissatisfied with the Grantee's decision.

The subscriber shall make such filing and notification within 10 days of receipt of Grantee's decision or within 10 days of the expiration of the 30-day period, whichever is earlier. 
C.  Review by Grantor. The Grantor shall determine, solely upon a review of a subscriber complaint and the Grantee's decision, if any, whether further action is warranted. In the event the Grantor does not initiate further proceedings within 15 days of the filing of the complaint, the Grantee's proposed action or resolution shall be final. If the Grantor decides to initiate further investigation, Grantor shall require the Grantee and the subscriber to submit, within 120 days of notice thereof, a written statement of the facts and arguments in support of their respective positions. The Grantee or the subscriber may request in such statement that a hearing be conducted by the Grantor. A hearing, if requested, shall be conducted by the Grantor following reasonable notice in writing specifying the time and place for such hearing. The hearing shall be conducted informally, and the parties may offer any evidence pertinent to the dispute. The parties shall produce any additional evidence, including testing reports from the Grantee, which the Grantor may deem necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute. The Grantor shall issue a written decision within 15 days of receipt of the written statements or, if a hearing is requested, within 15 days of the conclusion of the hearing, setting forth the basis of its decision. The Grantor's decision shall be final unless appealed by the Grantee to arbitration. 
D.  Appeals to Arbitration. Any final decision or action of the Grantor relative to a subscriber complaint, including the imposition of damage, if any, may be further appealed by Grantee or the subscriber within ten (10) days of such decision or action by delivering written notice of appeal to the Grantor and the subscriber or Grantee. The Grantor shall notify the subscriber and the Grantee of the notice of appeal. The appeal shall be heard by a three-person arbitration panel. The first arbitrator shall be chosen by the Grantor, and the second arbitrator shall be chosen by the Grantee within ten (10) days of notice of the Grantor's selection. The third arbitrator shall be chosen by the first two arbitrators within ten (10) days after selection of the second arbitrator. The appeal shall be conducted in accordance with procedure established by the arbitration panel. The decision of the panel shall be final. The losing appellant shall pay all costs of both parties. 
E.  Complaint Notification. Grantee shall provide written notice to each subscriber at least once every calendar year describing the procedure established by Grantee for resolving subscriber complaints and of the subscriber's right to have Grantee's response to a subscriber complaint reviewed by the Grantor in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. The notice shall include the name, business address, and business telephone numbers of Grantee's office and of the Grantor office designated to receive complaints. 
F.  Complaint Log. Grantee shall maintain a file of all subscriber complaints. 
G.  Remedies for Violations. The Grantor or the arbitration panel may, as a part of a subscriber complaint decision issued under the provisions of this ordinance, impose damages on the Grantee as specified in the Franchise Agreement.

Chapter 4.05 - STATE VIDEO FRANCHISES 

4.05.010 - Purpose and application. 
    This chapter is designed to regulate video service providers holding state video franchises and operating within the town pursuant to that franchise. On January 1, 2007, the State of California became the sole authority with power to grant state video franchises pursuant to the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 ("DIVCA"), codified at Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq. under the California Public Utilities Commission final rulemaking decision dated March 1, 2007. Pursuant to DIVCA, the Town of Hillsborough shall receive a franchise fee and a fee for public, educational and/or government (PEG) purposes from all state video franchise holders operating within the town. Additionally, the town acquired the responsibility to establish and enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all state video franchise holders operating within the town for violations of customer service standards pursuant to DIVCA. 
(Ord. No. 698, § 2, 2-13-2012) 
4.05.020 - State video franchise and PEG fees. 
    Any state video franchise holder operating within the boundaries of the town shall pay a fee to the town equal to five percent of the "gross revenue" of that state video franchise holder. Gross revenue, for the purposes of this chapter, shall have the definition set forth in California Public Utilities Code § 5860. The state franchise fee shall be remitted to the applicable local entity quarterly, within forty-five days after the end of the quarter for that calendar quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a summary explaining the basis for the calculation of the state franchise fee. If the holder does not pay the franchise fee when due, the holder shall pay a late payment charge at a rate per year equal to the highest prime lending rate equal to ten percent per annum applied to the delinquent amount until paid. If the holder has overpaid the franchise fee, it may deduct the overpayment from its next quarterly payment. 
(Ord. No. 698, § 2, 2-13-2012) 
4.05.030 - PEG support fees. 
(a)  Any state video franchise holder operating within the boundaries of the town shall pay a PEG fee to the town or the town's designee for capital support of public, educational, and/or governmental (PEG) purposes that are consistent with state and federal law equal to no more than one percent of gross revenues, as defined by Section 5870(n) of DIVCA. 
(b)  Upon the expiration of the current local cable franchise, every state franchisee operating within the town shall pay a PEG capital support fee of equal to one percent of gross revenues per subscriber per month. PEG fees shall be remitted in the same manner as franchise fees as provided in Section 4.05.20 above. 
(c)  Pursuant to Section 5870(1) of the California Public Utilities Code, every state franchisee operating within the boundaries of the town shall be responsible for a pro-rata, per subscriber share of any outstanding capital grant payments. 
(Ord. No. 698, § 2, 2-13-2012) 
4.05.040 - PEG channels. 
(a)  Each holder of a state franchise under DIVCA shall provide two PEG channels. 
(b)  All state franchisees shall comply with the provisions of DIVCA related to PEG channels. Without limiting the foregoing, the PEG channels shall be carried on the basic service tier. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried of the basic service tier and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by the incumbent cable operator as defined in Public Utilities Code Section 5830(i) unless prohibited by federal law and shall provide video and sound quality, recording capability, channel accessibility and location equal to, or substantially equal to, that provided by the incumbent cable providers. After the initial designation of PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changes without agreement from the local entity unless the change is required by federal law. 
(c)  A state franchise holder shall have three months from the date town requests the PEG channels to designate the capacity. However, the three-month period shall be tolled by any period during which the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible, including any failure or delay of the incumbent cable operator to make adequate interconnection available, as required by DIVCA. Any state franchise holder who believes that the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible, shall provide to town, in writing, its reasons therefore and its plan for correcting or solving the infeasibility. Town may hold a hearing on the claim of infeasibility and, thereafter, take such action as town deems proper to require the designation and provision of the PEG channels on the state franchise holder's system.

(b)  The city manager or the manager's designee shall monitor the compliance of state video franchise holders with respect to state and federal customer service and protection standards. The city manager or the manager's designee will provide the state video franchise holder written notice of any material breaches of applicable customer service standards, and will allow the state video franchise holder thirty days from the receipt of the notice to remedy the specified material breach. Material breaches not remedied within the thirty-day time period will be subject to the following penalties to be imposed by the town:

The city council shall hear all evidence and relevant testimony and may uphold, modify or vacate the penalty. The town council's decision on the imposition of a penalty shall be final. 
As used herein, "Material Breach" is defined as set forth in DIVCA as Section 5900.

C.  No greater or lesser amount of money shall be charged or received for any business tax or administrative fee hereunder than is specified therefor in this chapter and no license shall be granted or issued for any period of time other than the full tax year provided in this chapter. Subject to the provisions of subparagraphs E through I of this Section 5.04.220, business taxes and administrative fees shall be due and payable on the first day of the first month of the tax year and shall be delinquent if not paid on or before the first working day of the first month of the tax year; provided, however, that business taxes and administrative fees for businesses first conducted in the Town after the first day of the first month of the tax year shall be due and payable prior to the first day said business was conducted in the Town and shall be delinquent if not paid on or before said date. 
D.  No later than 30 days prior to the end of each tax year, the business tax collector shall cause a notice to be sent to all holders of current business licenses reminding said persons of their obligation to obtain a new business license for the coming tax year. A person's obligation to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not be conditioned upon the dispatch or receipt of said notice, however. 
E.  Any person whose business tax (excluding the administrative fee) for a given tax year exceeds $1,000 under the provisions of this chapter (and any other person for whom full payment of the business tax in a single payment would constitute a hardship, as determined by the city manager pursuant to objective guidelines developed in conjunction with the city attorney) may elect to pay such tax (excluding the administrative fee) in four equal quarterly installments, each such installment to be due and payable on the first working day of the first month of the calendar quarter to which such quarterly installment applies; provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph E shall not apply to any tax payable according to the provisions of paragraphs G and H of this Section 5.04.220. If any such person first conducts business in the Town after the beginning of the second calendar quarter of the tax year, such person may elect to pay the business tax (excluding the administrative fee) applicable to such tax year in four equal installments spread over the balance of the tax year in a similar manner as determined by the business tax collector. 
F.  Any other provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any person subject to the provisions of this chapter whose total annual business tax (excluding the administrative fee) exceeds $1,000 and whose business historically experiences substantial and unpredictable fluctuations from year to year in the amount of annual gross receipts (pursuant to objective guidelines to be developed by the city manager in conjunction with the city attorney) may, in addition to paying the business tax in quarterly installments as set forth in subparagraph E of this Section 5.04.220, estimate and pay the amount of each such quarterly installment as hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph F shall not apply to any tax payable according to the provisions of paragraphs G and H of this Section 5.04.220. At the end of each quarter, such person shall list the jobs which such person has begun during such quarter (hereinafter "applicable quarter") and the total value (total bid price plus any applicable modifications) of all such jobs (hereinafter "quarterly gross receipts"). The business tax installment due for the applicable quarter (payable at the beginning of the immediately succeeding quarter) shall be the amount of tax as set forth in paragraph A of Section 5.04.350 calculated on the quarterly gross receipts of such applicable quarter. At the end of the tax year, such person shall pay the total annual business tax due for such tax year (based on such person's actual annual Gross Receipts for such year), less the amounts paid as the first, second, and third quarterly installments hereunder. If the total paid for the first, second, and third quarterly installments does not equal or exceed 80% of the business tax determined to be due on the actual Gross Receipts for such three quarters, such person shall be liable for a penalty in the amount of 10% of the balance of the business tax determined to be due as hereinabove set forth. 
G.  The tax collectible pursuant to paragraph A of Section 5.04.350 of this chapter on that portion of a person's Gross Receipts which is attributable to business activity for which a building or other permit listing the value of such business activity is issued by the Town shall be paid by such person at the time such permit is applied for. The value of the business activity as set forth on such permit application shall establish the amount of Gross Receipts against which the applicable tax rate as set forth in paragraph A of Section 5.04.350 shall be applied. 
H.  Any other provision of this Chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, the collection of the business tax and administrative fee set forth in Section 5.04.350, subsections A and B, from persons conducting Category E businesses in the Town shall be accomplished as follows: 
1.  For fiscal year 85-86: 
a.  The San Mateo-Burlingame Board of Realtors shall be the agent of the Town for purposes of collecting the administrative fee from persons conducting Category E businesses in the Town. For purposes of facilitating the administration of the Business Tax, $10,000 shall be deemed to be an accurate and fair approximation of the total annual amount which would have been collected had the administrative fee been collected separately from each brokerage firm and each individual broker not included in a brokerage firm. Accordingly the payment by the Board of Realtors of such $10,000 amount to the Town for fiscal year 85-86 (received by the Town on June 20, 1986) constitutes payment in full for Category E Businesses' administrative fees for such fiscal year. The San Mateo-Burlingame Board of Realtors and the brokerage firms and individual brokers who would have otherwise been required pursuant to this Chapter to pay the fiscal year 85-86 administrative fee directly to the Town may establish whatever accounting procedures between themselves they deem appropriate with respect to such payment by the Board of Realtors. 
b.  The Town shall collect the business taxes owned by persons conducting such Category E businesses directly from such persons according to information provided to the Town by the San Mateo-Burlingame Board of Realtors specifying the appropriate persons and amounts to be billed by the Town pursuant to this paragraph. 
2.  For fiscal year 86-87 and thereafter: 
a.  The Town shall collect the administrative fee from persons conducting Category E businesses in the Town directly from such persons. 
b.  The business tax shall be collectible as set forth in subsection A of Section 5.04.350 as amended by Ordinance 426 adopted May 12, 1986. 
3.  No penalties for violation or penalties for delinquency as set forth in this chapter (as in effect prior to the passage of Ordinance 426 and this ordinance) shall be imposed upon persons conducting Category E businesses in the town for failure to obtain a Fiscal Year 1985-86 business license or to pay administrative fees or business taxes for Fiscal Year 1985-86 if such persons pay on or before August 31, 1986, the business taxes billed to them by the town pursuant to subsection H.1.b of Section 5.04.220. 
I.  For purposes of tax year 1985-86 only any tax set forth in paragraph A of Section 5.04.350 which would otherwise be due and payable prior to Monday, September 2, 1985, under the terms of this chapter shall instead be due and payable Monday, September, 1985, and shall be delinquent if not paid on or before such date. Any such tax which is due and payable on or after Monday, September 2, 1985, under the terms of this chapter shall be due and payable as so provided and shall not be subject to any special procedures for tax year 1985-86. The administrative fee set forth in paragraph B of Section 5.04.350 shall in all events be due and payable as set forth in paragraph C of this section 5.04.220. 
(Ord. 428, 1986; Ord. 411, 1985) 
5.04.230 - Penalties for delinquency. 
A.  In the event a business which had a business license in the immediately preceding year (whether pursuant to the ordinance codified in this section or to a predecessor ordinance) and which continues to conduct business in the town after the start of a new tax year fails to renew its business license for such new tax year and to pay the administrative fee and the business tax, if any, on or before the due date(s) as set forth in Section 5.04.220, a delinquency penalty of two hundred dollars plus fifty percent of the amount of total annual tax due plus one and one-half percent per month of the amount of tax due shall be imposed. 
B.  In the event that a person commences business in the town without first obtaining a business license and paying the administrative fee and the business tax, if any, a delinquency penalty of two hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the amount of total annual tax due plus one and one-half percent per month of the amount of tax due shall be imposed on said person, commencing on the date that the person first conducts business in the town. 
C.  If the business tax collector has knowledge of a person conducting business in the town without a valid current business license, the business tax collector shall cause a reminder notice to be sent to said person advising him of the requirements of this chapter. A person's obligation to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall not be conditioned upon the dispatch or receipt of said notice however.

    In addition to all other powers conferred upon him, the business tax collector shall have the power, for good cause shown, to extend the time for filing any required sworn statement or application for a period not to exceed thirty days, and in said case, to waive any delinquency penalty that would otherwise have accrued. 
(Ord. 411, 1985)

5.12.160 - Information to be confidential. 
    Information received by the police department pursuant to this chapter shall be kept confidential and shall not be made available to the public. The city council specifically finds that the public interest in not making such information public clearly outweighs the public interest that would be served by disclosing such information.

The conviction or punishment of any person for violation of any provision of this chapter shall not relieve such person from paying any permit fee or false alarm service charge then due and unpaid, nor shall payment of any permit fee or false alarm service charge prevent criminal or civil prosecution for violation of any provision of this chapter. All remedies shall be cumulative and the use of one or more remedies by the town shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The amount of any permit fee or false alarm service charge shall be deemed a debt to the town and may be collected by the town in any lawful manner. An action may be commenced in the name of the town in any court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of any delinquent permit fee or false alarm service charge. 
C.  All permit fees and false alarm service charges shall be deemed delinquent thirty days after they are due and payable, except as may otherwise be provided in the policies and procedures established pursuant to Section 5.12.110 for false alarm notices and false alarm service charges. 
(Ord. 604 § 22 (part), 1999) 
5.12.180 - False alarms prohibited. 
    No individual shall turn in a false alarm or cause a false alarm to be turned in. It shall not be deemed a false alarm if an individual activates a home alarm system in the reasonable belief (1) that an unlawful act is in progress or is imminent and that such unlawful act may result in great bodily harm or significant property damage or may involve an unauthorized entry onto any real property or into any improvement on such real property, or (2) that a life-threatening medical problem exists. Turning in a false alarm or causing a false alarm to be turned in may constitute filing a false police report and may subject the individual to the statutory penalties therefor, in addition to any other applicable penalties or remedies under this chapter or as otherwise provided by law. When not constituting the filing of a false police report, violation of this section shall be an infraction, punishable as set forth in Chapter 1.08 of this code. 
(Ord. 604 § 22 (part), 1999) 
5.12.190 - Violation-Penalty. 
    Except as otherwise set forth in this chapter, violation of any provision of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor punishable as set forth in Chapter 1.08.

Chapter 5.16 - FUNDRAISING EVENTS* 
Sections: 

5.16.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the holding of fundraising events so as to avoid or minimize (1) traffic, parking and public safety problems relating to the events; (2) disturbance or inconvenience to the neighbors and the neighborhoods where the fundraising events will take place; and (3) any other adverse consequences to the public health, safety or welfare resulting from holding the events. 
(Ord. 603 § 1 (part), 1999) 
5.16.020 - Definitions. 
A.  An "event" is an activity sponsored by one or more organizations, individuals, or other entities, held on one or more days at one or more locations within the town of Hillsborough to which the general public or more than thirty individuals are invited (except that in the case of an activity within the town sponsored by a public or private elementary, middle, or high school located within the town "seventy-five" shall be substituted for "thirty" in the above definition). 
B.  "Fundraising" means raising funds (1) for the benefit of an organization or entity with tax exempt status under section 501(c)(3), (4), or (5) of the Internal Revenue Code, or successor section, (2) for the benefit of any public or private school or any private club having an established, nonresidential location in town, or (3) for a candidate for public office, for a political party or other political organization, or to support or oppose a ballot measure. 
C.  "Political fundraising" means the fundraising described in subsection B(3) of this section. 
D.  Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, a "fundraising event" shall not include fundraisers held by a public or private school on the school's own grounds that are primarily aimed at and for the most part involve only the school's own community (e.g., the school's students and the students' family members, the school's teachers and other staff). Examples of the kinds of events intended to be excluded by this subsection from the permit requirements of this chapter are bake sales, pancake breakfasts, canned goods drives, toy collections, hot lunches, book fairs, school dances, script sales, jog-a-thons, theatrical events (plays, concerts, dances, choral performances), T-shirt sales, collections for national and international relief efforts, sales of produce raised on school grounds, and computer fairs. 
    The key elements of the fundraisers intended to be excluded by this subsection from the permit requirements of this chapter are that the fundraisers have little or no impact on parking and traffic outside of the school grounds and are generally integrated into the day-to-day school schedule and are generally part of the traditional school experience. 
    The fundraisers excluded by this subsection from the permit requirements of this chapter contrast with major fundraisers designed to attract the attendance of significant numbers of the public at large, i.e., outside the school's own community, instead of or in addition to attendance by family members of school students, and raise substantial funds for the school. Such major fundraisers typically are organized and conducted by adults and not by the students themselves and are not part of the day-to-day school schedule and experience. Such major fundraisers are subject to the permit requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. 603 § 1 (part), 1999) 
5.16.030 - Permit required. 
A.  Subject to the provisions of subsection B of this section, it is unlawful for any person, organization, society, association, corporation, or any agent or representative thereof, (hereafter "applicant") to hold a fundraising event in any residence, private school, private club, or public building or place, including, without limitation, public streets or rights-of-way in the town, (but not including public school grounds) unless the applicant has first obtained a permit for such event under this chapter. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, except for the requirement to pay for the services provided by the Hillsborough police department and Central County Fire, as set forth in Sections 5.16.040(C) and (D) of this chapter, and to provide the information described in Section 5.16.040(E) of this chapter, as applicable to the particular event, to the Hillsborough police department and Central County Fire, this chapter shall not apply to any fundraising event involving the services of the United States Secret Service or the services of counterpart federal, state or local law enforcement agencies providing security services to elected officials or foreign dignitaries. 
(Ord. 661 § 9 (part), 2005; Ord. 603 § 1 (part), 1999) 
5.16.040 - Application for permit.

A traffic permit (at no additional cost) from the Hillsborough police department is also required);

In determining whether or not an animal shall be declared dangerous, the animal control officer, peace officer or hearing officer appointed pursuant to Section 6.28.041 of this chapter, may consider, as a mitigating factor or factors, whether, at the time of the injury, attack or molestation, the person or animal suffering the injury, attack or molestation: 
1.  Provoked, tormented, teased, abused or assaulted the animal thereby causing or contributing to the alleged behavior; 
2.  Committed a wilful trespass or other tort upon the private property of the owner or caretaker of the animal;

In that event, the county director of the environmental services agency or the city having jurisdiction may allow the dangerous animal permit to be issued without a hearing. Unless a dangerous animal permit is immediately obtained, the animal shall be impounded at the owner's expense pending appropriate disposition as determined by the animal control officer and/or peace officer.

K.  The owner may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such animal to another county or city without notifying animal control at least twenty-four hours before such sale, transfer or disposal. Animal control will notify the proper authorities of the jurisdiction to which the dangerous animal is transferred. Should the owner of a dangerous animal wish to transfer ownership of the animal to another individual within San Mateo County, the new owner shall submit to a property inspection, apply for and obtain a new dangerous animal permit, pay all requisite fees, and comply with all provisions of this title and the requirements of the permit. 
L.  No more than two dangerous animals may be kept at any one household.

Chapter 8.10 - CHLOROFLUOROCARBON-PROCESSED FOOD PACKAGING 
Sections: 

8.10.010 - Findings and purpose. 
    The city council finds and declares as follows: 
(a)  Available scientific evidence indicates a strong probability that the family of substances known as chlorofluorocarbons ("CFCs"), when discharged into the atmosphere, degrades the earth's protective layer of ozone, allowing increased amounts of ultraviolet radiation to penetrate the atmosphere, posing an acute and immediate danger to human health, life, and the environment. Available scientific evidence indicates the strong possibility that the resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation may already have caused an increase in the incidence of skin cancers and other serious illnesses. 
(b)  One source of the CFCs currently being released into the atmosphere is the use of these substances as blowing agents in the manufacture of some of the polystyrene foam packaging products used in the food services industry. There are substitutes for these products currently available which do not use CFCs in their manufacture. 
(c)  The Town of Hillsborough supports international, federal, and state bans on all uses of CFCs not deemed absolutely essential. Until such policies become law, responsible action to reduce release of CFCs into the atmosphere, and to increase the public awareness of the danger posed by the use of these substances, must be undertaken at the local level. 
(d)  It is the intent of the City Council to reduce the amount of CFC-processed food packaging products purchased and used within and by the Town and residents of Hillsborough in order to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the health hazards created by the release of CFCs into the atmosphere. 
8.10.020 - Definitions. 
    The following words and phrases, whenever used in this chapter, shall be construed as defined in this section:

(e)  "Prepared food" means beverages and foods which are prepared on the retail food vendor's restaurant's premises by cooking, chopping, slicing, mixing, freezing, squeezing, or otherwise, or which are received by the retail food vendor or restaurant already having been so prepared and which are made available to customers by the retail food vendor or restaurant, and which require no further preparation to be consumed. "Prepared food" does not include any raw uncooked meat product which requires further preparation to be consumed and does not include raw uncooked fruits or vegetables which are not chopped, squeezed, mixed, or otherwise processed in some fashion. 
(f)  "Restaurant" means any establishment or activity, including, but not limited to, school lunch rooms or cafeterias, private clubs, and charitable fund raising events, located within the Town of Hillsborough, selling prepared food to be eaten on or about the restaurant's premises by customers. 
(g)  "Retail food vendor" means any caterer who serves food within the Town, lunch truck, or other business other than a restaurant, located in or doing business in the Town of Hillsborough which provides or sells takeout food.

8.10.040 - Town purchases of chlorofluorocarbon-processed food packaging prohibited. 
    The Town of Hillsborough shall not purchase any CFC-processed food packaging. 
8.10.050 - Food packaging, proof of compliance. 
(a)  Every restaurant and every retail food vendor shall show proof of compliance with Section 8.10.030 of this code by one of the following means: (1) entering into a contract with its suppliers, which provides that the supplier will supply only food packaging not manufactured with CFCs, or (2) obtaining a written statement from its suppliers, which provides that the supplier will supply only food packaging not manufactured with CFCs, or (3) obtaining a written statement from the supplier on each invoice for food packaging that the food packaging invoiced was not CFC-processed.

The expenses of abating any such public nuisance and (to the extent allowed by law) the amount of any applicable unpaid administrative fines, less any money received from any salvage value as provided in this chapter, shall be a personal obligation of the property owner(s) and a special assessment and lien against the real property upon which the public nuisance has been abated, and the amount thereof shall be added to the next succeeding tax bill against such property, and shall be collectible at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and procedure in case of delinquency, including, but not limited to, sale after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments, except as may otherwise by provided by law.

Such a notice shall contain as much as possible of the information required by Section 8.16.050(C) in a notice for a hearing before the city manager, or his designated representative. 
C.  Whenever the city manager, or his designated representative, reasonably believes that the condition of a property places another property or its contents in jeopardy due to vandalism, thievery or imminent hazard and the city manager, or his designated representative, is unable to communicate with an owner of the property, an authorized agent of the owner(s) or an occupant after reasonable efforts, the city manager, or his designated representative, may take such steps as he believes are necessary to secure the premises and remove or reduce the immediate or imminent hazard posed until a property owner can be contacted. 
D.

(Ord. 557 § 15 (part), 1997) 
8.16.160 - Civil or criminal actions not affected. 
    Any abatement process undertaken pursuant to this chapter shall not prejudice or adversely affect any other action, civil or criminal, that may be brought to abate a public nuisance or violation or to seek compensation for damages suffered. A civil or criminal action may be brought concurrently with any other abatement process regarding the same public nuisance or violation. At the discretion of the prosecuting attorney, any action brought to abate a public nuisance or violation caused by a non-owner occupant of property or to seek compensation for damages may also include as a party the owner of the real property that is the site of the use or activity causing the nuisance. It is the express intention of this section to permit the prosecution of real property owners who fail to take reasonable steps after notice to correct nuisances or violations existing on their property even though the property may be leased to others.

Chapter 8.18 - GRAFFITI 
Sections: 

8.18.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this Chapter is to prevent and control the spread of graffiti in the Town and to provide a program for removal of graffiti from walls and structures on both public and private property in a timely manner. The City Council hereby adopts this Chapter pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.3 which authorizes cities to use public funds to remove graffiti or other inscribed material from public and private property. 
(Ord. 532, 01/10/94) 
8.18.020 - Graffiti declared a public nuisance. 
    Graffiti on public or private property is a blighting factor which both depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such vandalism and also depreciates the value of adjacent and surrounding properties. In so doing, graffiti has a negative impact upon the entire community. 
    Further, the existence of graffiti tends to encourage other acts of malicious vandalism and may breed community discontent leading to other forms of criminal activity. The Council finds and determines that the graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance and that, unless it is removed expeditiously from public and private property, it tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the result that entire neighborhoods are affected and the entire community depreciates in value and becomes a less desirable place to live. 
(Ord. 532, 01/10/94) 
8.18.030 - Definitions. 
(a)  "Graffiti" means any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, or design that is marked, drawn, etched, scratched, painted, or applied, using any substance, material, means, or instrument, on any structural component (or any other part) of any public or private building, structure, or other facility, regardless of the nature of the material of that structural component or other part. 
(b)  "Obnoxious graffiti" means having any of the following characteristics: 
(1)  Being insulting or threatening to, or inciting hatred of or contempt for, any racial, religious or ethnic group, any other identifiable group, or any identifiable individual; 
(2)  Including or referring to the name of any gang or gang-like group or including words or symbols associated with any gang or gang-like group; 
(3)  Containing obscene or indecent language or pictures; 
(4)  Constituting an eyesore (defined as "offensive to view") to the neighborhood or tending to attract more graffiti. 
(Ord. 532, 01/10/94) 
8.18.040 - Graffiti prohibited. 
(a)  It is unlawful for any person to apply graffiti on any public or privately owned permanent structure located on public or privately owned real property within the Town. 
(b)  It is unlawful for the owner, occupant, manager, or other person in control of a lot or parcel of real property within the Town to permit obnoxious graffiti to remain upon such lot or parcel or upon any permanent structure located on such lot or parcel for a period in excess of those prescribed in this Chapter. 
(Ord. 532, 01/10/94) 
8.18.050 - Removal of graffiti by Town; Consents. 
(a)  Whenever graffiti located on public or privately owned permanent structures, or on public or privately owned real property within the Town, which is visible either from any public right of way or from any other public or private property, the Chief of Police of the Town or his or her designee is authorized to provide for the removal of the graffiti in accordance with state law and established Town procedures. Such action by the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall be deemed to be the "finding" required by Government Code § 53069.3 that the graffiti in question is obnoxious. All references to graffiti hereafter in this Section shall be deemed to be to graffiti which has been "found" to be obnoxious as described above. 
(b)  The Town shall remove graffiti found on Town property as soon as practical. 
(c)  The Town shall remove graffiti found on property owned by a public entity other than the Town after the Town has secured consent from the public agency having jurisdiction over the structure or real property on which the graffiti is located. The removal shall be at no cost to such public entity. 
(d)  Regarding graffiti on property owned by a public utility (for example, PG&E), the Town shall promptly notify the public utility by telephone that the graffiti exists and must be promptly removed by the public utility at the public utility's expense. The Town and the public utility shall agree on a deadline for removal not to exceed three (3) calendar days after the telephone notification. 
(e)  (i)  Regarding graffiti on private property not described in subparagraph (d), the Town shall conspicuously post on the property a written notice stating that the graffiti exists and must be removed by the owner, occupant, manager, or other person in control of the property by the end of the second business day following the date of posting. The same notice shall be mailed by the Town to the owner of record of the property. The notice shall note the date of posting and mailing and shall state that failure to comply will cause the Town to enter the property and clean off, paint over, or otherwise remove the graffiti at Town expense. 
(ii)  The owner, occupant, manager, or other person in control of the property may file a written objection by the end of the second business day following the date of posting and mailing of the notice, objecting to the removal of graffiti by the Town. The posted and mailed notice shall explain the procedure and deadline for filing a written objection. 
(iii)  If the property is occupied by other than the owner of record, the occupant, manager, or other person in control of the property shall immediately contact the owner and verify that the owner is aware of the notice and its contents. The posted notice shall direct that this be done. 
(iv)  Failure of the owner, occupant, manager or other person in control of the property to file a written objection to the removal of graffiti by the Town by the end of the second business day following the date of posting and mailing of the notice shall be conclusively presumed to be consent by the owner, occupant, manager, or other person in control of the property to the Town's entering the property and removing the graffiti. 
(v)  If the graffiti is not removed and no objection is filed, the Town may enter the property and remove the graffiti at no cost to the property owners.

    In the event that the owner, occupant, manager, or other person in control of a property where graffiti has been found files a written objection under Section 8.18.050(e)(ii), the owner, occupant, manager, or other person in control of the property shall remove the graffiti at private expense within forty-eight (48) hours after filing such written objection. 
(Ord. 536, 03/14/94; Ord. 532, 01/10/94) 
8.18.070 - Removal of graffiti by abatement process. 
    In the event that the owner, occupant, manager, or other person in control of a property where graffiti has been found files a written objection under Section 8.18.050(e)(ii) and then fails to remove the graffiti within the forty-eight hour period specified in Section 8.18.060, the town may proceed to abate the graffiti as a public nuisance at private expense pursuant to the nuisance abatement process provided in Chapter 8.16 of Title 8 of the Hillsborough Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 536, 1994; Ord. 532 (part), 1994)

If the violator is a minor, the parents or guardian of the violator shall be responsible for such reimbursement.

(Ord. 532 (part), 1994) 
Chapter 8.20 - PUBLIC EVENTS

    In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles as public nuisances, the city council of the town makes the following findings and declarations. The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles on private or public property including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, on private or public property including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord 615 § 1,3, 2001; Ord. 518, 1993, Ord. 320 § 1, 1972: prior code § 50.22.20 (part))

B.  The fact that a vehicle described in subsection (A) above is excepted from being deemed a nuisance under this chapter of the Hillsborough Municipal Code or under Chapter 10 of Division 11 of the California Vehicle Code, on which this chapter is based, shall not be deemed to prevent such vehicle from being found to be a nuisance under any other applicable provision of Hillsborough or California or other law.

Chapter 8.28 - VOLUNTARY RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES REGARDING TREES AND VIEWS 
Sections: 

8.28.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  In enacting this chapter, the city council desires to provide a mechanism for resolving disputes between owners of adjoining properties within the town concerning the obstruction of views or the obstruction of sunlight caused by the growth of trees, shrubs or other vegetation. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by providing a means to resolve disputes regarding trees and views in order to preserve peace between neighbors and to preserve the property values and quality of life in the town. 
B.  The city council finds that the character and beauty of the town and the enjoyment and value of real property therein is dependent in part upon preserving views and access to sunlight and at the same time upon preserving the scenic beauty and environmental protections afforded by trees, shrubs and other vegetation. The city council further finds that the trees within the town contribute importantly to the privacy and serenity valued by the inhabitants of the town. Thus, the intent of this chapter is not to diminish the number or variety of trees in the town or the privacy afforded by them, but rather to preserve, where possible, conditions as they existed at the time the owners in question purchased their property. That is, if a view existed at the time the property owner purchased the property in question ("time of purchase"), that view is to be preserved to the extent practical, from subsequent encroachment by trees and other vegetation. If, however, at the time of purchase, trees or other vegetation already existed in the location complained of and at roughly the height or mass complained of, then such trees or vegetation are not required by this chapter to be removed or reduced to create or improve a view beyond the state of such view at the time of purchase. 
(Ord. 606 § 2 (part), 2000: Ord. 406 § 1 (part), 1985) 
8.28.020 - Unreasonable obstruction prohibited-Definitions of certain terms. 
    No tree, shrub or other vegetation shall be planted, maintained or permitted to grow upon any parcel of property in the town in such manner as to obstruct unreasonably the view from, or the sunlight reaching, any other adjoining parcel of property. The term "adjoining parcel" shall include any parcel located directly across the street from the parcel in question. One parcel shall be "directly" across the street from another if a line drawn perpendicular to any point along the common boundary of either parcel and the street shall intersect any point along the common boundary of the other parcel and the same street. The term "unreasonably," as used in this section, means that the detriment to the adversely affected parcel caused by such growth is greater than the benefit of such growth to the parcel upon which it is located. The view from or sunlight reaching a parcel shall not necessarily be deemed to be unreasonably obstructed merely because it is not completely unimpeded. 
(Ord. 606 § 2 (part), 2000: Ord. 406 § 1 (part), 1985) 
8.28.030 - Complaint. 
    Any property owner (hereinafter "complainant") who believes that the view from or sunlight reaching his property is being unreasonably obstructed, as defined in Section 8.28.020, shall contact the owner of the parcel upon which such obstruction is situated and attempt to resolve the problem. 
(Ord. 606 §§ 2 (part), 3, 2000: Ord. 406 § 1 (part), 1985) 
8.28.040 - Complaints concerning town property. 
    If the obstructing growth is on the town's property, the city manager shall determine whether the growth merits pruning, removal or other treatment and, within ten days after receipt of the complaint, the city manager shall notify the complainant in writing, by ordinary mail or personal delivery, of such determination. If the city manager's determination is that pruning, removal or other treatment is appropriate, the city manager shall so inform the complainant as set forth above and shall authorize the performance of such work. 
(Ord. 606 §§ 2 (part), 4, 2000: Ord. 406 § 1 (part), 1985) 
8.28.050 - Costs of correction. 
    All work required to correct any obstruction, and associated cleanup work, shall be performed at the cost of complainant. 
(Ord. 606 §§ 2 (part), 5, 2000: Ord. 406 § 1 (part), 1985) 
8.28.060 - Voluntary mediation and arbitration. 
    If the persons subject to the provisions of this chapter cannot resolve any dispute governed by this chapter on an informal basis, the complainant may offer voluntary mediation to the other party. Should mediation fail or be declined by the other party, the complainant may present the other party with a written claim and offer of voluntary binding arbitration within thirty days. If the other party declines such arbitration, then civil action may be pursued by the complainant to resolve the dispute. 
(Ord. 606 §§ 2 (part), 6, 2000: Ord. 429, 1986) 
8.28.070 - Compliance with other laws. 
    All other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, any agreement reached by the parties to the dispute, including any mediated settlement, and any decision by the arbitrator shall be consistent with the requirements of this code, California statutes and all other laws and regulations with respect to the prohibition, prevention, and removal of encroachments and obstructions on public ways and city streets and to the regulation of planting trees along city streets.

Chapter 8.40 - TOBACCO SMOKING REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

8.40.010 - Findings and purpose. 
    The town council of the town of Hillsborough does find that: 
A.  Numerous scientific studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor pollution; 
B.  Reliable scientific studies, including studies by the Surgeon General of the United States and studies commissioned and assessed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers; particularly to children and teens, elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; 
C.  Health hazards induced by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke include lung and other forms of cancer, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, decreased exercise tolerance, broncho-constriction and broncho-spasm, and that the most common cause of premature death from environmental tobacco smoke is heart disease; 
D.  Reliable scientific studies assessed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have found that sidestream and secondhand tobacco smoke causes the death of at least fifty-three thousand nonsmokers annually and is a leading cause of premature death and disability among nonsmokers; 
E.  Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand tobacco smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to same; 
F.  Persons, particularly employees, have a right to a smoke-free environment if they desire; 
G.  Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of fires. In addition, cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures cause economic losses to businesses; 
H.  Substantial scientific evidence exists that the direct use of tobacco products causes cancer, heart disease, and various other medical diseases. The Surgeon General of the U.S. has found that tobacco-caused diseases are the leading cause of premature, preventable death and disability in the U.S.; 
I.  The National Centers for Disease Control have found that at least four hundred thirty-four thousand Americans die each year from tobacco-caused diseases. The Surgeon General of the U.S. and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have found that a majority of those Americans who die of tobacco-caused diseases became addicted to nicotine in tobacco products as adolescents before the age of legal consent; 
J.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse has concluded that the nicotine in tobacco products is a powerful addictive drug and identifies nicotine addiction as the most widespread example of drug dependence in the U.S.; and 
K.  The Surgeon General of the U.S. has found that nicotine in tobacco products is as addictive as cocaine and heroin; 
L.  E-cigarettes are battery operated devices that generally use liquid cartridges filled with nicotine, flavors, and other chemicals. E-cigarettes convert liquid nicotine, which is a known neuro-toxin and highly addictive substance, into chemically impregnated gas that is inhaled by a user simulating smoking; and 
M.  Some e-cigarette cartridges claim not to contain nicotine, but there is no regulatory program to monitor this assertion and no way for the town to determine which cartridges may or may not contain nicotine. 
    Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this chapter are: 
 To protect public health, safety, and general welfare by prohibiting the use of tobacco products and e-cigarettes in enclosed areas in the Town of Hillsborough which are owned or leased by the town or otherwise used by the Town of Hillsborough; and 
 To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe tobacco smoke-free air and to recognize that the need to breathe tobacco smoke-free air has priority over the desire to smoke. 
    The city council further finds it is within its basic police power to implement and enforce the provisions of this section.

Chapter 9.76 - CURFEW* 
Sections:

E.  "Parent" means a person who is (1) a natural parent, adoptive parent or stepparent of another person; or (2) at least eighteen years of age and authorized by a parent or guardian to have the care and custody of a minor.

G.  "Remain" means to (1) linger or stay, whether on foot or in a vehicle; or (2) fail to leave premises when requested to do so by a police officer or the owner or person in control of the premises.

D.  In the event that a property owner fails to respond to the second notice within thirty days from the date of mailing (or such shorter time as set forth in subsection E of this section) or fails to have the required construction, repair or replacement completed by the deadline set forth in the notice(s) (which shall take into account the nature of the work needed, the urgency of the work, and the availability of workers to perform the work), the director of public works or the director's designee shall cause the construction or repair to be done. In such event, the cost thereof, including, but not limited to, all permit and any other administrative fees that would be been charged to the property owner or the owner's representative had the owner caused the construction or repair to be done, shall be assessed against the owner and referred to collection or recoverable in a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and the judgment of the court shall include costs and a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court. 
E.  The time periods in subsections C and D of this section may be shortened as necessary by the director of public works or the director's designee if a hazardous condition exists which requires prompt or immediate abatement in order to protect the public health, safety or welfare.

Such written approval shall not create nor imply an obligation to pay for work performed unless such obligation is specifically set forth therein, in which case the amount to be paid or donated for the service shall be specifically listed on the written approval. 
2.  Persons engaged in the painting of address numbers, symbols, legends or markings for profit or for charity shall, before advertising, soliciting or performing such work, comply with the provisions of all resolutions and ordinances of the town pertaining to such work. 
3.  Painted address numbers, symbols, legends or markings shall be painted with black paint, four inches in height, stenciled and centered on a reflective, white painted, rectangular background not to exceed fifteen inches in length by six inches in height. The paint used shall be standard, highway traffic quality, quick-drying paint meeting U.S. Department of Transportation standards. The address number shall be identical to the number assigned by the city engineer. 
4.  The provisions of this subsection G shall not apply to employees or contractors of the town or employees of public utilities or cable television corporations (as those terms are defined under the California Public Utilities Code) when such are engaged in marking the locations of the underground utilities, valve covers, above-ground valves, or the painting of restricted parking designations or other official traffic control devices as provided under the Hillsborough Municipal Code.

12.04.130 - Street preservation. 
A.  Any public street, or portion thereof, which has been constructed, reconstructed, or paved by town staff, under contract with the town or under permit, shall not be excavated or cut into if it has been overlaid with at least one inch of asphaltic concrete at any time during the five years prior to the request to excavate or cut into or has been overlaid with a slurry seal at any time during the two years prior to the request to excavate or cut into. 
B.  The city engineer may grant exemptions to the foregoing prohibition in order to facilitate development on adjacent properties, or to provide emergency repairs to subsurface facilities. When granting an exemption, conditions to mitigate the damage to the roadways and to ensure safe and structurally sound excavation shall be imposed by the town which may include surface grinding, sub-base repairs, asphaltic concrete overlays or slurry seals on full width and full block increments. The town reserves the right to specify additional conditions to ensure that the appearance of the work when completed shall not degrade from the appearance of the street on which the work is conducted and the surrounding area. All costs, not limited to plan review, construction inspection, material testing, bonding, and other town expenses incurred in connection therewith, shall be the responsibility of the party receiving the exemption. Receipt of the exemption shall not relieve the recipient from complying with the permit requirements of this chapter. 
C.  Should excavation work be planned within a public roadway section not covered by subsection A. above, the permittee shall be required to pay the Town a slurry seal in-lieu fee to cover the cost of a full roadway width slurry seal on that portion of the street affected by the permittee's excavation. This fee shall be updated yearly, approved by the city council and included in the schedule of fees and charges as included in the town's annual budget.

Chapter 12.08 - VISIBILITY* 
Sections: 

12.08.010 - Visibility. 
A.  Whenever any outdoor fixture (as defined in Section 12.12.010), hedge, shrubbery or tree, located on or growing in any street right-of-way or upon any private property significantly obstructs the view of any intersection or of any traffic upon the streets approaching such intersection and, in the good faith judgment of the director of public works or the director's designee, creates a safety hazard, the director of public works or the director's designee may require the owner of the outdoor fixture, hedge, shrubbery or tree promptly to modify the same to the extent necessary to remove the obstruction to the view. 
B.  For street intersections having a ninety degree angle or less (or any larger angle where nonetheless, in the good faith judgment of the director of public works or the director's designee, certain outdoor fixtures or vegetation would constitute a traffic hazard), no vegetation which can exceed two and one-half feet in height, at maturity, above existing grade at the property line or pavement grade of the street, whichever is higher, shall be planted or maintained in the triangular area, defined below (provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to certain types of trees of a certain size and spacing as set forth in a policy established by the director of public works or the director's designee setting forth the height, trunk diameter, spacing, type, and other specifications of trees which do not obstruct the view), and no outdoor fixture taller than two and one-half feet above existing grade at the property line or pavement grade of the street, whichever is higher, shall be located in the triangular area (provided, however, that the director of public works or the director's designee may except any specific outdoor fixture which does not, in fact, obstruct the view). The triangular area is that area bounded on two sides by forty feet of the property lines abutting the street, as measured from the intersection of the property lines, and on the third side by a line connecting the property lines at points forty feet from their intersection, as illustrated in the following diagram: 

C.  Subject to the provisions of subsection B of this section, which shall control in the event of a conflict between that paragraph and this one, no hedge shall be maintained at a height greater than four feet if the hedge is twenty-five feet or less from the center line of the street; provided, however, that any hedge so located which was higher than four feet as of December 1998 may be maintained at its existing height until such time, if ever, as the hedge is reduced to below four feet, in which case the hedge shall thereafter be limited to a maximum height of four feet. 
D.  Whenever, in the good faith judgment of the director of public works or the director's designee, any material, plantings, shrubs, fences, walls, hedges, trees, vines, clippings, trimmings, or similar items (which are attached to, installed, constructed, planted, grown, stored, stacked or piled around, near, in front of or adjacent to any public fire hydrant, directional sign, regulatory or warning sign, catch basin, spillway, culvert or other public object) obstruct the view or clear visibility of or interfere in any manner with the primary purpose of such public fire hydrant, directional sign, regulatory or warning sign, catch basin, spillway, culvert or other public object, the director of public works or the director's designee may require the owner of the material, plantings, shrubs, fences, walls, hedges, trees, vines, clippings, trimmings, or similar items promptly to modify the same to the extent necessary to remove the obstruction or interference.

C.  The city engineer or the city engineer's designee shall set the application for public hearing before the city council and shall give notice of the hearing under the Type B notice procedure set forth in Chapter 1.20. The city council shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the application based on public health, safety and welfare needs and taking into account in that regard, the number and location of any other outdoor fixtures located within the right-of-way in the vicinity of the proposed outdoor fixture, the likelihood of the town's need for access to the affected portion of the right-of-way, the effect that allowing the outdoor fixture within the right-of-way would have on parking and on traffic safety (traffic meaning motor vehicles, self-propelled vehicles and pedestrians), and any other factors that the council deems relevant to a determination of the public health, safety, and welfare needs. 
D.  In the event that the city council approves or conditionally approves the application, the applicant shall execute and record an agreement regarding revocable permit (if one has not previously been recorded for the outdoor fixture) setting forth the circumstances under which the applicant shall be required to remove the outdoor fixture from the right-of-way.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 725, § 2, adopted June 8, 2015, amended chapter 13.16 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former chapter 13.16, §§ 13.16.010-13.16.060, pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

13.16.010 - Findings and determinations. 
    The city council of the town finds and determines that: 
A.  The state of California and the town received average precipitation during winter 2015-2016 which somewhat alleviated but did not end drought conditions; 
B.  On January 17, 2014, the governor issued a proclamation of a state of emergency under the California Emergency Services Act based on drought conditions; 
C.  On April 25, 2014, the governor issued a proclamation of a continued state of emergency under the California Emergency Services Act based on continued drought conditions; 
D.  On April 1, 2015, the governor issued an executive order that, in part, directs the state water resources control board (water board) to impose restrictions on water suppliers to achieve a statewide 25 percent reduction in potable urban usage from June 1, 2015, through February 29, 2016 (compliance period); 
E.  On May 5, 2015, the state water board adopted Resolution No. 2015-0032, an emergency regulation for statewide urban water conservation that requires urban water suppliers to reduce water use, effective June 1, 2015; 
F.  Based on monthly water use reports submitted to the state water board by Hillsborough beginning in June 2014, the state water resources control board found Hillsborough's residential water use to be three hundred twenty-four and a half gallons per capita per day; 
G.  Per Resolution No. 2015-0032, the town was required to reduce its total potable water production by thirty-six percent during the compliance period as compared to the amount used in the same time period in 2013 ("reduction requirement"); 
H.  On May 9, 2016, Governor Brown's Executive Order B-37-19 directed state agencies to update temporary emergency water restrictions, such as State Water Board Resolution No. 2015-0032 which had imposed a thirty-six percent mandatory water use reduction on Hillsborough, and transition to permanent, long-term improvement in water use; 
I.  On May 18, 2016, the state water board adopted Resolution No. 2016-0029, which established a framework for wholesale and urban water suppliers to self-certify water supply, demand and conservation standards through Water Year 2019, the result of which is that the town is no longer subject to the reduction requirement; 
J.  On May 26, 2016, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) also requested that all of its customers participate in a system-wide, voluntary, ten percent reduction of water use as compared to 2013 in order to maintain drought readiness, should persistent drought conditions return; 
K.  By June 15, 2016, the SFPUC, which is Hillsborough's sole wholesale water supplier, using the state's resolution methodology, certified that the Hetch Hetchy water system had sufficient supply to meet customer demand through 2019, in the event of three more consecutive drought years; 
L.  The state water board can issue informational orders, conservation orders or cease and desist orders to the town for failure to meet the State Water Board Resolution No. 2016-0029 requirements, and violation of a cease and desist order is subject to a civil liability of up to ten thousand dollars a day; and 
M.  The rules, regulations and prohibitions set forth herein are intended to conserve water for the town for the greatest public benefit with particular regard to indoor domestic use, sanitation and fire protection. 
(Ord. No. 725, § 2, 6-8-2015; Ord. No. 737, § 1, 6-13-2016; Ord. No. 740, § 1, 7-11-2016) 
13.16.020 - Definitions. 
A.  "Town" means the Town of Hillsborough. 
B.  "City council" means the city council of the Town of Hillsborough. 
C.  "Customer" means the owner(s) and any person, individual, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, organization, or governmental or other entity, whether within or without the geographic boundaries of the Town of Hillsborough, who uses water supplied by the Town of Hillsborough. 
D.  "Total potable water production" means all potable water that enters into the town's distribution system, excluding water placed into storage and not withdrawn for use during the reporting period or water exported outside the town's area. 
E.  "Water use" shall mean use of potable water delivered to a customer by the town through its water distribution system. 
F.  "Water unit" ("Unit") is one hundred cubic feet ("CCF") or seven hundred forty-eight gallons of water. 
(Ord. No. 725, § 2, 6-8-2015) 
13.16.030 - Water conservation. 
A.  All customers are urged and encouraged to conserve water in order that the town will meet the SFPUC 10 percent voluntary reduction requirement. 
B.  Customers are urged to use reclaimed water rather than town potable water for consolidation of backfill and other construction purposes. 
C.  Customers are urged to postpone pool, landscape and hot tub construction projects when mandatory rationing is in force, and all water used for the maintenance of new landscape and construction projects must be within the amount allotted when mandatory rationing is in force. 
D.  Customers are urged to postpone pool draining when mandatory rationing is in force. Alternatively, residents may fill the pool using water other than that from the town's potable water supply. 
E.  Customers are encouraged to consult with irrigation specialists and/or utilize water audits to obtain recommendations for optimizing indoor and outdoor water use and conservation. 
(Ord. No. 725, § 2, 6-8-2015; Ord. No. 736, § 1, 5-9-2016; Ord. No. 740, § 2, 7-11-2016) 
13.16.035 - Mandatory water conservation for new landscapes requiring a building permit. 
    Chapter 15.29 of the Hillsborough Municipal Code establishes mandatory outdoor water conservation measures for new construction and permitted, rehabilitated landscapes with irrigated areas greater than two thousand five hundred square feet. In the event of any inconsistency between Chapter 13.16 and Chapter 15.29, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. 
    Exceptions to landscape requirements within the Hillsborough Municipal Code may be granted by the director of building and planning on a case by case basis while this urgency ordinance is in effect, based upon the finding that implementation of required landscaping would result in a violation of this chapter. Exceptions must be applied for in writing to the director of building and planning prior to the required implementation time and include a water budget as outlined in Chapter 15.29. 
(Ord. No. 725, § 2, 6-8-2015) 
13.16.040 - Water rationing. 
    From and after June 1, 2015, through May 31, 2016, water use for each residential and non-residential parcel shall be limited to the water allotment for such parcel. From and after May 31, 2016, water use for residential and non-residential parcels shall no longer be limited to the water allotment for such parcels. Water allotments for properties provided water by the Hillsborough water department shall be determined by the following method: 
A.  For residential parcels, the sum of the following: 
1.  For individuals residing on the parcel for at least six months of the year: 
Thirty-six units per year per individual. 
2.  Outdoor water allotment will be determined as follows: 
Parcel Size Allotment 0 to 3 acres* y = 123 + 123x Greater than 3 acres Determined by water auditor as approved by the town public works director  
* See Section 13.16.030, F. 
where y = annual outdoor allotment in units (ccf) x = parcel size in acres (including fractions thereof)  
  
B.  For the purposes of determining indoor residential water allotments, the town will assume three individuals per residential parcel. Residents with more than three individuals residing at the parcel for at least six months of the year may have their indoor residential water allotments adjusted by submitting the request in writing in the form and format provided by the town and signing an affidavit stating the number of residents the applicant claims reside at the parcel for at least six months of the year. 
C.  Nonresidential parcels shall reduce water use in the same percentage as required by the town. Nonresidential parcels may, at their option and expense, have water allotments determined by a water auditor approved by the public works director. 
D.  The monthly distribution of the annual outdoor allotments will be adjusted to reflect average weather conditions defined as evapotranspiration minus effective rainfall for a period greater than ten years, based on local California Irrigation Management Information System weather data. This distribution will result in monthly water usage targets, a schedule of which will be provided by the town to each residential customer. 
E.  Parcel size shall be determined by the county assessor's database or by the legal description of the parcel in a deed recorded in the office of the county recorder of San Mateo County. 
(Ord. No. 725, § 2, 6-8-2015; Ord. No. 736, § 2, 5-9-2016; Ord. No. 737, § 2, 6-13-2016) 
13.16.050 - Penalty; enforcement. 
A.  A customer shall incur no penalty for water use during the period of October 1, 2015, through May 31, 2016. 
B.  For purposes of determining whether a penalty is incurred, and if so the amount thereof, a customer will be allowed to accumulate water usage for three consecutive monthly billing periods, commencing with the month of July 2015 (the "three month period") and again for the thirteen consecutive monthly billing periods commencing with the month of October 2015 (the "thirteen month period"). If the result of such accumulation is that water usage for the three month period is less than the target for such period, there shall be no penalty for the three month period. There shall be no penalty based solely upon water usage for the ensuing five month period. If the customer's water usage for the three month period is less than the target for such period (the "three month difference"), but the customer's usage for the thirteen month period exceeds the target for such period, then an amount equal to the three month difference shall be added to customer's target which would otherwise have applied to the thirteen month period. If the total water usage for the thirteen month period is less than the target for such period, there shall be no penalty for the thirteen month period. 
C.  Continued water use in excess of the applicable target after written notice ("enforcement notice") shall be cause for the town to either install a water flow restrictor at the water meter or disconnect water service to the customer until the customer is taking all measures necessary to bring his/her water usage for the subject parcel into compliance. In the event that the customer has, or requests the town to install, a separate meter providing outdoor water use exclusively, the town shall first restrict or disconnect such outdoor meter before restricting or disconnecting the meter providing indoor water use. A water flow restrictor removal charge or a water meter reconnection charge shall be billed to the customer as described in the town's schedule of fees and charges. 
D.  Continued water use in excess of the applicable target may also constitute a public nuisance subject to abatement as provided in Chapter 8.16 of the Municipal Code. 
(Ord. No. 725, § 2, 6-8-2015; Ord. No. 729, § 1, 10-12-2015; Ord. No. 735, § 1, 5-9-2016; Ord. No. 736 § 3, 5-9-2016; Ord. No. 737, § 3, 6-13-2016) 
13.16.060 - Appeals. 
    Customers desiring to contest an excess penalty charge, an enforcement action or an enforcement notice which proposes to install a restrictor or disconnect water service may file an appeal by completing a form provided by the town, which will be heard by the town's code enforcement panel, or such other body as may be appointed by the city council or, with the consent of the city council, by the city manager, which body or person shall have the authority to waive or reduce the penalty and/or modify the customer's allotment. An allotment not otherwise subject to modification by virtue of the application of Section 13.16.040, is nonetheless subject to possible modification based upon extenuating circumstances, including but not limited to the following: 
(a)  The customer has taken all reasonable steps to reduce water use; 
(b)  Failure to modify the allotment could result in the substantial loss of trees or other high value plants or the loss of landscaping of historic significance; 
(c)  There are temporary residents at the customer's residential parcel which do not meet the six-month requirement of Section 13.16.404B; and/or 
(d)  The subject residential parcel contains new landscaping not yet established. 
As a condition to filing the appeal, all outstanding water use charges, excluding any proposed penalty, must be paid in full. To the extent a penalty is upheld on appeal, it shall be paid within ten days after the customer is notified of the decision. 
(Ord. No. 725, § 2, 6-8-2015; Ord. No. 727, § 1, 9-15-2015) 
13.16.070 - Elimination of water waste. 
A.  The following activities are hereby prohibited and/or limited within the town: 
1.  The application of potable water to ornamental landscapes, grass, lawns, and turf shall be done in a manner that does not create excessive runoff onto adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, private and public walkways or roadways, driveways, parking lots or parking strips, or other hardscape. 
2.  The outdoor irrigation of ornamental landscapes, grass, lawns, and turf with potable water shall be limited to two days per week or otherwise limited in a manner designed to achieve a comparable reduction in water consumption when mandatory rationing is in force. 
3.  The irrigation of landscapes no earlier than one hour before sunset and no later than one hour after sunrise is strongly encouraged and shall not occur when mandatory rationing is in force. 
4.  Potable water shall not be applied to driveways, walkways, sidewalks, or parking strips, except where necessary to address an immediate health or safety need or to comply with a term or condition of a permit issued by a state or federal agency. 
5.  Potable water shall not be used in outdoor fountains or other decorative water features except where the water is part of a recirculating system. 
6.  The use of a hose that dispenses potable water to wash a motor vehicle is prohibited, except where the hose is fitted with a shut-off nozzle or device that causes it to cease dispensing water immediately when not in use. 
7.  The application of potable water to outdoor landscapes during and within forty-eight hours of measureable rainfall is strongly discouraged and shall not occur when mandatory rationing is in force. 
8.  The irrigation with potable water of landscapes outside of newly constructed homes and buildings in a manner inconsistent with regulations or other requirements established by the California Building Standard Commission and the department of housing and community development. 
9.  The water department, city engineer, and/or public works department will provide notice to any water customer whose usage or other information indicates that a leak may exist in a location under the customer's control. 
B.  The taking of any action in violation of Section 13.16.060A shall be subject to an administrative penalty of up to five hundred dollars for each day in which the violation occurs. Citations for violations may be issued by any member of the police department, the town's code enforcement officer, and any other personnel designated by the city manager, based on observation of the violation or resulting conditions, such as wet areas outside the allowable irrigation areas. Citations shall be issued to the person or persons named on the water department account for that property. If the resident is not present to receive it, a citation may be served by mail or posted on a prominent location on the property. The administrative penalty shall be payable within ten days to the town water department and, if not paid within ten days, shall be added to the water user's bi-monthly bill. 
C.  Any person desiring to contest a citation may file an appeal, which will be heard by the code enforcement panel. As a condition to the filing of the appeal, all outstanding penalties must be paid in full. If the appeal is upheld, the penalty will be refunded. 
D.  In addition to the administrative penalty, repeated violations of this section, in excess of three violations in any thirty-day period, shall constitute a public nuisance which shall be subject to abatement as provided in Chapter 8.16 of the Municipal Code.

13.20.010 - Purpose. 
    The water charges set forth in this chapter pay for the water supply, storage, and system infrastructure needed to supply water to all properties located in the town or located elsewhere but connected to the town's water system. The amount of the charges is based on a fair apportionment of the water supply, storage and system infrastructure costs. 
(Ord. 608 § 10 (part), 2000) 
13.20.020 - Water service charge. 
    The town may impose the water service charge on or after the dates and at or below the adopted maximum rates set forth for each year in the table below. The rates for the water service charge are established on the basis of the size of the meter (in inches) serving a property. Each year the city council will review the need to increase the rates for the water service charge based on the prevailing financial requirements of the water utility. The rate increases will only occur if it is determined that the need still exists and in no event will they exceed the maximum rates set forth in the following table. The table below reflects the rates for the water service charge that will be billed monthly. The finance director has the authority to change the billing from monthly to bi-monthly upon written notice to the ratepayers.

13.20.040 - Water service rates. 
A.  All water customers shall pay the following rates for water service (a "unit" being one hundred cubic feet of water): 
B.  The town may impose the volume charge on or after the dates and at or below the adopted maximum rates set forth for each year in the table below. The volume charge is a variable charge imposed per unit of delivered water, with one unit equal to one hundred cubic feet (HCF), or seven hundred and forty-eight gallons. The rates for residential customers consist of four tiers. The rates for non-residential customers are uniform. The table below reflects the rates for the volume charge that will be billed monthly. If the town bills customers for water services bi-monthly, the rates for the volume charge, and the volume of water within each tier applicable to residential customers, set forth below will double.

    During locally declared water shortages, state mandated reductions in the level of potable water usage, or other natural disaster or event that requires reductions in water usage, the city council may implement revenue stabilization factors to adjust the rates of the volume charge. The revenue stabilization factors to be implemented will be determined on the basis of the level of potable water use reduction required and the revenue required by the water utility to ensure that it recovers sufficient revenue to meet its expenditures and debt obligations. The city council may terminate the revenue stabilization factor if no longer required. If implemented by the city council, the revenue stabilization factors will be applied to the rates of the volume charge. 
    The formula for the revenue stabilization factors is comprised of a conservation and a variable cost component. The conservation component adjusts the volume charge rates to account for the reduction in water usage caused by conservation. The variable component adjusts the rates for the volume charge to account for the town's specific water shortage conditions. The rates for the volume charge then in effect will be multiplied by the applicable revenue stabilization factor to derive the volume charge rates to be in effect until changed by the city council. An example of the formula for calculating the revenue stabilization factor, the application of the formula to address a reduction in water usage of twenty percent, and the resulting revenue stabilization factor to be applied to the volume charge rates is set forth below. 
Revenue Stabilization Factor Formula 
and Sample Calculation for Stage 2 Water Use Reduction 

a = Assumed conservation percentage based on reduction stage = 20 percent for stage 2 
b = Proportion of revenue that comes from the volume charge rates = 73 percent 
c = Proportion of water utility expenses that are variable = 40 percent 
As a further example, the table below demonstrates rates for the volume charge that would be in effect after applying the revenue stabilization factors to the rates in effect in 2017. The table shows the proposed rates followed by the rates that correspond, to each stage of conservation.

A.  Pursuant to the authority of Health and Safety Code Section 5471 and Public Utilities Code Section 10009.6, all water customers shall pay an initial deposit when opening a new water account; provided, however, that when a water customer has multiple water accounts (i.e., multiple water meters) concurrently for the same residence, the water department shall require payment of at least one deposit, but may, in its discretion, waive the requirement for deposits for the additional water account(s). For customers who are billed bi-monthly (i.e., every two months), the maximum deposit may be no more than twice the estimated average water bill and for customers who are billed every month, the maximum deposit may be no more than three times the estimated average water bill. The requirement deposit for all new water accounts (monthly and bi-monthly) shall be five hundred dollars. 
B.  Pursuant to the authority of Health and Safety Code Section 5471, the charge for a special water invoice (i.e., an invoice that is requested by a water customer and that must be prepared manually) shall be twenty-five dollars. 
C.  Pursuant to the authority of Health and Safety Code Section 5473.10, any water bill that is not paid by its due date shall be subject to a basic penalty of ten percent plus an additional penalty of one and one-half percent per month, the additional penalty being calculated against the unpaid water charges plus the ten percent basic penalty. The additional penalty shall accrue beginning on the day after the due date of the unpaid water bill. 
D.  Pursuant to the authority of Civil Code Section 1719, any water customer whose water bill payment check is returned to the town for insufficient funds shall be liable to the town for a service charge of twenty-five dollars for the first bounced check and thirty-five dollars for every bounced check thereafter. In addition, any water service customer who writes a water bill payment check against insufficient funds shall be liable to the town for damages equal to treble the amount of the check; provided, that the town shall first send by certified mail to the water service customer a written demand informing the customer of (1) the provisions of Civil Code Section 1719, (2) the amount of the check, and (3) and the amount of the service charge payable to the town. Such water customer shall then have thirty days from the date the written demand was mailed to pay (1) the amount of the check, (2) the amount of the service charge, and (3) the costs to mail the written demand for payment. If these amounts are not paid within the thirty-day time period, the water customer shall thereafter be liable for the amount of the check plus damages equal to treble the amount of the check (less any partial payments made toward the check and less any amount paid toward the service charge), but in no case shall the treble damages be less than one hundred dollars or more than one thousand five hundred dollars. When a water customer becomes liable for treble damages, the service charge for the check and any costs to mail the written demand shall no longer be owing. 
E.  Pursuant to the authority of Health and Safety Code Section 5473.10, the town may refer any delinquent water bill to a commercial collection service for collection of the total amount owing (including, without limitation, penalties, water service rates, and water meter service charges). In the event that a delinquent water bill is thus referred to collection, the water customer whose bill it is shall also pay a collection fee in an amount equal to the greater of either forty percent of the total amount owing or the amount actually charged to the town by the collection service for collecting such delinquent water bill. 
F.  Pursuant to the authority of Health and Safety Code Section 5471, any water customer whose water service has been terminated because of nonpayment of a delinquent account shall pay, prior to having water service restored, the total amount owing (including, without limitation, penalties, water service rates, and water meter service charges) plus a service reconnection charge as follows: 
    One hundred dollars for reconnection during regular business hours (i.e., when Town Hall is open). 
    One hundred sixty dollars for reconnection during weekends, holidays, and before and after regular business hours. 
G.  Pursuant to the authority of Health and Safety Code Section 5471, the following charges shall be paid by any water customer needing or requesting the described service: 
Service worker after-hour fee $160 per hour* Application for testing laterals for leakage 30 Observation/inspection/re-observation of laterals 50 per hour*  
* fractional hour rounded up to next whole hour

13.20.060 - Use of funds. 
    All charges payable under this chapter shall be paid to the water department of the town and held in a special fund which shall be used solely for the purposes set forth in Section 13.20.010. 
(Ord. 608 § 10 (part), 2000) 
13.20.070 - Unpaid water charges. 
A.  Any person who files with the town's water department an application for water service at a given address shall be liable for payment of all charges set forth in this chapter and any other fees, tolls, rates, rentals, penalties, interest, or other charges applicable by law in connection with such water service. 
B.  Such responsibility shall continue until all amounts described in subsection A of this section are paid in full and either (1) the water department receives a new application from a different person for water service at such address, or (2) the water department receives a written notice from an authorized party that water service for such address is to be discontinued. 
C.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Public Utilities Code Section 10009.6 regarding liability for charges owed by tenants, all record owners of real property to which water service is supplied (together with the person(s) who filed the application with the town's water department for water service to such property) shall be jointly and severally liable for all amounts described in subsection A of this section. 
D.  Pursuant to the authority and requirements of Public Utilities Code Sections 10010.1 and 10011, the following time table shall apply to water bills: 
    Step 1. The due date for water bills shall be thirty days from the date of mailing of the water bill. 
    Step 2. If the water bill is not paid by the due date: 
(a)  The basic penalty of ten percent shall be assessed. 
(b)  The additional penalty of one and one-half percent interest per month shall begin to accrue as of the day after the due date. 
(c)  A notice of delinquency and termination shall be mailed to the water customer, informing the water customer of the imposition of the basic and additional penalties and informing the customer that water service will be terminated (i.e., shut off) if the water bill and penalties are not paid. The delinquency/termination notice shall specify the statutory termination date, which shall be at least fifteen days from the date of mailing of the delinquency/termination notice. 
    Step 3. If the water bill and penalties are not paid by the statutory termination date, the town shall begin the shut-off process as follows: 
(a)  A notice of termination of service, including all of the information set forth in Public Utilities Code Section 10010.1(d), shall be given to the water service customer. Staff shall come to the residence in question and attempt to make personal contact with an adult person residing at the residence to deliver the red tag shut-off notice, informing of the impending termination of water service. If such attempt is not successful, the red tag shut-off notice shall be left at the residence, posted in a conspicuous location at the residence. 
(b)  Water service shall be shut off forty-eight hours or more after the delivery or posting of the red tag shut-off notice; provided, however, that water service shall not be shut off on any Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or at any time during which town hall is not open to the public and provided further that water service shall not be shut off if the water bill and penalties are paid in full prior to actual shut off. 
    Step. 4. If the water bill and penalties are not paid in full prior to actual shut off, the town shall refer the delinquent bill to collection as set forth in Section 13.20.050(E) or, in the alternative, if the water bill remains unpaid sixty days after the due date and asserting a lien would not be inconsistent with Public Utilities Code Section 10009.6 regarding liability for charges owed by tenants, the town may proceed with the lien process set forth in Health and Safety Code Section 5473.11. 
E.  As set forth in Public Utilities Code Section 10010, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph D, water service shall not be terminated for nonpayment (1) during the pendency of an investigation by the town of a customer dispute or complaint, filed as set forth in paragraph F of this section, or (2) when a customer has been granted an extension of the period for payment of a bill, or (3) on the certification of a licensed physician and surgeon that to do so will be life threatening to the customer and the customer is financially unable to pay for service within the normal payment period and is willing to enter into an amortization agreement with the town to amortize over a period not to exceed twelve months the unpaid balance of any bill asserted to be beyond the means of the customer to pay within the normal period for payment. 
F.  Pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 10010 and 10010.1, a water customer may, within fifteen days of receiving a disputed water bill, initiate a complaint or request an investigation. Within thirteen days of the mailing of the notice of delinquency and impending termination, a water customer may request an extension of the payment period of a bill asserted to be beyond the means of the customer to pay in full during the normal period for payment. The water department shall review any such compliant, request for investigation, or request for extension. The review shall include consideration of whether the customer shall be permitted to amortize the unpaid balance of the account over a reasonable period to time, not to exceed twelve months. The water customer may appeal an adverse determination by the water department to the city council. No termination of service may be imposed upon any customer complying with an amortization agreement if the customer also keeps the account current as charges accrue in each subsequent billing period. If the customer fails to comply with an amortization agreement, the water department may terminate water service after giving the customer at least forty-eight hours notice of the condition the customer is required to meet in order to avoid termination. 
G.  As set forth in Public Utilities Code Section 10010.1, the water department shall make available to water customers who are sixty-five years of age or older, or who are dependent adults as defined in Section 15610(b)(1) of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a third-party notification service, whereby the water department will attempt to notify a person designated by the customer to receive notification when the customer's account is past due and subject to termination. The notification shall include information on what is required to prevent termination of service. The water customer shall make a request for third-party notification on a form provided by the water department and shall include the written consent of the designated third party. The third party shall not be liable for any overdue charges. The third-party notification service shall not prevent or delay termination of service.

If a new structure (or structures) is (are) legally constructed on a lot or parcel, but existing topography or geological conditions make it infeasible for the structure(s) to utilize an existing lateral or a common lateral shared among the structures, the city engineer may allow one or more additional laterals to be installed, but the total number of connections to the public sewer mains shall be the minimum feasible. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 1, 6-11-2012) 
13.32.100 - Connections-Crossing neighboring properties. 
A.  New sewer laterals from any lot or parcel may not cross another lot or parcel, regardless of ownership, unless it is demonstrated to the city engineer's satisfaction that no other feasible alternative exists. Approval will not be granted without evidence being provided to the town of a private easement for the new lateral having been obtained from the owner of the adjacent lot or parcel, which shall be recorded with the county. 
B.  If multiple lots or parcels currently share a connection to a public sewer main, that shared lateral may continue to be used. The property owners bear joint responsibility for the maintenance of the lower lateral in the public right-of-way or easement and for the common portion of the upper lateral up to the point at which it branches to serve them separately. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 1, 6-11-2012) 
13.32.105 - Connections-Fee. 
    All sewer connections described in this chapter are subject to a sewer connection fee, payable prior to any connection to the main sewer. The amount of such fees shall be set in the master fee schedule most recently adopted by the city council. 
    All sewer connection fees collected shall be used only for the purposes allowed by law. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 1, 6-11-2012) 
13.32.110 - Property owner responsibility. 
A.  Any lateral sewer or private side sewer which connects with a main sewer in any public street, road, or easement in the town and which has become broken or in need of repair and any water pipeline and connection to the town's meter which pipeline or connection has become damaged or deteriorated shall be repaired by and at the cost and expense of the property owner whose property is drained through such sewer or served by such water pipeline and connection to the town's meter. It is the duty of such property owner to keep such sewers, pipelines and connections in good condition and repair and, if ever any shall be in bad condition or out of repair, to report that fact to the city engineer and to make prompt repairs thereto as required by this chapter and Chapter 31.33. In addition, the city engineer may require that any lateral be inspected at the property owner's expense, including by video inspection, if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the lateral is damaged, deteriorating, or has defects. 
B.  Whenever title to any improved parcel of land is to be transferred to or vested in any person(s) or entity(ies) not theretofore holding such title, all private side sewers and all lateral sewers and all water pipelines and connections to the town's meters shall be tested for infiltration and leaks and inspected (including video inspection) for any other damage, deterioration, or defects requiring repair, and all side and lateral sewers shall be inspected for the presence of an operational IAMPO-approved back flow prevention device. (Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, foreclosures and transfers of undivided interests-but not transfers to the transferor's living trust-constitute transfers of title triggering the requirements of this subsection.) If no such back flow prevention device is in place, and the side and lateral sewers are not sufficiently above grade to prevent a sewage back flow (or if there is an insufficient number of such devices or if such devices are not effectively located), as many such devices shall be installed, prior to the transfer of title, where and as needed to provide effective back flow prevention. 
C.  All testing and inspection procedures shall be approved in advance by the town and done at the expense of the owner whose property is drained or served by the subject sewer, water pipeline or connection. All repair, replacement or upgrade work (including, but not necessarily limited to, installation of IAPMO-approved back flow prevention devices) necessary to prevent all property damage, infiltration and leaks and to otherwise restore the sewers and water pipelines and connections to good operating condition, shall be approved by the town in advance and shall be completed at the property owner's expense (or as the property owner and transferee otherwise apportion the costs between them) prior to the property transfer or vesting of title. Arranging for all such testing, inspection and repair shall in all events be the responsibility of the owner whose property is drained or served by the subject sewer, water pipeline or connection. The requirements for testing, inspection, back flow certification and/or repair may be waived by the city engineer, at his or her discretion, for any parcel whose lateral sewer, water pipeline or connection draining or servicing such parcel has been tested, back flow certified and inspected (and repaired if indicated) pursuant to this section within the two-year period immediately preceding the proposed transfer or vesting of title. 
D.  If any transfer or vesting of title is completed in violation of the provisions of subsections B. and C. of this section, the person(s) or entity(ies) who are owners of such parcel after such transfer or vesting shall be responsible for completion of such testing, inspections and repairs. Failure to do so, after notice from the town, shall be deemed a public nuisance under Section 8.16.010 and applicable provisions of Sections 8.16.020 and 8.16.030 of this Code and subject to abatement under the provisions of Chapter 8.16 of this Code in addition to any other remedies. 
E.  Without limiting the foregoing, transfer of title of real property, the sale of which is being handled in escrow, shall occur on the date such escrow closes. 
F.  The building department shall establish the necessary administrative procedures to implement this section and shall collect inspection fees for (1) the observation of the performance of the initial testing of sewer laterals and/or water service and related inspection and (2) the observation of the performance of each subsequent retesting (required because previous test results were unsatisfactory) and related inspection, including, without limitation, inspection of repairs or replacements made to the sewer laterals and/or water service. The amount of such fees shall be set in the master fee schedule most recently adopted by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 1, 6-11-2012) 
13.32.120 - Property-Improvements. 
A.  Construction of new structures: Whenever a new structure requiring connection to the public sewer main is constructed on a property with an existing private sewer lateral, that lateral shall be subject to evaluation and must be repaired or replaced if necessary. 
B.  Remodeling or renovations of existing structures: When more than one thousand five hundred square feet of an existing structure is remodeled or renovated, the lateral serving the structure shall be subject to evaluation and must be repaired or replaced if necessary. 
C.  Property being subdivided: Each parcel will require a separate lateral connection to the public sewer main when it is improved. Existing sewer laterals must be evaluated, and repaired or replaced if necessary, or they must be removed or abandoned. 
D.  Removal or abandonment of an existing private sewer lateral: If an existing lateral is removed or abandoned, the connection to the sewer main must be removed and replaced with a section of new pipe per the town's standards. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 1, 6-11-2012) 
Chapter 13.33 - PRIVATE SEWER LATERALS 

13.33.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish responsibilities and requirements of the town and individual property owners for the inspection and repair of private sewer laterals, which are determined to be causing or contributing to sanitary sewer overflows. It describes the steps the town will be taking to reduce or eliminate infiltration and inflow coming from defective laterals. It also describes incentives that will be offered by the town to encourage homeowners to rehabilitate their sewer laterals, and it revises the Hillsborough Municipal Code as necessary to clarify what will be required when homeowners or private contractors do sewer lateral rehabilitation work. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.020 - Background. 
A.  Inflow and infiltration (I&I) into the Hillsborough Public Sewer System is a serious public health problem that needs to be addressed system-wide. Excess flows during periods of wet weather and high ground water levels have been overwhelming existing collection and treatment facilities, resulting in sanitary sewer overflows (SSO's) and releases of raw sewage to San Francisco Bay. 
B.  Infiltration from leaking private sewer laterals and connections of private laterals to the public sewer mains is a substantial source of excess flow volume. Video inspections of private sewer laterals have shown that older laterals commonly have some degree of damage. 
C.  In addition to the increased flow volume due to infiltration, leaking private sewer lateral pipes and connections to the public sewer mains allow intruding roots to build up and cause blockages that result in SSO's at lateral cleanouts and at upstream manholes. 
D.  During periods of dryer weather, leaking sewer laterals allow exfiltration of raw sewage to contaminate the surrounding ground and to leach down into the underlying aquifer. 
E.  Smoke testing has demonstrated that inflow from direct connections between rainwater collection systems and private sewer laterals is another substantial cause of excess flows during periods of wet weather. 
F.  The town owns and operates a sanitary sewer collection system that is regulated by Statewide General Waste Discharge Requirements (Order No. 2006-0003 DWQ), The Order, also referred to as the "General Sanitary Sewer Overflow Waste Discharge Requirements (General SSO WDR), prohibits sanitary sewer overflows (SSO's) that "result in a discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater to waters of the United States" or that "creates a nuisance as defined in CWC Section 13050 (m)". Additionally, the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)'s Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay Basin prohibits the "discharge of raw sewage or any waste failing to meet waste discharge requirements to any waters of the Basin". 
G.  From January 2003 through January 2009, the town experienced 89 SSO events in violation of the above regulations. The SSO events occurred during wet weather and resulted from rainfall entering the town's defective sewer mains and defective privately owned sewer laterals. In response to these events, and on-going SSO's during wet weather, the Town of Hillsborough was issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board on March 11, 2009. The CDO requires the elimination of SSO's. It includes requirements and provisions to resolve the causes of SSO's in order to eliminate sewage discharges to storm drains, surface waters and ground water of the State and the United States. 
H.  In accordance with the CDO requirements, the town has developed a comprehensive plan to eliminate SSO's. In addition to rehabilitating and/or replacing defective public sewers, the plan encourages the repair and rehabilitation of privately owned sewer laterals. 
I.  Throughout most of the town, SSO's can be eliminated through a combination of system capacity increases and elimination of I&I. In one sub-basin that drains into a trunk main that cannot be increased in capacity, the only option for reducing SSO's is to reduce peak discharges by eliminating I&I. This sub-basin will constitute the initially scheduled phase of the comprehensive program to rehabilitate sewer drainage sub-basins throughout the town. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.030 - Definitions. 
A.  "City engineer" means the City Engineer of the Town of Hillsborough, or his/her designated agent. 
B.  "Cleanout" means a pipe fitting and associated piping connected to a sewer pipeline that provides access to the line for purposes of flushing, rodding, cleaning, and other maintenance and diagnostic purposes. Cleanouts are required at property lines or easement lines, at regular intervals along long laterals, and above joints where laterals branch. They shall be two-way cleanouts as described in the town's standard details, which are available from the city engineer's office or the town's website, and shall be installed so as to allow access by a push-type video camera in both directions. A one-way cleanout is required at the upper end of every sewer lateral, just outside of the structure it serves. 
C.  "Code" means the Hillsborough Municipal Code. 
D.  "Compliance certificate" means a certificate issued by the town indicating that the sewer lateral has passed verification testing and inspection as described in this title. 
E.  "Easement" means a corridor on privately-owned property, within which the town is granted the rights to enter and to do work for purposes of repair or maintenance of sewer facilities, and the right to remove private landscaping or other physical improvements thereon, and including prescriptive easements. 
F.  "Emergency" means emergencies may include, but are not limited to: power outages, equipment failure, storms, flood, fire, earthquake, riots, and any extraordinary event that requires a short term change to the requirements of this Title. 
G.  "Infiltration and inflow" (I&I) means the groundwater and rainwater that enters a sanitary sewer system intended for wastewater flows. "Infiltration" is water that enters the sewer system through openings in the joints or walls of pipes and manholes. "Inflow" is water that enters the sewer system directly, such as through uncapped lateral cleanouts, openings in manhole covers, and connections from area drains, catch basins, foundation drains, roof drains and other sources of non-sewage water. 
H.  "Lining" means insertion of new material within an existing pipe to form a leak-proof inner shell, including reattachment of branching pipes or otherwise sealing their connection to the liner; also, the material so inserted. 
I.  "Non-sanitary sewer connection" means prohibited conduits that directly or indirectly convey storm water, surface water, roof runoff, intercepted groundwater or subsurface drainage into sanitary sewers, including, but not limited to, down spouts, yard drains, sump pumps, overflows, or other sources of rain water, surface run-off, or groundwater. 
J.  "Pipe bursting" means replacement of a pipe by causing the pipe to be broken and expanded outward within the ground, and a new pipe inserted within the expanded pipe, including reattachment of branch and terminal connections in a finished, leak-proof fashion. 
K.  "Repair" means correction of isolated defects in the sewer lateral; also, the corrections themselves. 
L.  "Replacement" means substitution of new material for the complete length of the sewer lateral; includes either removal of the existing pipe and placement of new pipe, or pipe bursting or lining of the existing pipe. 
M.  "Sanitary sewer" means a pipe and appurtenant fittings, cleanouts and manholes, for conveying sanitary sewage and to which stormwater or surface water shall not be admitted. 
N.  "Sewage" means discarded contaminated water, or a combination of water and other fluids carrying wastes from plumbing fixtures in residences or business, institutional or industrial facilities. 
O.  "Sewer lateral" means the privately owned pipeline that carries sewage and liquid wastes from the structure or structures served, or a branched pipe network with multiple connections from sewage sources, to and including the connection to the sewer main, manhole or sewer main cleanout, including any portion under streets or within public rights-of-way. A sewer lateral may also be referred to as a "side sewer" or "lateral sewer." A sewer lateral is comprised of two distinct sections: 
1.  "Lower sewer lateral " means the portion of a sewer lateral extending from the proximity of the property line or right-of-way line or the edge of the easement, to the publicly owned sewer system, including the cleanout at its upstream end and the connection to the sewer main at its downstream end. 
2.  "Upper sewer lateral" means the portion of the sewer lateral or lateral network extending to the proximity of the property line or right-of-way line or the edge of the easement, from the structure or structures served. 
P.  "Sewer main" means a publicly-owned sanitary sewer pipe. 
Q.  "Structure" means any building or ancillary construction, which may include utility and/or landscaping facilities. 
R.  "Town" or "city" means where the law ascribes certain authorities or responsibilities to a "city" official or governing body, the term "town" may be interchanged with "city" and it refers to the Town of Hillsborough. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.040 - Applicability. 
A.  Whenever the town rehabilitates a public sewer main, the provisions of this ordinance apply to all private laterals connected to it. 
B.  A town-wide rehabilitation of sewer mains and private laterals will be implemented on the basis of sewer drainage sub-basins prioritized by the city engineer according to their volume of I&I. In addition, from time to time individual sewer mains elsewhere in town may be fully rehabilitated if they are too badly degraded for spot repairs to be cost-effective. 
C.  When a public sewer main is rehabilitated, the town, at its own cost, will upgrade the lower laterals as necessary and will install or upgrade the cleanouts at the edges of the public right of way or easement as needed. At that time, the town will evaluate the upper laterals, and if deficiencies are identified the owners of properties with defective laterals will be encouraged to rehabilitate them. The town will waive certain fees, and the homeowners will be offered the opportunity to coordinate with the town's work, saving significant costs. 
D.  Because the problem of I&I is of such severity and importance, every property owner or resident shall allow access to the town's personnel or contractors to conduct the testing and inspections described below. They will be asked to minimize their use of their sewer lateral while the work is underway. 
E.  Individual properties are already required to have their laterals upgraded upon certain transfers of title as described in the Hillsborough Municipal Code. If an owner has upgraded their lateral through this program they will be exempted from that requirement for a number of years as described below. 
F.  Smoke or dye testing. 
1.  In order to locate sources of inflow and infiltration, as defined below, the town will systematically test private sewer laterals by pumping low-pressure, non-toxic smoke into isolated segments of public sewer mains, and then observing where the smoke is released on the properties with laterals feeding into that segment. Properly installed plumbing and storm drainage fixtures will not allow the smoke to escape into the structures served. 
2.  Prior to conducting a smoke test, the owners and residents of the affected properties will be notified with written explanations of what is to be done and what they should do to prepare for it. They will be provided with contact information for obtaining additional information or answers to specific questions. Information will also be posted on the town's website. 
3.  When a segment of sewer main is being tested, the town's personnel or contractors will need to thoroughly examine each property with laterals connected to that segment. The inspectors will observe the grounds between the sewer main and all structures as well as the area around each structure. They will photograph and make note of any smoke observed at any locations on the grounds and particularly at drains and roof gutters. 
4.  If necessary to confirm a source of inflow, a non-toxic dye may be poured into a suspected source while an observer at a downstream manhole watches for it. The dye used for this is non-polluting and has no harmful effects on the system. 
5.  If illegal sources of inflow are observed, the property owner shall be required to correct the conditions. 
G.  Video inspections of private laterals by the town's contractors. 
1.  When the town rehabilitates a segment of public sewer main, the private laterals connected to it will be examined at the same time unless they are specifically exempted as provided in Section 13.33.080 below. 
2.  Prior to examining a lateral, the owner and residents of the property will be notified with written explanations of what is to be done and what they should do to prepare for it. They will be provided with contact information for obtaining additional information or answers to specific questions. Information will also be posted on the town's website. 
3.  A closed circuit television (CCTV) camera designed specifically for this purpose will be inserted into the lateral from wherever access can be obtained (i.e. a cleanout, or a roof vent), and a digital video record will be made of the inspection. 
4.  If a proper two-way cleanout (see the definitions section above) does not currently exist at the property line or the edge of the easement, the town will have one installed; during that procedure the lateral above and below that point will be video-inspected. 
5.  If a lateral is too badly clogged for a reliable video inspection, an attempt may be made to clean it. 
6.  The digital video, showing any defects and their measured locations, will be shared with the property owner, and the owner will be informed of their responsibilities regarding the upper portion as well as the incentives offered by the town through this program. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.050 - Standards. 
A.  When private sewer laterals are repaired or rehabilitated, they must be inspected and approved by the town. Inspection shall consist of external visual examination by a town inspector during construction and a closed circuit television (CCTV) inspection of the interior recorded on digital video. Final approval shall be contingent upon passing a pressure test as described in the California Plumbing Code. 
B.  Standards for visual approval of a sewer lateral: any of the following may be cause for failure and require correction: 
1.  Intrusion of roots. 
2.  Offsets of more than half the pipe wall thickness at joints. 
3.  Cracks clearly evident in video. 
4.  Any breaks or holes through pipe wall. 
5.  Excessive corrosion of iron pipe. 
6.  Interior spalling of vitrified clay pipe. 
7.  Tears, holes or loose edges of previously applied pipe liners. 
8.  Accumulations of grease, encrustations, sediment or any debris or material that could not be removed by conventional cleaning. 
9.  Sags that retain liquid to a depth exceeding approximately ten percent of the pipe diameter. 
10.  Bends that prohibit the passage of an inspection camera. 
11.  Lack of an approved cleanout proximate to the point where the pipe enters the structure, and at the property line or easement line, as well as intermediately at branches, changes of direction and along long laterals as required, or lack of any other required backflow prevention or overflow device in good working condition. 
12.  Non-water-tight connections between the lateral and the sewer main, as indicated by root intrusion, visible gaps or cracks in the main adjacent to the connection. 
13.  The lateral protruding into the sewer main beyond the main's inner surface. 
C.  Video inspection standards. 
1.  The television camera used shall be one specifically designed and constructed for such inspection. It must have integrated lighting and be capable of producing a clear image in reasonably accurate color, even when submerged or operating in one hundred percent humidity conditions. 
2.  Lighting shall be sufficient to provide clear illumination of the entire perimeter of the pipe for several feet ahead. 
3.  The camera shall be pushed or pulled in as nearly continuous a motion as practicable, without skipping any portions of the pipe, at no greater than thirty feet per minute. It shall be stopped at any observed features, such as joints, defects, branch connections or irregularities of any kind, and shall be slowly advanced back and forth as needed to provide as full a view of the feature as possible. The video shall show the area around the point of entry of the camera in order to confirm the location, as well as a clear image, of the cleanout or the sewer main at the end of the survey. 
4.  The video shall include a text description of the time, date and direction of the survey, and the address of the property inspected; the metered length of the survey must be accurately displayed on the video as the survey progresses. If full inspection of a private lateral or branched lateral system is done in multiple surveys, the specific location of each video shall be clearly identified. 
5.  The video must include an accompanying audio track containing descriptive comments from the operator. 
6.  Digital recordings submitted to the town must be in a format that can be read by the town's computers running Microsoft Windows operating systems and Windows Media Player software without requiring file conversion. Alternate video file specifications may be approved by the city engineer. 
7.  Digital recordings submitted to the town must be on DVD discs, indelibly labeled with the time and date of the recording session and the address of the property inspected. Digital files shall be named in a fashion that uniquely identifies each inspection record, and a full description of the time, date, location and direction of survey shall also be included as a common text or HTML file. Multiple inspection records may be placed on a single DVD disc as long as they are uniquely identifiable and an index is included as a common text or HTML file. 
8.  Videos may be rejected if they are not sufficiently clear to the satisfaction of the city engineer, and they will have to be redone and resubmitted. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.060 - Responsibilities of property owners. 
A.  Whenever the town installs or replaces a clean-out at the property line or the easement line, or tests, inspects, repairs or replaces any portion of the lateral, the property owner shall remain responsible for ongoing maintenance of the entire lateral down to and including the connection to the sewer main. 
B.  Property owners must allow access, onto and across their properties, by town employees or agents or contractors doing sewer testing, repairs or maintenance for the town, and they must cooperate to allow the work to be done. If necessary to gain access to an easement, town crews or contractors must be allowed to pass over private property as well as the easement. 
C.  The town's crews and contractors will make every attempt to avoid causing damage to landscaping and private improvements overlying public facilities (sewer mains, cleanouts and manholes) and/or private laterals being repaired or rehabilitated, and will make reasonable efforts to restore the landscaping and improvements upon completion of the work. However, the ultimate responsibility for removal and protection of the landscaping and improvements, and for replacement afterward to their own satisfaction, shall remain with the property owner. Landscaping or improvements may not be placed over manholes or cleanouts, nor in such proximity as to make the manhole or cleanout inaccessible. Any such private obstacles may be removed and shall not be put back. 
D.  Properties owned by institutions or organizations: 
1.  Public schools: The town will work cooperatively with school officials to reduce I&I, in recognition that both parties serve the interests and well-being of the same constituents. 
2.  Privately-owned schools, private institutions, facilities and meeting places: Non-public organizations owning property served by lateral connection(s) to the public sewer system shall be subject to the same requirements and responsibilities as private property owners. 
3.  Properties owned by partnerships or corporations: For properties owned by partnerships or corporations, including properties with structures occupied by one or multiple tenants, responsibility for compliance with this title shall fall upon the party or parties responsible for ownership. 
E.  In situations where more than one property share a common private lateral, the property owners shall equally share responsibility for work required on the shared portion, and shall be individually responsible for work required on their separate portions. Individual cleanouts shall be installed just above each connection to a shared lateral if feasible. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.070 - Responsibilities of the town. 
A.  When the town performs I&I rehabilitation on a segment of a sewer main it will also repair or rehabilitate all of the lower laterals as needed, including the cleanouts proximate to the property lines, right-of-way lines or easement lines. 
B.  When the town inspects, and repairs or replaces if necessary, the lower portion of a lateral, the town will also evaluate the upper portion of the lateral unless evidence satisfactory to the city engineer is provided that documents that the upper lateral has been newly installed, has been fully replaced in accordance with town standards within the preceding five years, or the property owner has a current Compliance Certificate. 
C.  If the town's inspection of an upper lateral indicates the need for repair or replacement, the town will notify the property owner of the owner's responsibilities under the Hillsborough Municipal Code, and will provide documentation of the conditions that require attention. The contractor performing work for the town will be directed to provide the owner with a price quote for the necessary work. 
D.  The town will maintain a list of plumbing contractors known to be qualified to perform the work, although providing names from that list to a property owner shall not be construed as recommendations or endorsements of those contractors. 
E.  If the property owner chooses to contract with the town's contractor, the town shall not participate in any way in that agreement or that work other than to inspect the work as it would with any other contractor doing private improvements. If the owner chooses to have the work done by anyone else, they may not begin until the town's work at the cleanout and downstream to the main is completed, including backfilling any excavations on the subject property. 
F.  The town will waive permit fees for repair or replacement work done on an upper lateral if it is done by the contractor working for the town rehabilitating the lower lateral and/or cleanout, or if it is completed by another contractor within ninety days of completion of work on the lower lateral and/or cleanout. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.080 - Private lateral compliance certification process. 
A.  General provisions. 
1.  A private sewer lateral for which a compliance certificate has been granted shall be exempted from the testing and inspection requirements presented elsewhere in this title for the duration of the certificate's term, as described below, unless it has been physically altered. 
2.  If a homeowner wishes to obtain a compliance certificate at any time other than when the town is rehabilitating the public sewer main serving the property, the owner shall provide documentation demonstrating compliance or shall arrange for a pressure test to be conducted; the pressure test must be observed and approved by the town's inspector. 
3.  After a fully repaired or replaced private sewer lateral has been inspected and has passed the required tests, and has been approved by the town, or after satisfactory evidence has been provided documenting that the lateral was newly and legally installed within the previous five years, a compliance certificate with a term described below will be issued to the property owner. 
4.  If a compliance certificate had already been obtained prior to the town's rehabilitation of a public sewer main, it will continue to run its original term. 
B.  Term of compliance certificate. 
1.  New, or entirely replaced, laterals-Twenty years from the date of installation. 
2.  Repaired laterals, or existing laterals that pass an approved pressure test-Ten years. 
3.  If evidence satisfactory to the city engineer is provided that documents that the upper lateral had been newly installed or fully replaced in accordance with town standards within the preceding five years, a compliance certificate will be provided to the property owner with a term of twenty years from the documented date of installation. 
4.  Once a compliance certificate is issued to the property owner it shall be the property owner's responsibility to renew the certificate before expiration of its term. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.090 - Administration and enforcement. 
A.  The city engineer shall be the authority with regard to questions or disputes arising under this title. 
B.  Private sewer laterals that are found to be leaking may be declared a public health nuisance subject to abatement as provided for in Section 1.08.010 of the Code. 
C.  If a property is found to be out of compliance with this title, the town will attempt to contact and inform the property owner or responsible party, either directly or through an agent of the owner, by mail, telephone, email or other common means. If, after all reasonable efforts are made, no response is received, the town's crews or contractors shall be authorized to enter the property for testing or inspection or for abatement or remedial work. 
D.  If a property owner refuses to grant access to town crews or contractors to test or inspect their private sewer lateral, the town shall obtain an inspection warrant, as provided for in Section 1822.50 et seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure, to allow the work to proceed. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.100 - Private sewer lateral improvement loans. 
A.  The town may implement a program for providing financial loans to property owners upon whom the burden of the town's I&I elimination program would impose a financial hardship. 
B.  Details of the loan amounts and repayment terms and conditions will be established by the city council and will be reviewed and updated from time to time as appropriate. 
C.  Information on the current available loan amount and repayment terms and conditions will be posted on the town's website and will also be available from the city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 702, § 2, 6-11-2012) 
13.33.110 - Emergency suspensions. 
    In the event of an emergency, the city engineer shall have the authority to temporarily suspend any or all of the provisions of this title until the next meeting of the city council, at which time a report will be given to the council explaining the reasons for the suspension and making recommendations regarding revisions or conditions for the reinstatement of the provision(s). During such suspensions, any remaining provisions shall continue in effect.

13.34.010 - Purpose. 
    The town maintains a sewer department and contracts with neighboring jurisdictions for the processing of the town's sewage. The city council has determined that an annual sewer service charge applicable to each real property connected to the town's sewer system is necessary to meet the expenses of the sewer department and the town's contractual obligations with respect to its sewer agreements. The sewer charges set forth in this chapter are based on a careful analysis of the town's costs of sewer treatment, operations, and debt service and are designed to constitute a pass-through of those costs as best as can be determined. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the sewer service charges and related provisions. 
(Ord. 608 § 23, 2000: Ord. 416, 1985) 
13.34.020 - Authority to fix. 
    California Health and Safety Code Section 5471 authorizes the town to set sewer service charges by ordinance. 
(Ord. 416, 1985) 
13.34.030 - Service charge. 
    The town may charge sewer service charges at or below the amounts set forth for each year in the table below, but not in excess of the maximum charges shown. Such schedule of maximum charges is to be effective July 1, 2016, and the maximum charges for each year are to be increased according to the schedule set forth in the table below.

Division V. - Storm Drainage 
Chapter 13.50 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND DISCHARGE CONTROL 
Sections: 

13.50.010 - Findings and purpose. 
    The city council finds and declares as follows: 
A.  The 1987 Amendments to the Federal Clean Water Act, as implemented by Environmental Protection Agency regulations adopted November 16, 1990, make necessary the adoption of plans and programs for storm water management meeting specified criteria. 
B.  Section 402(p) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987, requires that all large and medium sized incorporated municipalities must: 
1.  "Effectively" prohibit non-stormwater discharges into the storm sewer; and 
2.  Require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants from stormwater systems to waters of the United States to the maximum extent practicable (MEP). 
C.  The town of Hillsborough seeks to comply with all provisions of state and federal law. 
D.  In order to implement the federal regulatory requirements described above, the town of Hillsborough is a co-permittee to the "San Mateo County Storm Water Management Plan, 1993-1998" dated June 21, 1993. 
E.  On September 15, 1993, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region, issued Order No. 93-106, NPDES Permit No. CA 0029921, regulating, inter alia, stormwater discharges by the town of Hillsborough. 
F.  The implementation of pollutant control measures described in the plan in furtherance of these purposes is exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 21100) of Division 13 of the Public Resources Code, as provided in categorical exemption Classes 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and/or 21 of the CEQA Guidelines (Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Sections 15301-15329). 
G.  The city council has carefully considered the proposed stormwater management program and finds that it contributes to the comprehensiveness of the town of Hillsborough and protection of the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens. 
(Ord. 600 § 1, 1999; Ord. 530, 1993) 
13.50.020 - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "town of Hillsborough stormwater management and discharge control ordinance" and may be so cited. 
(Ord. 600 § 1, 1999; Ord. 530, 1993) 
13.50.030 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to ensure the future health, safety, and general welfare of the town of Hillsborough's citizens by: 
A.  Eliminating discharges: eliminating non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer; 
B.  Controlling discharges: controlling the discharge to municipal separate storm sewers from spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than storm water; and 
C.  Reducing pollutants: reducing pollutants in storm water discharges to the maximum extent practicable. 
    The intent of this chapter is to protect and enhance the water quality of our watercourses, water bodies and wetlands in a manner pursuant to and consistent with the Clean Water Act.

Specifically, the definitions of the following terms included in that statute or regulations are hereby incorporated by reference, as now applicable or as may hereafter be amended: discharge, illicit discharge, pollutant and stormwater. These terms presently are defined as follows: 
1.  Discharge. 
a.  Any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source; or 
b.  Any addition of any pollutant to the waters of the contiguous zone or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft. 
2.  Illicit Discharge. Any discharge to the city storm sewer system that is not composed entirely of stormwater except discharges pursuant to a NPDES permit and discharges resulting from firefighting and other emergency response activities. 
3.  Pollutant. Dredged soil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, radioactive materials, wrecked or destroyed equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and industrial municipal, and agricultural waste discharge into water.

13.50.080 - Waiver procedures. 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to protect and enhance water quality while respecting the rights of private property owners to economically viable use of land. It is not the intent of this chapter to prohibit all economically viable use of any private lands, nor to result in a confiscatory impact. Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to provide for an administrative procedure for a waiver or modification of a particular provision of this chapter in the event the strict application of this chapter would result in the denial of all economically viable use of real property. 
B.  Waiver Application. An applicant for a waiver of a provision of this chapter shall file a waiver application with the city engineer on a form provided by the city identifying the provision sought to be waived or modified. The applicant shall file a complete form and shall provide all documentation and information required by the city engineer to determine whether application of the provision in question will prohibit any economically viable use of the land in question or otherwise have an impermissible confiscatory result. 
C.  Action on Application. The city engineer may approve, deny, or conditionally approve a waiver application upon making all of the following written findings: 
1.  Denial of Economically Viable Use. That the strict application of the provision for which a waiver or modification is sought would result in the denial of all economically viable use of the real property in question; 
2.  Maximum Achievement of Goals of Chapter. To the maximum extent feasible, conditions have been placed upon such a waiver or modification in order to achieve the goals of this chapter as closely as possible while still allowing economically viable use of the real property in question; and 
3.  No Public Nuisance. Approval of such a waiver will not result in a public nuisance which would constitute a significant and direct threat to public health or safety. 
(Ord. 600 § 1, 1999; Ord. 530, 1993) 
13.50.090 - Discharge of pollutants. 
    The discharge of non-stormwater discharges to the city storm sewer system is prohibited. All discharges of material other than storm water must be in compliance with a NPDES Permit issued for the discharge (other than NPDES Permit No. CA 0029921) and this chapter. 
A.  Exception to Discharge Prohibition for NPDES Permit Holders. The prohibition on discharges shall not apply to any discharge regulated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to the discharger and administered by the State of California under authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharge is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit and other applicable laws or regulations. 
B.  Exception to Discharge Prohibition for Certain Activities. Discharges from the following activities will not be considered a source of pollutants to waters of the United States when properly managed: water line flushing and other discharges from potable water sources, municipal street cleaning, municipal park maintenance, landscape irrigation and lawn watering, irrigation water, diverted stream flows, rising ground waters, infiltration to separate storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation and footing drains, water from crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, individual residential car washings, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges, or flows from fire-fighting and other emergency response activity, and accordingly are not subject to the prohibition on discharges. 
(Ord. 600 § 1, 1999; Ord. 530, 1993)

Chapter 13.54 - STORM DRAINAGE CHARGES 
Sections: 

13.54.010 - Purpose. 
    The town has adopted a Stormwater Management and Discharge Control ordinance (Chapter 13.50 of the Hillsborough Municipal Code) implementing the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program in Hillsborough as mandated by federal law. The city council has determined that an annual storm drainage charge applicable to each parcel in the town is necessary to meet the town's costs associated with this program. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth such storm drainage charge and related provisions. 
(Ord. 600 §§ 2 and 4, 1999; Ord. 541, 06/27/94) 
13.54.020 - Authority to fix. 
    California Health and Safety Code Section 5471 authorizes the town to set storm drainage charges by ordinance.

Title 14 - TREES 
Chapters: 
Chapter 14.04 - TREE REMOVAL 
Sections: 

14.04.010 - Purpose-Intent. 
A.  This chapter is adopted because the town has been forested by stands of oak, bay, redwood, pine and other trees, the preservation of which is necessary for the health and welfare of the citizens of this town in order to preserve the scenic beauty, prevent erosion of soil, protect against flood hazards and the risk of landslides, counteract the pollutants in the air, maintain the climatic balance and decrease wind velocities, and relieve the public of cost of installing and maintaining storm water drainage systems. 
B.  It is the intent of this chapter to establish regulations for the removal of trees in order to retain as many trees as possible consistent with the purpose hereof and the reasonable economic enjoyment of private property. 
(Ord. 618 § 11 (part), 2001; Ord. 608 § 3 (part), 2000: Ord. 346 § 2, 1977; Ord. 322 § 1, 1973; prior code § 100.7.10) 
14.04.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, the following words have the meaning respectively ascribed to them, unless otherwise specifically indicated in this chapter: 
    Grove. "Grove" means a group of a least five woody plants of the same type with a diameter of six inches or more measured at four feet, six inches above natural grade. 
    Removal of a Tree. "Removal of a tree" means major surgery of the trunk of a tree which shall in effect destroy the tree. 
    Tree. "Tree" means any woody plant which has a trunk with a diameter of twelve inches or more measured at four feet, six inches above natural grade. 
1.  Trees shall be divided into two groups for the purpose of this definition, as follows: 
a.  Those which will sucker back after major surgery to the trunk, such as eucalyptus and poplar; and 
b.  Those which will not sucker back. 
2.  In the case of a tree which will sucker back, removal of a tree is defined as severance of the trunk less than ten feet above natural grade. In all other cases, removal is defined as major surgery to the tree which, in the opinion of a recognized consultant in tree care, has the effect of destroying the tree. 
(Ord. 618 § 11 (part), 2001; Ord. 608 § 3 (part), 2000: Ord. 322 § 1, 1973; prior code § 100.7.20) 
14.04.030 - Procedure-In subdivisions. 
A.  All subdivision maps or divisions of land filed for tentative approval shall clearly designate all trees and/or groves upon the property proposed for subdivision or division; provided, however, that regarding areas to be dedicated to open space, only a general statement relating to species of trees will suffice. Those trees and/or groves proposed to be removed and those trees and/or groves proposed to be retained shall be shown by size and species on the map. Any proposed additions or replacements of trees and/or groves shall also be indicated by size and species on the map. 
B.  The city engineer shall, at the time the tentative subdivision map or application for division of land comes up for consideration by the city council or appropriate city officer, render his opinion as to whether the proposal should be accepted, rejected or modified. In rendering such opinion, he shall take into consideration the recommendations adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time as to which trees are desirable and which undesirable for various purposes and locations within the town. 
C.  The city council or other appropriate city officer shall, at the time of making its tentative approval, consider the report of the city engineer and any other pertinent information and either accept, reject, or modify the proposal made by the property owner under this chapter. 
D.  The developer of the property shall, as a condition to the final approval of the subdivision map or division of land, agree in writing to comply with such conditions imposed under this chapter and secure the performance of such agreement in the same manner required by the "Subdivision Map Act" of the state of California for the installation of any improvement on the property involved. The agreement shall contain any conditions imposed by the town in regards to maintenance of existing trees and replacement of removed trees. 
E.  The developer shall be required, as a part of the agreement, to mark with paint the trees and/or groves finally agreed to be retained and shall protect the same by fencing or other appropriate means in order to clearly identify the area where no work is to take place. The developer shall also make adequate provisions to protect the root systems of such trees and/or groves during all periods of construction of improvements and/or grading operations. 
F.  Final approval of a map by the town shall constitute a permit to remove any trees and/or groves designated on the tentative map as approved. Any changes in the trees and/or groves to be removed as so designated and approved by the town shall require an application for a new permit under the provisions of this chapter. 
G.  The city council shall consider the following matters in determining conditions to be imposed under this chapter: 
1.  The type of trees, their desirability in the neighborhood, and the condition of the trees with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures, and interferences with utility services; 
2.  Necessity to remove trees in order to construct proposed improvements to allow reasonable economic enjoyment of the property upon which trees are located. The following should be considered in this context: 
a.  Mitigation measures proposed to minimize the adverse impact; 
b.  Alternative plans for development which will lessen the adverse impact on the removal; 
c.  Assessment of the relationship between local short term benefit and detriment to the long term benefit and detriment (e.g., replacing open space with housing); 
3.  Topography of land and the effect of tree removal on erosion, soil retention, and the diversion or increased flow of surface waters; 
4.  Number of trees existing in the neighborhood on improved property and the effect of the tree removal on the neighborhood; 
5.  Good forestry practices, including, but not necessarily limited to, the number of healthy trees that a parcel of land will support. 
H.  The city council may, upon motion, exclude any subdivision from the operation of this article which is subject to site or architectural control sufficient to accomplish the purpose of this chapter. 
(Ord. 618 § 11 (part), 2001; Ord. 608 § 3 (part), 2000: Ord. 322 § 1, 1973; prior code § 100.7.30) 
14.04.040 - Procedure-Improved land other than subdivisions. 
A.  No clearing for the construction of any improvement on lands other than for subdivision or division of lands shall be permitted or building permit issued without the site plan having first been approved by the city engineer or his authorized representative. Tree removal shall be planned and accomplished so as to preserve trees and other desirable plant life native to the area. Trees shall not be destroyed or removed solely for the sake of ease of construction. Only those trees may be removed which the city engineer deems necessary or desirable for the construction of improvements and the economic enjoyment of the property and the preservation of its natural setting. 
B.  Tree removal on improved land, not described in subsection A of this section, shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 17.56. 
C.  Any additional planting proposed or required by the city engineer shall meet all the provisions of this code. 
D.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of Section 17.56.050, the city engineer may issue a permit for the removal of a tree described in such subsection A, without review by the architecture and design review board, if the owner or occupant of the real property on which the tree is located presents a written opinion from a certified arborist that, because of disease or damage or danger to persons or property, the tree needs to be removed within the next thirty days. 
(Ord. 654 §§ 16 (part), 17, 2004; Ord. 618 § 11 (part), 2001; Ord. 608 § 3 (part), 2000: Ord. 346 § 3, 1977; Ord. 322 § 1, 1973; prior code § 100.7.33) 
14.04.050 - Procedure-Unimproved land other than subdivisions. 
A.  No tree removal shall be permitted on any vacant unimproved land without first obtaining approval from the city engineer or his authorized representative. 
B.  The city engineer shall consider the following in determining his approval or denial: 
1.  Type of tree; 
2.  Desirability in the neighborhood; 
3.  Condition of the tree with respect to disease, danger of falling, or interference with utility services; 
4.  Effect on erosion, soil retention, and the diversion or increased flow of surface water; 
5.  Good forestry practices; 
6.  Number of existing trees to remain; 
7.  Alternatives available. 
(Ord. 654 § 16 (part), 2004; Ord. 618 § 11 (part), 2001; Ord. 608 § 3 (part), 2000: Ord. 346 § 4, 1977; Ord. 322 § 1, 1973; prior code § 100.7.37) 
14.04.060 - Violation-Penalty. 
A.  Any person who damages or destroys a tree, in violation of this chapter or any agreement entered into pursuant thereto, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. In addition, if any tree has been so damaged or destroyed, the city engineer may require that such tree be restored to its former condition under the direction of, and to the approval of, the city engineer or, if the tree is not capable of being restored to its former condition, or has been destroyed, that it be replaced within one year after a determination by the city engineer that the tree is not able to be restored to its former condition, or within one year after the destruction of the tree, with a tree that has been approved by the city engineer. 
B.  The city engineer shall base his approval upon the similarity of size and species of the replacement tree to the tree which was destroyed unless such a replacement would create great hardship to such person subject to the requirements of this title. 
(Ord. 618 § 11 (part), 2001; Ord. 608 § 3 (part), 2000: Ord. 322 § 1, 1973; prior code § 100.7.40)

Chapter 15.24 - GRADING* 
Sections: 

15.24.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to prevent soil erosion, protect public and private drainage systems, and to otherwise protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. 617 § 1 (part), 2001) 
15.24.020 - Definitions-Construction of words. 
    The following definitions and constructions apply to this chapter: 
A.  The singular number includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular. The masculine gender includes the other genders. 
B.  "Grading" means excavating or moving material as defined in subsection (D) of this section and includes, without limitation, digging up, scraping, leveling, uprooting, scarifying, tunneling, blasting, altering, filling, moving on site or trucking in or out of any quantity of material. The amount or volume of grading referred to in this chapter includes all possible combinations of the operations as mentioned herein. 
C.  "Ground" means the normal, undisturbed contour and elevation of the native ground and its natural verdure of trees, shrubs, brush, grass, etc., before any alterations required or intended for construction or landscaping purposes. 
D.  "Material" means any dirt, soil, rock, sand, rubble, debris or any fill material which by its moving, removal or importation can change the natural contour of the ground. 
(Ord. 617 § 1 (part), 2001) 
15.24.030 - Permit-When required. 
A.  Grading falls into three categories as follows: 
Category 1: Grading under fifty cubic yards of material shall require no grading permit; such minor grading shall be considered approved along with the granting of a building permit. Category 2: Grading of fifty or more cubic yards of material, with a maximum of one thousand five hundred cubic yards to be taken from the site to an off-site location and/or from an off-site location to the site, shall require a grading permit (in addition to any other approvals and/or permits that may be required) as set forth in Section 15.24.040. Category 3: Grading of fifty or more cubic yards of material, more than one thousand five hundred cubic yards of which to be taken from the site to an off-site location and/or from an off-site location to the site, shall require a grading permit (in addition to any other approvals and/or permits that may be required) as set forth in Section 15.24.040 and shall also require approval of the city council as set forth in Section 15.24.070.  
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no grading permit or city council approval shall be required for any of the town's own projects, construction, or work. 
B.  In calculating amounts, the amount of material to be removed (whether removed from the site or kept on the site but in another location) and the amount of material to be added (whether obtained off-site or obtained elsewhere on the site) shall all be included in the total amount. For example, if one thousand cubic yards of material are to be removed from one side of a lot and relocated to the opposite side of the lot, the total amount of material for purposes of subsection (A) above is two thousand cubic yards (one thousand cubic yards removed + one thousand cubic yards added). 
C.  Any required grading permit shall be issued concurrently with, and not until, the issuance of any building permit required for the same project, construction or work; provided, however, that in the event that pending building permit requirements will not affect proposed grading plans, the city engineer may approve issuance of the grading permit separately from, and in advance of, the issuance of the building permit. 
(Ord. 617 § 1 (part), 2001) 
15.24.040 - Permit-Application and fees.

Chapter 15.30 - TIME LIMITS FOR COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION 
Sections: 

15.30.010 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Construction Completion Chapter." 
(Ord. 658 § 3 (part), 2005) 
15.30.020 - Purpose. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to: 
A.  Assure the safety of construction practices, structures, and other improvements, through encouragement of final inspections on all construction requiring building permits. 
B.  Set and enforce reasonable time limits for the completion of all construction requiring building permits in order to protect property values and prevent the creation of public nuisances. 
(Ord. 658 § 3 (part), 2005) 
15.30.030 - Application. 
    This chapter shall apply to all construction (including, but not limited to, all additions, alterations, modifications, repairs and improvements) that requires a building permit. 
(Ord. 658 § 3 (part), 2005) 
15.30.040 - Construction completion. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, construction shall be complete upon the final performance of all construction work, including, but not necessarily limited to, exterior repairs and remodeling, total compliance with all conditions of application approval, and the clearing and cleaning of all construction-related materials and debris from the site. Final inspection and approval of the construction work by the town shall mark the date of construction completion. Deadlines for the completion of landscaping are set forth in Section 17.56.090. 
(Ord. 658 § 3 (part), 2005) 
15.30.050 - Time limits for construction completion.

(Ord. No. 739, § 4, 7-11-2016) 
15.30.055 - Time extensions for completion of construction. 
    The building official may extend the time for completion set forth in Section 15.30.050 for a period not to exceed ninety days after considering the impact on neighboring residences and the good faith and diligence of the property owner in moving forward with the project. The property owner must apply for the extension at least five business days prior to the expiration of the time limit then in effect. Requests for time extensions for completion of construction are subject to type B public notice as described in Section 1.20.010 of the Code. As a condition of granting an extension for completion of construction, the building official may establish additional requirements for the project to meet to insure compliance with any conditions imposed by the architecture and design review board and, if applicable, by the city council, as well as compliance with all applicable state and federal law and regulations, including, without limitation, stormwater management, recycling, and parking requirements and to address neighborhood impacts. Failure to adhere to such requirements may result in the issuance of a stop work order and shall constitute a nuisance under Chapter 8.16 of the Code. 
    The property owner may apply for additional extensions, but no single extension may be for a period exceeding ninety days. 
(Ord. No. 692, § 2, 9-13-2010; Ord. No. 739, § 4, 7-11-2016) 
15.30.060 - Effect of failure to comply with time limits for construction completion. 
A.  If a property owner fails to complete construction by the applicable time limit established in this chapter, the property owner shall be subject to the following penalties payable to the town: 
Period of time that project remains incomplete beyond applicable time limit Penalty First 30 days 0 31st through 60th day $200.00 per day (i.e., $6,000.00 maximum penalty applicable to this 30-day period) 61st through 120th day $400.00 per day (i.e., $24,000.00 maximum penalty applicable to this 60-day period) 121st day and every day thereafter $1,000.00 per day (no maximum total)  
B.  Penalties, fees and costs due to the town pursuant to this chapter are due each day as the penalties accrue. 
C.  Any violation of this chapter shall constitute a public nuisance and, in addition to being subject to any other remedies allowed by law, may be abated as provided by law. 
(Ord. 658 § 3 (part), 2005) 
15.30.070 - Construction completion deposit. 
A.  Before a building permit may be issued, the property owner or his representative shall deliver to the building department a refundable deposit (in cash or in the form of a payment penalty bond) in the amount of two percent of the estimated value of the work as determined by the chief building official, but not less than five hundred dollars deposit. Any bond shall be in the amount of the deposit and in form and contents satisfactory to the town and shall cover a minimum time period of the applicable time limit plus two years. 
B.  If construction is completed (as defined in Section 15.30.040) by the applicable time limit, the town shall refund the construction completion deposit or return the bond, together with any interest earned thereon. 
C.  If a property owner fails to complete construction by the applicable time limit, the applicable penalties shall accrue daily. 
D.  If the owner believes that the failure to meet the applicable time limit was caused by circumstances beyond the owner's control and those circumstances are among those listed as grounds for appeal in Section 15.30.080(B), the owner may file a written statement to that effect with the chief building official on or before the construction deadline and provide documentation substantiating such grounds of appeal and the effect on the construction. If the owner makes such filing, no part of the deposit shall be forfeited to the town and no demand shall be made against the bond if construction is completed within one year after the applicable time limit. If construction is thus completed and the chief building official concurs with the owner's statement as to the cause of the failure to meet the deadline, the chief building official may waive the penalty and return the cash deposit or bond to the owner. If the chief building official does not concur with the owner's statement, it shall be treated as an appeal under Section 15.30.080 and all the provisions of that section shall apply. 
E.  Except as set subsection D of this section, if construction is completed after the applicable time limit, the town shall draw on the deposit or bond in the amount of the applicable penalties; provided, however, that in the event of an appeal, the town shall not draw on the deposit or bond until the hearing panel has rendered its decision as set forth in Section 15.30.080(C). 
F.  After construction is completed and all applicable fines received by the town, any remaining deposit shall be refunded or the bond shall be returned. 
(Ord. 658 § 3 (part), 2005) 
15.30.080 - Appeal of penalties. 
A.  A penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter may be appealed to a hearing panel, as described in subsection E of this section, on the grounds that the property owner was unable to comply with the applicable time limit for reasons beyond the control of the property owner and the owner's representatives. There shall be no right to appeal until construction is completed. 
B.  The grounds for appeal shall include, but not be limited to, labor stoppages, acts of war or terrorism, and natural disasters, but shall not include delays caused by the winter rainy season, the issuance of any stop work order, the use of custom and/or imported materials, the use of highly specialized subcontractors, significant or numerous or late design changes, site access difficulties, failure of materials suppliers to provide materials in a timely manner, or delays associated with project financing, unless a failure or delay was caused by a labor stoppage, act of war or terrorism or natural disaster. 
C.  The appeal of penalties shall be filed in writing with the building official within ten calendar days from the date of construction completion, with payment of an appeal fee in the amount established from time to time by resolution of the city council. The building official shall notify the appellant in writing of the date of the hearing on the appeal. Such notice shall be sent at least two weeks before the date of the hearing, which shall be held no later than sixty days after the date of filing of the appeal. Notice to persons other than the appellant shall not be required; the hearing shall not be a public hearing. 
D.  At the time the appeal is filed or within two weeks thereafter, the appellant shall submit documentary and other evidence sufficient to establish that design decisions, construction drawings and documents, bids and construction contracts, permit applications, and compliance with all required permit conditions were undertaken in a diligent and timely manner. Documentary evidence shall include dated design contracts, date stamped plans, dated construction contracts and material orders, and proof of timely payment of any deposits or fees required pursuant to any of the foregoing items. The documentary and other evidence shall demonstrate to the hearing panel's satisfaction that construction delays resulted from circumstances fully out of the applicant's control and despite diligent and clearly documented efforts to achieve construction completion within the applicable time limit. Penalties shall not be modified or cancelled unless the evidence required by this subsection is submitted at the time of appeal. 
E.  The hearing panel shall consist of the two persons who are the mayor's appointees to the hearing panel set forth in Section 8.16.050, plus a third person appointed by the building official. The third person shall be knowledgeable in construction matters. 
F.  The hearing panel shall affirm, modify or cancel the penalty based on the evidence submitted pursuant to subsection D of this section. 
(Ord. 658 § 3 (part), 2005) 
15.30.090 - Applicability and enforcement. 
A.  This chapter shall apply to all construction for which a building permit was issued on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
B.  Any penalty due under Section 15.30.070 in excess of the deposit made under Section 15.30.080 shall be a personal debt owned to the town by the property owner(s) and, in addition to all other means of enforcement and collection, shall become a lien against the subject property and shall be subject to the same penalties (including interest thereon at the maximum rate allowed by law from the date the lien attaches until the date of payment) and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes.

Chapter 15.32 - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 720, § 1, adopted March 9, 2015, amended chapter 15.32 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former chapter 15.32, §§ 15.32.010-15.32.190, pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

15.32.010 - Purpose, intent, and application. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to reasonably regulate, to the extent permitted under California and federal law, the installations, operations, collocations, modifications, replacements and removals of various wireless communications facilities ("WCFs") in the town recognizing the benefits of wireless communications while reasonably respecting other important town needs, including the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, aesthetics and local values. 
B.  The overarching intent of this chapter is to make wireless communications reasonably available while preserving the essential rural character of the town. This will be realized by: 
1.  Minimizing the visual and physical effects of WCFs through appropriate design, siting, screening techniques and location standards; 
2.  Encouraging the installation of WCFs at locations where other such facilities already exist; and 
3.  Encouraging the installation of such facilities where and in a manner such that potential adverse impacts to the town are minimized. 
C.  To allow the town to better preserve the established rural character of the town, it is the intent to limit the duration of WCF permits, in most cases, to terms of ten years, and to reevaluate existing WCFs at the end of each term. 
D.  It is not the purpose or intent of this chapter to: 
1.  Prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting wireless communications services; or 
2.  Unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communications services; or 
3.  Regulate the placement, construction or modification of WCFs on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency ("RF") emissions where it is demonstrated that the WCF does or will comply with the applicable FCC regulations; or 
4.  Prohibit or effectively prohibit collocations or modifications that the town must approve under state or federal law. 
E.  The provisions in this chapter shall apply to all permit applications to install, operate or change, including, without limitation, to collocate, modify, replace or remove, any new or existing wireless tower or base station within the town. This chapter does not apply to WCFs owned by or exclusively operated for government agencies, amateur radio stations, satellite dish or other television antennas or other OTARD Antennas, or towers as defined and governed by Chapter 15.36, except to the extent that such towers may be used to support WCFs. 
F.  Nothing in this chapter is intended to allow the town to preempt any state or federal law or regulation applicable to a WCF. 
G.  The provisions of this chapter are in addition to, and do not replace, any obligations a WCF permit holder may have under any franchises, licenses, or other permits issued by the town. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016) 
15.32.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, certain terms shall have meanings as follows:

    "Base station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as follows: 
    "A structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables [FCC]-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in [47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(9)] or any equipment associated with a tower." 
(i)  The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul. 
(ii)  The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems and small-cell networks). 
(iii)  The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under this section, supports or houses equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (ii) of this section that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support. 
(iv)  The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the state or local government under this section, does not support or house equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-(ii) of this section. 
    As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC's definition refers to any structure that actually supports wireless equipment even though it was not originally intended for that purpose. Examples include, but are not limited to, wireless facilities mounted on buildings, utility poles and transmission towers, light standards or traffic signals. A structure without wireless equipment replaced with a new one designed to bear the additional weight from wireless equipment constitutes a base station. 
    "Building and planning director" means the Town of Hillsborough's director of the building and planning department or his or her designee. 
    "Camouflaged or concealed WCF" means a wireless communications facility that (i) is integrated as an architectural feature of an existing structure such as (but not limited to) a cupola, or (ii) is integrated in an outdoor fixture such as (but not limited to) a flagpole; or (iii) uses a design which mimics and is consistent with nearby natural, or architectural features, or is incorporated into or replaces existing permitted facilities (including but not limited to stop signs or other traffic signs or freestanding light standards) so that the presence of the WCF is not readily apparent.

1.  Granting the application would not create a safety hazard, whether from wind loading, stress on the support structure or wireless tower, or in any other manner; 
2.  Granting the application would not intrude upon or additionally burden any environmentally sensitive area, or incommode the public in its use of any rights-of-way; 
3.  The application would not alter the visible size of any structure or outdoor fixture to which the transmission equipment is attached; 
4.  The application would not result in any visible transmission equipment from any publicly accessible spaces; and 
5.  The application would not result in an alteration of a structure or support structure otherwise inconsistent with the Code. 
    "Monopole" means a single freestanding pole used to act as or support an externally mounted antenna or antenna arrays. 
    "OTARD antennas" means antennas covered by the "over-the-air reception devices" rule in 47 C.F.R. sections 1.4000 et seq. as may be amended or replaced from time to time. 
    "Outdoor fixture" has the same meaning as "outdoor fixture" under Section 12.12.010 of this Code. 
    "Public property" means property owned or under the control of the town and specifically excludes the town's rights-of-way. By way of example and not limitation, public property includes structures and outdoor fixtures owned by the town. 
    "Public works director" means the director of public works of the town or his or her designee. 
    "Radome" means a visually-opaque, radio frequency transparent enclosure which may contain transmission equipment. 
    "Rights-of-way" refers to public streets and rights-of-way, as those terms are defined in Section 1.04.010(K) and Section 17.08.220 of this Code. 
    "Section 6409(a) modification" means a collocation or modification of transmission equipment at an existing wireless tower or base station that does not result in a substantial change in the physical dimensions of the existing wireless tower or base station. For the purposes of a Section 6409(a) modification, the term "substantial change" means: 
1.  For wireless towers outside the public right-of-way, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty feet (whichever is greater); or 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than twenty feet from the edge of the wireless tower or the width of the wireless tower at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or 
c.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or 
d.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site. 
2.  For wireless towers within the public right-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet (whichever is greater); or 
b.  the proposed collocation or modification increases the width more than six feet from the edge of the wireless tower or base station; or 
c.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four; or 
d.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or 
e.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment cabinets that are ten percent larger in height or volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets; or 
f.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground. 
3.  For all proposed collocations and modifications, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification involves more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four equipment cabinets; 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the concealment elements of the support structure; or 
c.  The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section. 
    The thresholds and conditions for a "substantial change" described in this section are disjunctive-the violation of any individual threshold or condition results in a substantial change. The height and width thresholds for a substantial change described in this section are cumulative for each individual wireless tower or base station. The cumulative limit is measured from the physical dimensions of the original structure for base stations and all sites in the public rights-of-way, and from the smallest physical dimensions that existed on or after February 22, 2012, for wireless towers on private property. 
    "Small WCFs" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.6002(l) as may be amended, which are personal wireless services facilities that meet the following conditions that, solely for convenience, have been set forth below: 
1.  The facilities: 
a.  Are mounted on structures fifty feet or less in height, including antennas, as defined in 47 C.F.R. § 1.1320(d), or 
b.  Are mounted on structures no more than ten percent taller than other adjacent structures, or 
c.  Do not extend existing structures on which they are located to a height of more than fifty feet or by more than ten percent, whichever is greater; 
2.  Each antenna associated with the deployment, excluding associated antenna equipment (as defined in the definition of antenna in 47 C.F.R. § 1.1320(d)), is no more than three cubic feet in volume; 
3.  All other wireless equipment associated with the structure, including the wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any pre-existing associated equipment on the structure, is no more than twenty-eight cubic feet in volume; 
4.  The facility does not require antenna structure registration under 47 C.F.R. Part 17; 
5.  The facility is not located on Tribal lands, as defined under 36 C.F.R. § 800.16(x); and 
6.  The facility does not result in human exposure to radiofrequency radiation in excess of the applicable safety standards specified in 47 C.F.R. § 1.1307(b). 
    "Structure" has the same meaning as "structure" under Section 17.08.270 of this code but for purposes of this chapter does not include utility poles or towers as defined in Chapter 15.36. 
    "Support equipment" means the physical, electrical and/or electronic equipment included within a wireless communications facility used to house, power, and/or process signals from or to the antenna or antennas but specifically excluding the base station. 
    "Support structure(s)" means a structure, outdoor fixture, tower as defined in Chapter 15.36, or utility pole capable of safely supporting a WCF, but does not necessarily include a wireless tower or base station. 
    "Town" means the Town of Hillsborough, California. 
    "Transmission equipment" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that terms as "[e]quipment that facilitates transmission for any [FCC]-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services included, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul." 
    "Utility pole" means a steel or wood pole or structure located in the rights-of-way and dedicated to use by multiple utilities and providers of communications franchised by the state or town. A wireless tower is not a utility pole. 
    "Whip antenna" means an omni-directional antenna. 
    "Wireless" means any FCC licensed or authorized communication service transmitted over frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum. 
    "Wireless communications facility" or "WCF" means a facility used to "provide personal wireless services" as defined at 47 U.S.C. section 332(c)(7)(C); or wireless information services provided to the public or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public via licensed or unlicensed frequencies; or wireless utility monitoring and control services; or any other FCC licensed or authorized service. A WCF does not include a facility entirely enclosed within a permitted building outside of the rights-of-way where the installation does not require a modification of the exterior of the building; nor does it include a device attached to a building, used for serving that building only and that is otherwise permitted under other provisions of the Code. A WCF consists of an antenna or antennas, including, but not limited to, directional, omni-directional and parabolic antennas, base station, support equipment, and (if applicable) a wireless tower. It does not include the support structure to which the WCF or its components is attached. The term does not include mobile transmitting devices used by wireless service subscribers, such as vehicle or hand held radios/telephones and their associated transmitting antennas, nor does it include other facilities specifically excluded from the coverage of this chapter. 
    "Wireless tower" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended, which defines that terms as "[a]ny structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting [FCC]-licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site." Examples include, but are not limited to, monopoles, mono-trees and lattice towers. This does not include structures that were installed to replace or collocate upon existing power poles, light poles, energy transmission towers, or buildings. A support structure which is modified or replaced to allow for the installation of transmission equipment retains its prior use as its primary use, and the wireless use is only a secondary use thereof, even if the transmission equipment is the only attachment to the support structure.

C.  A permit shall not be effective and shall not authorize installation, collocation or modification of any WCF or installation or modification of a support structure or wireless tower unless the conditions of this paragraph are satisfied. A permit may be revoked prior to its effective date. 
1.  Applicant must obtain all other required permits, authorizations, approvals or declarations that may be required for installation or modification of the WCF or for installation or modification of the support structure under federal, state or local law, including but not limited to building permits, CEQA declarations, or FCC approvals. A WCF permit is not in lieu of any other permit required under the Code, except as specifically provided herein, nor is it a franchise, license or other authorization to occupy the rights-of-way, or a license, lease or agreement authorizing occupancy of any other private or public property. It does not create a vested right in occupying any particular location, and a permittee may be required to move and remove facilities at its expense consistent with other provisions of applicable law. 
2.  Applicant must provide proof to the town that it has obtained all insurance and/or security required by the Code, and must pay any fees owed to the town. 
D.  A permit issued in error, based on incomplete or false information submitted by an applicant or that conflicts with the provisions of this chapter is not valid. 
E.  The applicant shall submit an application as specified in Section 15.32.050 together with a deposit, estimated by the city manager, to cover the town's application processing costs. 
F.  Where the tendered deposit has been consumed in the processing of the application, the city manager may require the applicant to promptly tender additional deposit(s). 
G.  The applicant shall also deposit with the town the amount estimated to pay for any compliance report required under Section 15.32.100 of this chapter. 
H.  If required by the city manager the applicant shall deposit with the town funds sufficient to reimburse the town for third-party review of an application, and any supplemental deposit required by the city manager for the completion of the third-party review of the application and/or the third-party reviewer providing testimony before the town regarding the application. 
I.  Upon the approval, denial, or termination of the application any unexpended portion of the deposits shall be returned to the applicant. If the deposits did not cover the town's costs, the town will charge the applicant therefore, and in the event of an approval of the WCF the town shall not issue the permit until such charge is fully paid. 
J.  Two pre-application meetings with town staff are recommended for WCFs. The first meeting should take place at the earliest stage of site location research and should include a service area map and description of the type of WCF sought. The second meeting should take place after the site is selected and should include a preliminary site plan and visual impact drawings. These meetings are voluntary. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016) 
15.32.050 - Application required; contents of permit application. 
A.  In all cases an applicant for a WCF permit shall utilize the form of application required by the town. The city manager is authorized to prepare forms of application, and may develop forms of application that distinguish between different types of installations and modifications in order to streamline processing of applications, and to comply with legal requirements. The city manager may also from time to time require additional application materials and/or information in any publicly-stated format. 
B.  An applicant shall tender a WCF permit application and any revisions thereto by appointment only. Applicants may submit one application per appointment but may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible as determined by the town. The town shall ensure that applicant's appointments are scheduled no later than five business days following the applicant's request. 
C.  At a minimum, an application for a WCF permit must include the following information: 
1.  The name and contact information of the entity or entities that will own, and be responsible for the installation and maintenance of the WCF and any support structure installed as part of the installation of the WCF; 
2.  A written and technically accurate and reliable narrative explaining the nature of the permit sought (new installation, modification of existing installation, minor WCF, small WCF, Section 6409(a) modification or other modification); the authorizations required for the installation, collocation or modification, and steps that applicant has taken to comply with the code; 
3.  Documentation of all current and proposed radio frequency emissions from the WCF shall be provided on the form found in Appendix A of the FCC publication, "A Local Government Official's Guide to Transmitting Antenna RF Emission Safety: Rules, Procedures, and Practical Guidance" dated June 2, 2000 (the "Guidance"), or on a form that contains all of the same information as in Appendix A of the Guidance, or on a form or in a manner promulgated by the FCC; 
4.  Information regarding the ownership of the property and support structure or wireless tower on which the WCF will be located, showing applicant has authorization from the owner(s) of the property and/or support structure or wireless tower to pursue the WCF application; 
5.  Information showing applicant has authorization from the owner(s) of the support structure or wireless tower to place its proposed WCF on the support structure or wireless tower, including all structural, windloading and other safety analyses performed to determine whether (and, if applicable, with what modifications or replacements) the support structure or wireless tower can safely support the proposed WCF in compliance with CPUC General Order 95 and General Order 128, and/or other applicable building and safety standards, as they may be amended or replaced; 
6.  Any CEQA-related determinations with respect to the proposed collocation, modification or installation; 
7.  For installations in the rights-of-way, written evidence of a franchise, license or similar authorization from the town or the state that entitles the applicant to occupy the rights-of-way; 
8.  Materials needed for the town to provide notice of the application to all owners of real property in the vicinity of the proposed WCF location as provided in Section 15.32.060.B. These materials shall be in the form and include the content that the city manager may from time-to-time require in any publicly stated format, but at a minimum must include a plain language description and photosimulations or illustrations of the proposed WCF; 
9.  A photo image of the storyboard proposed to meet the requirements of Section 15.32.060.E; and 
10.  Any other information or materials that the city manager may from time-to-time require in any publicly stated format. 
D.  Where a WCF is part of a network of WCFs that will be installed contemporaneously or sequentially, such as a distributed antenna system or DAS, the applications for each of the facilities in the proposed network shall be submitted simultaneously. 
E.  To promote efficient review and timely decisions, an application will be automatically deemed withdrawn when an applicant fails to tender a substantive response within sixty days after the town deems the application incomplete as set forth in a written notice to the applicant. The city manager may in the city manager's discretion grant a written extension for up to an additional thirty days upon a written request for an extension received prior to the sixtieth day. The city manager may grant further written extensions only for good cause, which includes circumstances outside the applicant's reasonable control. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 751, § 9, 1-14-2019; Ord. No. 754, § 8, 2-11-2019) 
15.32.060 - Review of permit application; noticing. 
A.  The city manager shall review all WCF permit applications for completeness and compliance with the provisions of this chapter and other applicable laws and regulations. Generally, the city manager will designate the public works director to be lead reviewer for applications for placement and/or modification of WCFs in the rights-of-way, and will designate the building and planning director to be lead reviewer for applications for placement and/or modification of WCFs on private property and public property. 
B.  No more than three business days after the WCF permit application has been submitted to the city manager with complete noticing materials as required by this code, a type A notice (as described in Chapter 1.20 of this code) of the WCF shall be provided by the town to all owners of real property any part of which is located within five hundred feet of the real property, or if the WCF is to be located in the town's rights-of-way within five hundred feet of the proposed WCF location. If the city manager determines that certain different types of proposed WCF installations and modifications should be subject to broader notice requirements, the city manager may increase the notice radius by specifying the broader notice requirement in the WCF permit application form prepared pursuant to Section 15.32.050. 
C.  Notwithstanding the above, for a minor WCF, a Section 6409(a) modification, or for modifications of facilities in the rights-of-way, a type B notice (as described in Chapter 1.20 of this code) shall be provided to all owners of real property any part of which is located adjacent to the real property upon which the WCF is located, or if the WCF is to be located in the town's rights-of-way to owners of real property any part of which is located adjacent to the WCF location. 
D.  No more than thirty days but not less than twenty-five days before the date the applicant believes the applicable timeframe for review expires, the applicant must provide notice to all persons entitled to notice in accordance with code Section 15.32.060, as modified in this subsection D. The provisions in this subsection do not apply to Section 6409(a) modifications or small WCF applications. 
1.  The notice must contain the following statement: "California Government Code section 65964.1 may deem the application approved in thirty days unless the Town approves or disapproves the application, or the Town and applicant reach a mutual tolling agreement." 
2.  In addition to all persons entitled to notice in accordance with this code Section 15.32.060, the applicant must deliver written notice to the city manager, which contains the same statement required in subsection D.1., above, and a mailing list for public notices sent out under this subsection (B). The applicant may tender such notice in person or by certified United States mail. 
E.  No more than two business days after filing an application for a WCF permit, the applicant must post a storyboard at the proposed WCF location that does not interfere with local traffic or use of the public right-of-way and consists of a color image of the proposed WCF, printed on a weatherproof material and mounted on a wood frame. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 751, §§ 10-12, 1-14-2019; Ord. No. 754, §§ 9-11, 2-11-2019) 
15.32.070 - Design standards. 
A.  The purpose of this section is to identify preferences and requirements for the location and design of WCFs, to provide guidance to prospective applicants as they seek appropriate WCF locations within the town, and to provide guidance to the city manager in determining whether to grant, grant with conditions, or to deny a WCF application. 
B.  This section applies to all new WCFs and to all collocations and modifications to existing WCFs, except collocations and modifications to existing WCFs that qualify as a Section 6409(a) modification. 
C.  The location for a WCF should take into consideration the following preference order (with (1) being the highest preference): 
1.  Public property; 
2.  Existing utility poles (with poles without electric distribution lines being favored over poles supporting electric distribution lines); or other support structures or wireless towers where collocation has been pre-approved (where the application is consistent with the pre-approval); 
3.  Existing support structures or wireless towers on nonresidential private property; and 
4.  New concealed WCF in the rights-of-way or on private property. 
D.  The city council shall adopt design and development standards for WCFs, consistent with the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 751, § 13, 1-14-2019; Ord. No. 754, § 12, 2-11-2019) 
15.32.080 - Approval or disapproval of an application. 
A.  The city manager may approve or conditionally approve an application only after: 
1.  The application is deemed complete; 
2.  At least fifteen days has elapsed from the postmark date required under Section 15.32.060.B. or C. of this chapter (if applicable); and 
3.  Any action required under Section 2.12.070 has been taken. 
B.  The city manager may disapprove an application in any of the following instances: 
1.  The applicant has not shown that the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter; or 
2.  The applicant has failed to submit any additional information requested by the city manager by the due date specified by the city manager; or 
3.  The applicant has not provided to the town all of the required information required by this chapter to permit the city manager to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application taking into account legal deadlines affecting the town's consideration of the application. 
C.  It is the applicant's burden to show that a permit should be granted. In reviewing an application, the city manager may consider the WCF as proposed, and as it may be modified as a matter of right should the application be granted. In determining whether to grant, deny or condition an application, the city manager may consider the following and such other matters as the city manager may be entitled or required to consider as a matter of law: 
1.  Except as to Section 6409(a) modifications, whether the WCF and support structure additions and modifications proposed are consistent with the general plan and will not adversely affect the policies and goals set forth therein or alter the rural character of the community; 
2.  Except as to minor WCFs, Section 6409(a) modifications or where the town is prohibited from considering it by law, whether the applicant has shown that denial of the proposed WCF would result in an effective prohibition of personal wireless services or telecommunications services, or that denial is otherwise preempted by state or federal law; 
3.  Except as to Section 6409(a) modifications, whether the WCF and support structure modifications and additions proposed, comply with the design standards herein, and other applicable provisions of the code and in applicable city council resolutions; 
4.  Whether the WCF and support structure modifications and additions proposed comply with applicable safety codes and laws (including without limitation the ADA); 
5.  Except as to Section 6409(a) modifications, whether the WCF and support structure modifications and additions interfere with the public's use of rights-of-way, or create undue risks to persons or property; 
6.  Whether the applicant has made the required affirmation regarding compliance with the FCC's RF regulations, as the same may be amended; 
7.  Whether the applicant is authorized to file the application; 
8.  Whether the applicant has or will have necessary local, state or federal regulatory approvals required in connection with the WCF (including but not limited to necessary CEQA approvals, if any; and approvals for utility box design under this Code, or for structures on private property under Section 2.12); and 
9.  Except as to Section 6409(a) modifications, whether alternative designs or locations would be more consistent with the general plan and otherwise minimize the impact of the WCF and support structure modifications and additions required. 
D.  If the city manager determines that an application should be approved, denied, or should be conditionally approved, he or she shall make written findings referencing substantial evidence in the town's written administrative record in support of the action. The applicant and each owner of real property who was entitled to notice of the application as provided in Section 15.32.060.B. shall receive a copy of the town's written decision and findings with respect to the decision. Such copy shall also plainly state the process and deadline for filing an appeal to the city council. Unless timely appealed, the decision will be final except as provided in Sections 15.32.040.C. and 15.32.080.E. herein. 
E.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the city manager may recommend to the city council that, notwithstanding the evidence supporting denial, an application be approved if he or she makes a finding that the applicant has demonstrated that the refusal to grant such an exception and approve the application would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. section 332(c)(7), or finds that the town authority to deny the application is otherwise preempted or prohibited by state or federal law. If a recommendation is made under this provision, the recommendation will be promptly submitted to the city council for final determination. 
F.  A WCF located on private property shall also be subject to the provisions of Chapter 2.12 of this code to the extent that it involves a modification to a support structure which is also subject to review under the provisions of Chapter 2.12. 
G.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following provisions shall apply to Section 6409(a) modifications: 
1.  Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), the city manager may not deny a Section 6409(a) modification except when: 
a.  The collocation or modification would result in a substantial change (see "Section 6409(a) modification," defined in Section 15.32.020, pg. 316) to the existing wireless tower or base station; 
b.  The collocation or modification would violate any applicable building code, electrical code, structural code, fire code or any other law, regulation, rule or prior condition of approval based on objective factors and reasonably related to public health and safety; 
c.  The collocation or modification involves the replacement of the wireless tower or other support structure; or 
d.  47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a) does not apply to the collocation or modification for any lawful reason. 
2.  Any denial of a Section 6409(a) modification shall be without prejudice. Subject to subsection G.3. below, the applicant may submit the same or substantially the same permit application, together with all required fees and deposits, for either a WCF permit or a Section 6409(a) modification permit. 
3.  The town shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs for its review of any Section 6409(a) modification permit application, whether approved, deemed granted or denied without prejudice. In the event that the city manager denies a Section 6409(a) permit, the town shall return any unused deposit fees within sixty days after a written request from the applicant. If the fees in the deposit account do not cover the reasonable cost for the town's review, an applicant shall not be allowed to submit an application for the same or substantially the same change unless all fees for the prior-denied permit application are paid in full. 
H.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following provisions shall apply to small WCFs: 
1.  The city manager shall approve an application if, on the basis of the application and other materials or evidence provided in review thereof, it finds the following: 
a.  The facility is not detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; 
b.  The facility complies with this chapter and all applicable design and development standards; and 
c.  The facility meets applicable requirements and standards of state and federal law. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 751, §§ 14-18, 1-14-2019; Ord. No. 754, §§ 13-17, 2-11-2019) 
15.32.090 - Appeal to city council. 
A.  Within fifteen calendar days following the date of the city manager's written decision on the WCF application or within seven days for WCF applications for small WCFs or EFRs, any person or entity may appeal the decision to the city council. 
B.  Where an appeal is timely filed, the city manager shall prepare a staff report regarding the original decision and shall submit the report to the city council along with the written notice of appeal submitted by the appellant. 
C.  The appeal before the city council shall be a public hearing and shall be noticed as set forth in Section 1.20.010.A. of this Code; provided, however, that the mailing list of persons to whom the permit application is sent shall be governed by Section 15.32.060.B. or C. of this chapter instead of the type A or type B notice mailing list described in Section 1.20.010 of this Code and provided further that the appellant shall be deemed the person requesting the public hearing for purposes of Section 1.20.010.A.3. of this Code. The appellant shall bear all costs for the appeal. In all other cases not described herein, a type B notice of the appeal shall be mailed consistent with this section. 
D.  The city council shall hear the appeal at the next regular city council meeting after allowing for sufficient time for the city manager to prepare the written report. To prevent applicants from withholding information or otherwise abusing the appeal process, the city council has the discretion but is not required to hear additional evidence, and may decide the matter solely on the record that was before the city manager. 
E.  The city council may accept or reject, wholly or in part, or may modify, the decision or any recommendations made by the city manager. If the decision of the city council regarding the WCF appeal is to deny the WCF or conditionally approve the WCF, the city council shall direct the manager to prepare written finding(s) referencing substantial evidence in the town's written administrative record and such writing finding shall be provided to the city council for adoption. The applicant and any appellant on the application shall receive a copy of the final written decision approved by the city council. 
F.  The city council may also remand the application to the building and planning director or public works director for further consideration with such instructions as the city council deems appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 751, §§ 19-21, 1-14-2019; Ord. No. 754, §§ 18-20, 2-11-2019) 
15.32.100 - Standard conditions. 
    All WCF permits, whether approved in accordance with this code or deemed approved or deemed granted by the operation of law, shall be subject to the standard conditions of approval provided in the city council resolution which may add, remove or modify any conditions of approval as necessary or appropriate to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 751, §§ 22-24, 1-14-2019; Ord. No. 754, § 21-23, 2-11-2019)

15.32.110 - Modification of a WCF permit. 
A.  The town may modify a permit before its termination date where necessary to protect public health and safety, or where the permit as issued is no longer enforceable in accordance with its terms. 
B.  A permit holder may modify a permit by seeking either a Section 6409(a) modification or other modification. Modifications other than Section 6409(a) modifications shall be treated the same as requests for a new WCF. 
C.  Requests for modifications will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of the Code at the time modification is sought, and not at the time the permit initially issued. 
(Ord. No. 720, § 1, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 738, § 1, 7-11-2016; Ord. No. 751, § 26, 1-14-2019; Ord. No. 754, § 25, 2-11-2019)

15.32.120 - Revocation of a WCF permit. 
A.  A WCF permit may be revoked if permittee is not in compliance with permit conditions, if the permit conditions are not enforceable, or for a failure to comply with any provision of the Code relating to the permit, or relating to the WCF associated with the permit ("default event"). By way of example and not limitation, a refusal to timely remove facilities located in the rights-of-way where required in connection with a public works project would be a default event. 
B.  The city manager may revoke a WCF permit only after: 
1.  Written notice of the default event has been provided to the WCF permit holder; 
2.  The WCF permit holder has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to cure and comply with its permit, or demonstrate that no default event occurred. 
C.  If the WCF permit holder fails to cure, the city council or the city council through a designee shall conduct a noticed public hearing where the WCF permit holder shall be afforded an opportunity to speak and be heard and to provide written material prior to the hearing. If the city council, after the public hearing, finds that the WCF or the WCF permit holder has violated any law regulating the WCF or has failed to comply with the requirements of this chapter, the WCF permit, any applicable agreement or any condition of approval the city council may revoke the permit. 
D.  Upon revocation, the city council may require the removal of the WCF or take any other legally permissible action or combination of actions necessary to protect the health and welfare of the town.

Chapter 15.44 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT 
Sections: 

15.44.010 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
A.  "Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
B.  "Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. 
C.  "Apex" means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front. 
D.  "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
E.  "Area of special flood hazard." See "Special flood hazard area." 
F.  "Base flood" means a flood which has one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one-hundred-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
G.  "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (i.e., below ground level) on all sides. 
H.  "Building." See "Structure." 
I.  "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
J.  "Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter capacity of a floodplain. 
K.  "Flood, flooding or flood water" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
L.  "Flood Hazard Boundary Map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
M.  "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
N.  "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
O.  "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding." 
P.  "Floodplain administrator" is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
Q.  "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plan, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
R.  "Floodplain management regulations" means the provisions of this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
S.  "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and the their contents. 
T.  "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "Regulatory floodway." 
U.  "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "Regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
V.  "Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.44.050 (Variance procedure) of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on, or victimization of, the public. In examining this requirement, the town shall consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that any such increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
W.  "Governing body" is the town, which is the local governing unit empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
X.  "Hardship" as related to Section 15.44.050 (Variance procedure) of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The town requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
Y.  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
Z.  "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs. 
AA.  "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
BB.  "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
CC.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet floodproofing standards in Section 15.44.040(A)(3)(c) of this Chapter; 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.44.040(A)(1) of this chapter; 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.44.040(A)(2) of this chapter; 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.44.040(B). 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
DD.  "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
EE.  "New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
FF.  "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
GG.  "One hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood." See "Base flood." 
HH.  "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 15.44.050 (Variances) of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
II.  "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
JJ.  "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
KK.  "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
LL.  "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area having special flood hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, A1-A30, AE, A99 or M. 
MM.  "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footing, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
NN.  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
OO.  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its pre-damage condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
PP.  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
QQ.  "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
RR.  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
SS.  "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
TT.  "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(Ord. 592 § 5 (part), 1999) 
15.44.020 - General provisions. 
A.  This chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the town.

This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the town, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. 592 § 5 (part), 1999) 
(Ord. No. 715, § 8, 6-9-2014) 
15.44.030 - Administration. 
A.  A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 15.44.020 B. of this chapter. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimension, and elevation of the areas in question, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
1.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 
2.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed, if required by Section 15.44.040 A.3.c. of this chapter; 
3.  All appropriate certifications listed in Section 15.44.030 C.4. of this chapter; and 
4.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

15.44.040 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required: 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic or hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed: 
a.  With materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
b.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and 
c.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
3.  For elevation and floodproofing, see Section 15.44.010 definitions for "basement," "lowest floor," "new construction," "substantial damage," and "substantial improvement." 
a.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot above the base flood elevation, as determined by the community. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the town's building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
b.  Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with Section 15.44.040 A.3.a. of this chapter or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
i.  Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under Section 15.44.040 A.3.a. so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
ii.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
iii.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this section 15.44.040 A.3.b. are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
c.  All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designated automatically to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or 
ii.  Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
4.  Garages and low cost accessory structures. 
a.  Attached garages. 
i.  A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the Base Flood Elevation, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of flood waters. Areas of the garage below the base flood elevation must be constructed with flood resistant materials. See Section 15.44.040 A.2. 
ii.  A garage attached to a nonresidential structure must meet the above requirements or be dry floodproofed pursuant to applicable FEMA requirements. 
b.  Detached garages and accessory structures. 
i.  "Accessory structures," as defined by FEMA, used solely for parking (two-car detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low cost sheds as defined by FEMA) may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood elevation (BFE), provided the structure is designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements: 
a)  Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking or limited storage; 
b)  The portions of the accessory structure located below the base flood elevation must be built using flood-resistant materials; 
c)  The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement; 
d)  Any mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory structure must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the base flood elevation; 
e)  The accessory structure must comply with floodplain encroachment provisions; and 
f)  The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of flood waters. 
ii.  Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in Section 15.04.040 of this chapter. 
B.  Standards for utilities shall be as follows: 
1.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designated to minimize or eliminate: 
a.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
b.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters; 
2.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
C.  Standards for subdivisions shall be as follows: 
1.  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
2.  All subdivision plans shall provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
4.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
5.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
D.  Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.44.020B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
1.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  If Section 15.44.040(D)(1) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.44.040. 
(Ord. 592 § 5 (part), 1999) 
(Ord. No. 715, § 8, 6-9-2014) 
15.44.050 - Variance procedure. 
A.  The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. It is the duty of the town to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B.  In passing upon requests for variances, the town shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter. 
1.  In addition, the town shall consider the following specific factors: 
a.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
d.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
k.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
2.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
3.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
C.  The conditions for granting variances hereunder are as follows: 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.44.030 and 15.44.040 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required to issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.44.010 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the town need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the town believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinances. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 15.44.010 of this ordinance) to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.44.010 of this chapter, see "Public safety or nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.44.010 of this chapter) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.44.050(C)(1) through 15.44.050(C)(5) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
7.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.44.050(B)(1) and the purposes of this chapter, the town may attached such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
D.  The issuance of a variance under this section is for floodplain management purposes only.

A.  By posting notice thereof not less than fifteen days before the day of hearing upon the three official bulletin boards of the town and on the subject lot or parcel and by mailing notice to all adjoining lot owners who own land within a distance of five hundred feet from any boundary of the subject lot or parcel. If any property within such five hundred-foot distance is also owned by the applicant and is contiguous with the lot or parcel which is the subject of the application, such contiguous property shall be deemed part of the subject plot or parcel only for purposes of the five hundred-foot distance measurement, and notice shall be mailed to all adjoining lot owners who own land within a distance of five hundred feet from any boundary of such augmented lot or parcel as described above. Such notice shall briefly describe the requested partial or complete demolition. 
B.  The city manager, or designee, in his or her discretion may direct that such notice shall also be published one or more times in a newspaper of general circulation within the town, the first publication to be not less than fifteen days before the day of the hearing, if it is deemed that the requested demolition is of sufficiently broad interest or impact to warrant such additional notice. 
C.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, when, pursuant to the terms hereof, notice is required to be given to owners of lots located outside the town's limits, but only with respect to such owners, notice of the above-described hearing shall be given by mailing notice to all property owners of land within a distance of three hundred feet from any boundary of the subject lot or parcel. If any property within such three hundred-foot distance is also owned by the applicant and is contiguous with the lot or parcel which is the subject of the application, such contiguous property shall be deemed part of the subject lot or parcel only for purposes of the three hundred-foot distance measurement, and notice shall be mailed to all property owners of land within a distance of three hundred feet from any boundary of such augmented lot or parcel as described above. Such notice shall briefly describe the requested partial or complete demolition. 
(Ord. 558 § 2 (part), 1997) 
15.70.070 - Historic structure-Issuance of historic structure demolition permit. 
A.  The city council may issue a historic structure demolition permit for complete or partial demolition of a historic structure, conditionally or unconditionally, only upon finding that: 
1.  All necessary approvals by the town for a project or replacement structure (except for issuance of a building permit or permits) have been obtained for the subject property, including but not limited to approval by the architecture and design review board and pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act; 
2.  Demolition would provide a greater benefit to the community than maintenance of the existing structure; and 
3.  All other applicable local, state and federal laws, standards and regulations, including but not limited to provisions of the Uniform Building Code, California State Historical Building Code, Regional Air Quality Act and the California Environmental Quality Act have been, or will be, met, and all necessary findings thereunder have been made. 
B.  The city council may also consider any or all of the following (without necessarily making any findings with respect thereto): 
1.  Whether the historic structure was allowed to deteriorate due to either intentional or negligent acts or omissions designed to create a health or safety issue; 
2.  Whether efforts were made to preserve the structure, the availability of private or public sources of grants for building restoration and the economic feasibility of maintaining the historic structure; and 
3.  Whether applicable health and safety requirements can be feasibly met if the historic structure is not demolished. 
(Ord. 558 § 2 (part), 1997) 
15.70.080 - Economic hardship-Exception. 
    A written application to the city council for a certificate of economic hardship may be submitted, on the forms provided for such purpose, with the city clerk after denial of a historic structure demolition permit. It shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, determined from time to time by the city council to be a reasonable fee for covering the actual costs of processing such an application, including the costs of giving notice. A public hearing concerning the application shall be scheduled and notice of the subject of the hearing given to the persons and in the manner specified in Section 15.70.060. The city council shall review all the information required of the applicant together with all other relevant information before it and make a determination whether the denial of a historic structure demolition permit has deprived, or will deprive, the owner of the property of all reasonable use of, or economic return on, the subject property. A written determination, together with the city council's findings, shall be made denying or approving a certificate of economic hardship. Issuance of such a certificate shall permit the applicant to re-submit an application for a historic structure demolition permit, together with the certificate of economic hardship, for consideration. Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, such a certificate may permit issuance of a historic structure demolition permit without finding that every condition of Section 15.70.070 has been satisfied.

16.04.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this title is the establishment of standards for the design and improvement of private developments and the acceptance, dedication, and improvements of public lands. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.04.020 - Reserved. 
16.04.030 - Subdivision defined. 
    All changes to the size, area, and dimensions of any established lot, parcel, or acreage of land in the town, which results in dividing, splitting, and/or partitioning (but not including lot line adjustments, which are subject to Chapter 16.36) shall constitute a subdivision as the terms is used in this Code. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.04.040 - Control of the Subdivision Map Act. 
A.  All subdivisions of land wholly or partially within the town, including, but not limited to, their design and improvement, the division of any lot into two or more lots or building sites, and the preparation of subdivision maps, shall be governed by the Subdivision Map Act. In the event the Subdivision Map Act is amended, such amendments shall be deemed to be incorporated in this chapter and shall apply to all subsequent applications under this Title 16. 
B.  Subdivisions of land shall also be subject to the provisions of this Title 16 and such additional regulations, standards, specifications, and policies that are specified by the city engineer or the director of building and planning, provided that such additional requirements are consistent with the Subdivision Map Act. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.04.050 - NPDES best management practices. 
    All activities undertaken pursuant to this title shall comply with the current NPDES (National Pollutant Discharge Elation System) permit under which the town operates (the terms of which permit are incorporated herein by reference) and with any amendment, revisions, or reissuance thereof. The current NPDES permit is on file in the office of the city clerk. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all subdividers shall follow the NPDES best management practices (as those are determined from time to time by the Regional Water Quality Control Board) with respect to all work done in any subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.04.060 - Amendments to Title 16. 
    Any amendment made to this title shall not apply to any tentative map, final map, or any other subdivision application submitted and declared complete prior to the effective date of the amendment. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.04.070 - Meaning of street. 
    The word "street" is defined in Section 1.04.010 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
Chapter 16.08 - MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND FRONTAGE 

16.08.010 - Minimum lot size. 
    The minimum net lot area for any lot in town is twenty-one thousand seven hundred eighty square feet, i.e., one-half acre, except as otherwise provided in Chapter 16.12. The net lot area means the gross lot area less the area occupied by any public street easement or private easement for driveway purposes. However, frontage and other requirements of this and other titles may increase the minimum lot size otherwise applicable to a given lot. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to make such other requirements inapplicable. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.08.020 - Minimum frontage. 
A.  Each lot shall have a minimum of one hundred fifty feet of continuous frontage on a public street except as set forth in subsections (B), (C), and (D) of this section. 
B.  For any lot located at the intersection of two or more public streets, the minimum continuous frontage on each public street shall be one hundred feet. 
C.  For any lot fronting entirely on the turnaround area of a cul-de-sac street (or the arc of a curve where one hundred fifty feet of frontage is impractical or difficult to create), the minimum continuous frontage on a public street shall be seventy-five feet if such reduced frontage is desirable to produce a satisfactory street pattern for subdivision purposes. The seventy-five feet shall not include any portion of the frontage encumbered by an easement for public or private driveway or roadway purposes for the benefit of a different property. 
D.  Lots meeting the minimum lot size requirements of Sections 16.08.010 and 16.12.050, but not meeting the minimum lot frontage requirements of Section 16.08.020A, may be approved by the city council if the council determines that the goals of the Housing Element of the General Plan, and specifically Housing Program 2-A1 of the Housing Element of 2002 or successor provision, would be thereby advanced. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.08.030 - Lot shape and width. 
A.  Every lot shall provide a satisfactory useable area upon which to erect a single-family dwelling in compliance with the requirements of this Code. 
B.  Except as recommended for approval by the city engineer and approved by the city council, the minimum width between any non-intersecting property lines of a lot shall be one hundred feet. That is, each point along a property line of a lot shall be at least one hundred feet away from each point along any other property line of the same lot; however, two property lines that meet are not required to be at least one hundred feet apart. 
C.  Flag lots (also known as key lots) shall not be permitted. A flag lot is a lot whose buildable area is located to the rear of the lot and whose access to the abutting street is by means of a narrow corridor of land having a street frontage of less than one hundred fifty feet. 
D.  The side lines of lots shall run approximately at right angles to the street upon which the lot abuts. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.08.040 - Legal nonconforming lots. 
    A lot lawfully created in accordance with local and state law then in effect but not meeting the current requirements of this chapter shall not be required to meet them; provided, however, that if any such lot is proposed to be subdivided, the subdivision shall be required to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
Chapter 16.12 - HILLSIDE LOT SIZE 

16.12.010 - Intent. 
    The intent of this chapter is to regulate land in hillside areas with an average slope of ten percent or greater in order to accomplish one or more of the following: 
A.  To substantially maintain essential natural features, vegetation, open space, and scenic qualities. 
B.  To minimize water run-off and soil erosion problems incurred in adjustment of the terrain in order to meet on-site and off-site development needs. 
C.  To achieve land use densities that are in keeping with the general plan. 
D.  To insure that the town does not incur an extraordinary or substantial increase in the cost of providing or maintaining public services. 
E.  To encourage the use of development techniques and alternatives that will be compatible with the terrain. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.12.020 - Definitions. 
A.  "Hillside land" means land having an average percent of slope equal to or exceeding ten percent, calculated pursuant to Section 16.12.040. 
B.  "Contour interval" means the difference in elevation between adjacent contour lines on a topographical map. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.12.030 - Conflict. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this code regarding minimum lot size, each lot on hillside land shall be no smaller than the minimum lot size determined pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.12.040 - Average percent of slope. 
A.  For purposes of this title, the average percent of slope of a parcel being subdivided, or of a single lot, shall be determined by the formula: 
S = 100 IL/A 
where 
S = Average percent of slope, 
I = Contour interval in feet 
L = Summation of existing contour length in feet 
A = Area of lot (in square feet) 
  
B.  The application of this formula is as follows: 

EXAMPLE TOPOGRAPHIC MAP 
Percent Slope - Sample Calculations 
Contour Interval (I) = 5' (from the topographic map above) 
Summation Length of Contours (L) (calculated in feet and measured from the topographic map above) = 7,624 feet 
Contour Elevation Contour Length 100 424 105 1,245 110 1,232 115 1,287 120 1,424 125 1,314 130 698 Summation length of Contours 7,624  
Area (A) = 5 acres @ 43,560 sq. ft. = 217,800 sq. ft. 
Slope = 100 IL/A = 100 (5) 7,624/217,800 = 17.5% 
C.  A topographic map showing contours shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor or civil engineer licensed to practice surveying in State of California. The map shall indicate two foot vertical intervals at a minimum and shall be of a size adequate to allow the calculations required by this chapter to be done. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.12.050 - Calculation of number and size of lots permitted. 
A.  For proposed subdivisions of hillside land, the calculation of the number and size of lots shall be done in two steps: First, using the slope formula set forth in Section 16.12.040, calculate the average slope percent for the whole parcel proposed to be subdivided. Second, compare this calculated average slope percent to Column 1 of the Slope-Density Table below and determine the maximum number of lots per acre (Column 2 of the Slope-Density Table) and the minimum lot size for the subdivision (Column 3 of the Slope-Density Table). If the average slope percent falls between the numbers shown in Column 1, the numbers for all three columns shall be interpolated. For example, if the average slope percent in Column 1 is 17.5%, the density in Column 2 is 1.70 and the minimum lot size in Column 3 is .59. 
Slope-Density Table 
Column 1 Average Slope Percent (calculated per 16.12.040) Column 2 Density (Lots Per Acre) Column 3 Minimum Lot Size Less than 10 2.00 .50 10 1.85 .54 15 1.75 .57 20 1.65 .61 25 1.50 .67 30 1.25 .80 35 1.00 1.00 40 0.75 1.33 More than 40 0.50 2.00  
B.  The maximum number of lots allowed for any proposed subdivision shall be calculated by multiplying the subdivision's total acreage by the density allowed by Column 2. If the resulting number of lots permitted is not a whole number, the number of lots permitted shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number if each resulting lot can individually satisfy the minimum lot size set forth in Column 3; otherwise, the number of lots permitted shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number. In other words, in all cases, the lot size for each lot in the proposed subdivision shall be no smaller than the minimum lot size allowed by Column 3. 
C.  The calculations required by this section are illustrated as follows: 
Sample Lot Calculation 
    Assume a 5 acre parcel with 17.5% average slope. 
    This means that: 
    Column 1 = 17.5 
    Column 2 = 1.70 (interpolated) 
    Column 3 = 0.59 (interpolated) 
    This means that: 
    1.70 = density per acre of the proposed 5 acre subdivision 
    1.70 density × 5 acres = 8.5 lots maximum 
    8.5 lots rounds up to 9 lots 
    However, each individual lot must meet the requirements of Column 3, i.e., must be at least .59 acres in size. Nine lots at the minimum lot size (9 lots @ .59 acres = 5.31 acres total) exceed the size of the 5 acre site, so only 8 lots maximum (8 lots @ .59 acres = 4.72 acres total) may be allowed in the proposed subdivision. 
D.  Frontage and other requirements of this and other titles may also affect the maximum number of lots possible in a proposed subdivision and may increase the minimum lot size otherwise applicable to lots on hillside land. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to make such other requirements inapplicable. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
Chapter 16.16 - SUBDIVISION APPROVAL PROCESS 

16.16.010 - Outline of subdivision approval process. 
A.  The subdivision approval process is outlined below in general terms. Of necessity, there are many details and requirements not listed here, the omission of which shall not be interpreted as making them inapplicable. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require or commit the city council or the town to approve any application, map, environmental assessment, or other document or to limit the city council or the town in any way except as otherwise required by law or to supersede or vary the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Subdivision Map Act, or any other applicable law. 
B.  The subdivision approval process in summary consists of the following steps: 
    Step 1: Conceptual review is conducted as set forth in Sections 16.16.020 through 16.16.060, if applicable. 
    Step 2: The applicant submits a tentative map application to the city engineer. The applicant also submits to the director of building and planning a final environmental information form and any studies or additional environmental information required. 
    Step 3: The city engineer prepares a staff report. 
    Step 4: The initial study and environmental assessment are conducted and the most appropriate CEQA document relating to the proposed application will be prepared as directed by the director of building and planning. 
    Step 5: The Architecture and Design Review Board holds a public hearing to review the design of the subdivision and any design-related issues. 
    Step 6: The city council holds a public hearing and considers the environmental assessment document prepared for compliance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and will either adopt, approve, or reject the document. If the CEQA document is approved or adopted, the city council will then hold a public hearing and consider the tentative map application. This hearing may be noticed and held at the same time as the certification and adoption of the CEQA document, but the actions of the council are separate. The tentative map application will not be considered without approval or certification of the environmental compliance document. 
    Step 7: The city council reviews the final map and the required subdivision improvements. 
    Step 8: The city council approved, denies or conditionally approves the application based on the findings outlined in the State Subdivision Map Act. 
    Step 9: The applicant submits the final map application to the city engineer with all other required documents, bonds, and security instruments. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.16.020 - Conceptual review. 
    In addition to the subdivision approval process required under the Subdivision Map Act and outlined in Section 16.16.060, subdivisions shall be subject to a conceptual review prior to submission of a tentative map. The conceptual review requires review of a conceptual plan together with the preliminary environmental analysis and is intended to facilitate optimum subdivision design, reduce unproductive effort by all concerned, and bring about a better result for applicants, the town residents, and the city council. The early conceptual review also aids in the identification of potential environmental issues, preparation of an environmental assessment, and preparation of an acceptable proposed tentative map. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.16.030 - Conceptual plan-Definition. 
    A conceptual plan consists of the applicant's proposal for potentially subdividing the property in question, indicating possible numbers and boundaries of lots, possible improvements on the lots (including, but not limited to, retaining walls, grading quantities, location of proposed building pads and any other slope-related features), possible ways in which public services may be provided, possible access locations, and possible ways of dealing with the major physical characteristics of the property in question, all indicated in relatively preliminary conceptual terms. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.16.040 - Preliminary environmental analysis-Definition. 
    The preliminary environmental analysis is the town's preliminary review of the conceptual plan and the environmental information form submitted by the applicant and other environmental issues identified during the conceptual review process. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.16.050 - When required. 
    A conceptual plan and conceptual review shall be required for all subdivisions. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.16.060 - Public hearing and city council response. 
A.  The following documents and fee shall be filed with the planning department to begin the preliminary review process: 
1.  Completed and signed conceptual plan application on the proper form. 
2.  Conceptual plan application fee in the amount set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
3.  A current title guaranty report or letter by a title company verifying applicant's ownership as required by Section 16.20.020 E. If the applicant is not the current owner of the property, a consent letter from the property owner approving the application is required. 
4.  Completed environmental information form. 
5.  Completed conceptual plan, with the prescribed attachments, consistent with the application requirements. 
6.  Any additional information specific to the site that is required by the city engineer or the director of building and planning. 
7.  Proof of legality of the existing lot/s. 
8.  The conceptual review fee in effect at the time the application is submitted. 
B.  The city council shall hold a public hearing, noticed per Chapter 1.20 Type A notice, and review the preliminary environmental analysis prepared by the planning staff, the report of the city engineer, and the conceptual plan prepared and presented by the applicant. 
C.  After receiving the staff reports and public testimony at the hearing, the city council shall provide preliminary comments to the applicant regarding issues relating to the subdivision's design, including, but not limited to, the number, location, and configuration of the lots, the location of buildable sites on the lots, the access to the lots, the handling of any significant topographical or geologic features, the treatment of trees and other vegetation in the subdivision, concerns identified by the public, and any other relevant comments. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
Chapter 16.18 - PARK IN-LIEU FEES 

16.18.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to mitigate the impacts of property development and implement Action 1.2 of the town's open space and conservation element of the general plan by requiring developers of new subdivisions to pay park in-lieu fees that will be used to develop new or rehabilitate existing neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities that serve the proposed subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.18.020 - Payment of fee. 
A.  No final subdivision map shall be approved nor shall it be recorded unless, in connection therewith, a fee, in lieu of land within the subdivision to be dedicated to the town for park or recreational purposes, has been paid, which fee shall be determined in accordance with the standards and in the manner set forth in this chapter. 
B.  In the event that final map approval does not occur within six months after receipt of payment, the amount of the fee shall be recalculated. The recalculated fee shall be determined using the fee schedule in effect at the time of final map approval. The additional fee, if any, shall be paid in accordance with subsection A. of this section before the final map is submitted for approval. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.18.030 - Calculation of in-lieu fee to be paid. 
A.  The calculation of the in-lieu fee can be illustrated by the following example: 
1.  A ten-acre subdivision will be subdivided into eight lots. 
2.  Each lot will be inhabited by 2.9 people, which is the average number of people per household in town according to the latest census. 
3.  Therefore, the eight-lot subdivision will add a total of 23.2 people (8 × 2.9 = 23.2) to the town's population. 
4.  Each of the 23.2 additional people needs .003 acre of additional park/recreation land, this .003 figure being established by state law and the town's general plan. 
5.  Therefore, the 23.2 additional people will need a total of 0.0696 acre (23.2 × .003 = 0.0696) of additional park/recreation land. 
6.  If the average cost of an acre of unimproved land in the town is one million one hundred thousand dollars (this number is used for illustration only - see Section 16.18.040 for how the average cost will be calculated for any given year), then the cost of providing 0.0696 acre for the 23.2 additional people is seventy-six thousand five hundred sixty dollars ($1,100,000 x 0.0696 = $76,560), which is the amount of the in-lieu fee. 
B.  The formula for calculating the in-lieu fee for a subdivision is illustrated as follows: 
    A × .003 × B × C = amount of in-lieu fee, 
    when A = the number of lots within the subdivision, 
    and B = the cost of one acre of unimproved land, as determined under Section 16.18.040, 
    and C = average number of persons per house hold according to the latest Census. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.18.040 - Cost of one acre of unimproved land. 
A.  The cost of one acre of unimproved land shall be calculated annually each spring by adding (i) the total sales price per acre of every unimproved parcel of land in the town sold in the previous two calendar years, adjusted to include the estimated cost of any subdivision improvements required but not yet installed, plus (ii) the total sales price per acre of every teardown in the town sold in the previous two calendar years (a teardown being defined in subsection A.1.c. of Section 2.12.070 of the Hillsborough Municipal Code), and then calculating the average sales price per acre of all such sales. The average so calculated shall be the cost of one acre of unimproved land for purposes of this chapter. 
B.  The schedule of fees adopted by the town for each fiscal year shall include the cost of one acre of unimproved land, calculated according to subsection A. of this section, for the two-calendar-year period immediately preceding the fiscal year. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.18.050 - Use of in-lieu fees. 
A.  The fees paid pursuant to this chapter in connection with a particular subdivision may be used only for the purpose of providing new or rehabilitating existing park or recreational sites and facilities located anywhere in the town that will serve such subdivision and the future residents therein. Such sites and facilities shall comply with the principles and standards set forth in the general plan approved and adopted by the city council. 
B.  Any fees collected under this chapter, if not sooner expended as set forth herein, shall be committed to a dedicated capital improvement fund within five years after (i) the payment of the in-lieu fees or (ii) the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
Chapter 16.20 - TENTATIVE MAPS 

16.20.010 - When required. 
    A tentative map (and a final map), as defined in the Subdivision Map Act, shall be required for all subdivisions. The tentative map shall be processed in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act and such additional requirements as are provided in Title 16 of the Municipal Code. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.20.020 - Map specifications and information. 
A.  The tentative map shall be legibly drawn to the satisfaction of the city engineer and shall include all the requirements set forth in the Tentative Map Information Policy prepared by the city engineer, Subdivision Map Act, and this Code. 
B.  The proposed street name for each street to be dedicated to the town shall be indicated on the tentative map. Any street that is a continuation of or is in the line of prolongation of any existing dedicated street shall be given the same name as the existing, dedicated street. If, in the judgment of the city engineer, any proposed street name (i) duplicates, or is confusingly similar to, the name of any existing street in town or in the general community served by the same police, fire, and other emergency services, or (ii) is otherwise inappropriate, the city engineer shall direct the subdivider to choose a different proposed street name and indicate that on the tentative map. The final decision as to street names shall be made by the city council in conjunction with the tentative map approval process. 
C.  The width of existing rights-of-way shall be shown. If it is proposed to enlarge an existing right-of-way, the increased width of such right-of-way shall be shown. 
D.  If it is impossible or impractical to place upon the tentative map any matter required by this chapter, such matter or information shall be furnished in a written statement which shall be submitted with such map. 
E.  The tentative map shall be accompanied by a current title guaranty report or letter by a title company qualified to do business in the state of California, showing all parties whose consent is necessary to pass clear title to the land being subdivided. If the subdivider is not the current owner of the property, a consent letter from the owner shall be provided. All legal forms and notes used in certificates, acknowledgments, and the like shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney and city engineer. 
F.  The tentative map shall, when practical, provide for town emergency access drives (as defined in Section 16.28.040 A.) and/or pedestrian pathways connecting to adjacent public streets as approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.20.030 - Filing. 
A.  The tentative map shall be filed with the city engineer, together with the appropriate filing fee and supporting documentation. The filing fee shall be set by resolution of the city council in an amount determined from time to time by the city council to be a reasonable fee for covering the costs of processing the tentative map. 
B.  Before accepting any tentative map for filing, the city engineer shall examine it as to its compliance with provisions of this chapter and all other applicable laws and policies and shall require such compliance before allowing the map to be filed. 
C.  Within five days of determining that the tentative map application is complete pursuant to Government Code Section 65943, the city engineer shall send a notice of this determination to the boards of the Hillsborough City School District and the San Mateo Union High School District as set forth in Government Code Section 66455.7 or successor provision. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.20.040 - City engineer's report and city council hearing. 
A.  The city engineer shall make his or her written report on the tentative map to the city council within the time period provided in by Government Code Section 66452.1 or successor provision. Such report shall recommend approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of the map and shall state the reasons therefore, together, where applicable, with recommended changes or revisions or conditions. Where the health, safety, or welfare of the town would be adversely affected by adherence to the minimum subdivision requirements, the city engineer may recommend and the city council may direct that the lot size, setback, frontage, and/or other particulars of the subdivision be increased or adjusted as reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate the adverse effect. 
B.  The city engineer shall make available to the subdivider a copy of the city engineer's report or recommendation on the tentative map as provided in Government Code Section 66452.3 or successor provision. 
C.  The city council shall hold a public hearing and consider the application's compliance with CEQA, the adoption or approval of the appropriate CEQA document in a public hearing. Following adoption or approval of the appropriate CEQA document, the city council shall hold a public hearing to review the city engineer's report and determine whether the tentative map complies with the Subdivision Map Act and this Title. This public hearing may be held either at the regular meeting at which the city engineer makes his or her written report on the map and where CEQA document is adopted or approved, or at a subsequent meeting, the date of which shall be set in accordance with Government Code Section 66452.2 or successor provision. The city council may disapprove any one or more of the proposed street names, in which case the subdivider and the city council shall agree on a different street name (which does not duplicate, and is not confusingly similar to, the name of any existing street in town or in the general community served by the same police, fire, and other emergency services) in place of any disapproved one. 
D.  The city engineer shall cause notice of the meeting at which the city council will hold the public hearing and consider the tentative map to be given as set forth in Chapter 1.20 for a Type A notice. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.20.050 - Expiration. 
A.  An approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall expire at the conclusion of the applicable time period under Government Code Section 66452.6 or successor provision. 
B.  Upon application filed by the subdivider prior to the expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map, the time at which the map expires may be extended by the city council for a maximum of twelve additional months, as set forth in Government Code Section 66452.6(a) or successor provision, and may be further extended by the city council, as set forth in Government Code Section 66452.6(e) or successor provision. 
C.  As set forth in Government Code Section 66452.6(d), the expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall terminate all proceedings and no final map shall be filed for all or any portion of the subdivision without first processing a new tentative map. Delivery of an acceptable final map to the city engineer shall be deemed a timely filing for purposes of this paragraph. 
D.  In the event of subsequent amendments to the Subdivision Map Act, the then-current provisions of the Subdivision Map Act with respect to the subject matter of this Section 16.20.050 shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.20.060 - Vesting tentative map. 
A.  As authorized by Chapter 4.5 of the Subdivision Map Act, whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act or this title requires that a tentative map be filed, a vesting tentative map may be filed instead. If a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall be subject to Chapter 4.5 or successor provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented by this Section 16.20.060. If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the vesting tentative map statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
B.  A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner, including payment of fees, as set forth in this title for tentative maps, provided that: 
1.  Any map filed as a vesting tentative map shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map;" 
2.  If any discretionary approval, such as rezoning or annexation, is applicable to the proposed development, such approval shall be obtained prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the vesting tentative map. 
C.  The provisions of Section 16.20.050 regarding expiration of a tentative map shall likewise apply to a vesting tentative map. These provisions regarding map expiration are similar to a tentative map. 
D.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the date that the city engineer determines (pursuant to Sections 16.20.020 and 16.20.030) that the vesting tentative map application is complete pursuant to Government Code Section 65943 or successor provision; provided, however, that this general rule is subject to the following exceptions or modifications: 
1.  If, prior to determining that the map is complete, the town has initiated proceedings in accordance with Government Code Section 66464.2 or successor provision to amend applicable general or specific plans or zoning or subdivision ordinances, the town may apply any ordinances, policies, or standards enacted or instituted as a result of those proceedings which are in effect on the date that the local agency approves or disapproves the map. 
2.  The town may condition or deny a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement if the condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law, or if the failure to so condition or deny would place the residents of the subdivision or the mediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety. 
3.  A property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in the general rule above, and the town may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011)

Easement lines on the map shall be shown to the centerline or side lines of each easement. Each easement shall be clearly labeled and identified and, if already of record, its record reference shall be shown on the map. If not of record, a statement to that effect shall be placed on the title sheet of the final map. 
C.  All right-of-way and easement dedications and abandonments properly set out in the owner's certificate and dedicated or indicated, as the case may be, on the map; provided, however, that the town shall not be obligated to accept any offer of dedication. 
D.  All land intended for any public use. Such land shall be dedicated for public use; provided, however, that the town shall not be obligated to accept any such offer of dedication. 
E.  Boundary lines shown for each city boundary line crossing or adjoining the subdivision, each such line being clearly designated and tied in by survey to the subdivision or subdivisions shown on the map. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.24.060 - Watercourses. 
    The subdivider shall record covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) in a form approved by the town and acceptable to the city attorney, providing that as to any lot in the subdivision on which a natural watercourse is located, all responsibility for maintenance and repair of the watercourse shall belong to the owner of the particular lot and that the watercourse shall not be part of the public drainage system and that the town shall have no responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.24.070 - Approval, disapproval, and recording. 
A.  The city council shall, at the meeting at which the council receives the map or, at the council's next regular meeting after the meeting at which the council receives the map, approve the map if it conforms to all the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act, this title, and all other law, applicable at the time of approval or conditional approval of the tentative map. If the map does not conform, the legislative body shall disapprove the map. 
B.  At the same time as it approves the final map, the city council shall accept or reject each offer of dedication, if any, and each offer of abandonment, if any. The city council shall make the necessary finding of consistency with the town's general plan, as required by Government Code Section 65402 or successor provision, prior to accepting any offer of dedication or abandonment. Abandonments shall comply with the Subdivision Map Act or the Street Vacation Act of 1941 (streets and highways Code Sections 8300 et seq.) or successor provision, as applicable. 
C.  If the city council does not approve or disapprove the map within the prescribed time limits, or any authorized extension thereof, as set forth in Section 16.20.050(B), and the map conforms to all requirements and rulings, it shall be deemed approved, and the city clerk shall certify or state its approval thereon, as set forth in Government Code Section 66458(b) or successor provision. 
D.  Upon approval of a final map, the city clerk shall transmit the map to the owner or subdivider for filing with the county recorder. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.24.080 - Agreement with the town. 
    If, at the time of approval of the final map by the city council, any required public improvements have not been completed and accepted in accordance with standards established by the town, the city council shall require, as a condition precedent to the approval of the final map, that the owners of the subdivision enter into one of the agreements set forth in Section 16.28.080. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
Chapter 16.28 - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS 

16.28.010 - Improvements generally. 
A.  Streets and easements. The subdivider shall improve all streets and easements in the subdivision. Such improvements shall include grading and surfacing of streets, domestic water supply as may be necessary to protect public health and provide fire protection, extension of sanitary sewer service to each lot, storm water drainage, street lighting systems, if required, street name and regulatory signs, underground electric and telephone systems and other public utilities, gutters, paving, curbs, concrete structures, culverts, bridges, drains, water storage tanks, and reservoirs, pumping stations, and removal of vegetation from street rights-of-way as may be necessary, and any other improvements necessary to the use of such public improvements or necessary for the public safety. All subdivision improvements, including the methods, materials, and design of the improvements, shall comply with the provisions of the chapter and conform with the standards and specifications of the town for the construction of public improvements as compiled by the city engineer. Such standards may be changed from time to time at the discretion of the city engineer consistent with sound engineering practice and with the other requirements of this Code, town policy, and other applicable law. 
B.  Plans and specifications. 
1.  Before public improvement work is commenced, detailed plans and specifications shall be provided to the city engineer. 
2.  When the city council has approved the tentative map and the city engineer has approved the plans and specifications, the subdivider may proceed with the work. 
3.  Inspection and approval of all work shall be done under the supervision of the city engineer. 
4.  No improvement shall be accepted by the city council for dedication to the town until such time as the completed work has been approved by the city engineer. 
C.  Costs. The subdivider shall pay to the town the actual costs of the city engineer's services under this chapter, as determined by the city engineer, before the final map is approved by the city council. The city engineer may require that the subdivider pay a deposit in the amount of estimated costs pending completion of the city engineer's services and calculation of the actual costs. If the deposit proves to be in excess of the actual costs, the town shall return the excess to the subdivider upon making such calculation. If the deposit proves to be less than the actual costs, the subdivider shall pay the balance of the actual costs before the final map is approved by the city council. 
D.  Conditions precedent. The provisions set forth in subsections B. and C. of this section shall constitute conditions precedent to the issuance of a building permit (as set forth in Chapter 15.60) and the commencement of the design review process (as set forth in Chapter 2.12). 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.28.020 - Improvements specifically. 
A.  Drainage. 
1.  Sufficient storm drainage work shall be installed to prevent flooding or inundation of streets and adjoining property by storm waters and shall provide sufficient means to dispose of normal water flow and protect pavements against deterioration. Drainage work shall be designed for a twenty-five year storm with no damage from a one hundred year storm to the structure and dwelling unit. Drainage works shall include adequate gutters, catch basins, culvert crossings, storm sewers, underdrains, head walls, bulkheads, trash racks, and other structures, where necessary, and shall incorporate best management practices as required by the water quality control board. Runoff factor, subject to variation because of the nature and use of the terrain, shall be clearly stated and shall meet with the approval of the city engineer. 
2.  Where substantial changes to existing drainage patterns are proposed, the subdivider shall not direct storm drainage onto adjacent properties by surface flows or point discharges or other outlets unless connected directly to an approved public drainage facility. With the approval of the city engineer, drainage to an approved public facility may be accomplished with an easement to connect to adequate existing private drainage facilities or to install new facilities under adjoining property, including access for maintenance. 
B.  Water supply. Mains, valves, regulators, meter connections, lot services, pumping plants, storage tanks, reservoirs, and other water supply facilities shall be installed as required to provide an adequate water supply to each lot and provide fire protection satisfactory to the fire chief. 
C.  Street lighting. All new subdivisions shall provide a system of electroliers or street lighting equipment but only if and to the extent required by the city council upon the advice of the city engineer. 
D.  Undergrounding. Complete underground electric and telephone facilities shall be installed for all lots in the subdivision. "Underground facilities" means all public or private equipment used to provide service to the consumer and includes all cable, wires, conduits, manholes, transformers, junction and terminal boxes, and all similar devices. All underground utilities (including, but not limited to, sewer, water, storm drainage, cable TV, telephone, electricity, gas, lighting, and any other power or communications installations) shall be extended from the street over the property line into the lot before the construction of final pavements, curbs, gutters, or walks. The subdivider is required to underground all overhead utilities along the street frontage adjacent to the property. When the existing overhead utilities along the frontage are on the opposite side of the street fronting the property, the subdivider shall underground all the services to the subdivision to the point of connection to the overhead system. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.28.030 - Utility easements and streets. 
A.  Easements for utilities. Easements of not less than five feet in width shall be provided on each side of all rear and side lot lines and/or where necessary for public utilities. Easements of greater width may be required where necessary in the opinion of the city engineer. 
B.  Street widths. The minimum width for city streets shall be forty feet, except that in cases where, in the opinion of the city council, the topography or special conditions make a street of such width impossible, impractical, or unadvisable, such lesser or greater width as is deemed adequate or advisable by the city council may be provided, except that residential streets over two thousand feet in length shall be fifty feet in right-of-way width and the end of cul-de-sac streets shall provide a turning area at least eighty feet in diameter. 
C.  Intersection angle. Any street intersecting any other street shall do so at an angle that is as nearly ninety degrees as is practical. 
D.  Street connections. Each street shall connect at both ends to the existing street pattern; provided, however, that where evidence satisfactory to the city council is given that a through street is impossible or impractical, a cul-de-sac may be provided. Any cul-de-sac shall meet the requirements set forth in Section 16.28.040. All streets shall be in alignment with existing adjacent streets by continuation of the centerlines thereof, or by adjustment with curves. Provision shall be made by reservation or extension of streets to boundary lines for future extension of streets through adjoining undeveloped property. Exceptions to the foregoing requirements may be approved by the city council when a normal layout of streets is not possible without resulting detriment to the subdivision or adjoining property. 
E.  Street grade. No street shall have a slope in excess of sixteen percent. Street slopes shall include a minimum hundred foot vertical curve transition to changes in slope. The roadway centerline through an intersection shall not exceed a five percent slope. 
F.  Centerline radii. Roadway centerline radii shall be not less than five hundred feet on collector and arterial streets, as identified in the general plan, and not less than two hundred fifty feet on all other streets. 
G.  Blocks. Blocks shall not exceed two thousand feet in length. At street intersections of approximately ninety degrees, the block corners shall be rounded at the property line on a curve radius of not less than twenty-five feet; provided, however, that the curve radius shall conform to the radius of existing corners at the same intersections where such radius is greater than twenty-five feet. Where streets intersect at angles other than ninety degrees, a radius of such size shall be used as to provide results equivalent to the foregoing, in respect to traffic movement, visibility, and design. 
H.  Streets at subdivision border. No subdivision shall be approved that includes a less than a standard width street right-of-way within the subdivision at its border unless the subdivider acquires legal authority to improve sufficient land outside of and bordering the subdivision to create a street right-of-way along the border of the subdivision meeting the requirements of subsection B. of this section and unless such right-of-way may legally be dedicated by the subdivider to the town. 
I.  Street signs. For all streets to be dedicated to the town and private streets, the subdivider shall install traffic signage as set forth in the public improvement agreement or as otherwise directed by the city engineer. Traffic signage includes, but is not necessarily limited to, all pavement markings and striping, street name signs, regulatory, warning, and advisory signs. All signs shall be of a type, size, material, color and manner of installation as to conform with the standards of the town of the standard specifications of the department of transportation. 
J.  Trees in the right-of-way. Any tree planting or landscaping program in the right-of-way required by the city council as a condition of approval of the tentative map or required by the city engineer as part of the subdivision improvement agreement shall be installed in conformance with such map conditions or improvement agreement. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.28.040 - Culs-de-sac. 
A.  Definition. For purposes of this chapter, a cul-de-sac is any street closed at one end (i.e., a street whose entrance and exit are one and the same) and that is not continued onto a connecting public street via another connecting public street or via an approved town emergency access drive (which is a dedicated fenced and/or gated access easement with an all-purpose roadway width as approved by the Central County Fire). Examples of the application of this definition are shown in diagrams 1 through 5 of this section. 
B.  Long cul-de-sacs. No tentative or final map shall be approved providing for a cul-de-sac longer than five hundred feet; provided, however, that the city council may approve a greater length, not exceeding one thousand feet ("long cul-de-sac"), if the city council finds that significant benefits of such greater length have been demonstrated. Vacant lots fronting on cul-de-sacs in existence prior to November 11, 1992, shall not be denied development merely because such lots are more than five hundred feet from the street intersecting the cul-de-sac. 
C.  Measurement. The length of a cul-de-sac shall be the distance (as measured along the center line of the street or streets), from the farthest point of the turnaround bulb to the point where the cul-de-sac intersects the extended street gutter line or the centerline intersection of the approved emergency access drive. Examples of measurement are shown in diagrams 1 through 4 of this section. 
D.  Council determinations. In approving a long cul-de-sac, the city council shall consider the topographical features of the land along the cul-de-sac, including, but not limited to, the slope of the paved cul-de-sac and the possible slopes of the driveways, the number of fire hydrants and the nature and number of other public fire protection devices (such as water storage tanks or cisterns) located on the connecting street and proposed to be located on the cul-de-sac, and any other relevant factors bearing on public safety. The city council shall determine how many dwellings shall be permitted along the long cul-de-sac, whether the minimum lot size and/or minimum setbacks otherwise applicable shall be increased and by how much, and whether the maximum square footage otherwise allowable under Title 17 shall be decreased and by how much. 
E.  Stricter standards. For any cul-de-sac, regardless of length, the city engineer may recommend and the city council may require stricter standards, including, but not limited to, a greater street width, a larger cul-de-sac bulb, and/or a shorter street length, than otherwise required. 
F.  Diagrams. The following diagrams illustrate the provisions of subsections A and C of this section: 

DIAGRAM 1-"TYPICAL CUL-DE-SAC" 

DIAGRAM 2-"PARTIAL CUL-DE-SAC"

16.28.050 - Compatibility with lot requirements. 
    All public improvements shall be designed and constructed taking into account the lot requirements set forth in Chapters 16.08 and 16.12. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.28.060 - Special circumstances. 
    In special circumstances where necessary to accomplish a satisfactory street pattern or to accommodate local terrain, the city engineer may recommend and the city council may allow a variation of the centerline radii, street grade, block length, or angle of lot side lines from the requirements set forth in this section. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.28.070 - Entrance monuments. 
    No entrance monuments, entrance arches, locked security gates, or any other monuments of any kind or size intended to mark the entrance to subdivisions shall be allowed or installed. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.28.080 - Agreement with the town and security. 
    If, at the time of approval of the final map by the city council, any required public improvements have not been completed and accepted in accordance with standards established by the town, the city council shall require, as a condition precedent to the approval of the final map, that the owners of the subdivision enter into one of the following agreements with the town as selected by the town: 
1.  An agreement to complete such improvements by a specified deadline at the subdivider's expense and guaranteed by the security specified in the Subdivision Map Act. The subdivider shall provide a performance bond and labor and materials bond in an amount each equaling one hundred percent of the city engineer's estimate for all public improvements plus the town's attorney fees incurred in connection with an action to obtain compliance with the agreement for subdivision improvements and to enforce the town's rights under the performance bond. The performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney. 
2.  An agreement to initiate and consummate proceedings under an appropriate special assessment act for the financing and completion of all such improvements; provided, however, that if the public improvements are constructed pursuant to a special assessment act, the town shall bear no expense related thereto and provided, further, that if the public improvements are not completed under such special assessment act, they shall be completed pursuant to an agreement as described in paragraph 1. above. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
Chapter 16.32 - APPEALS 

16.32.010 - Filing-When. 
A.  Appeal by subdivider.

Chapter 16.36 - LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS 

16.36.010 - Purpose. 
    California Government Code Section 66412 of the Subdivision Map Act provides that lot line adjustments are excluded from the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act when they have been approved by the local agency. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for granting such approval. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.36.020 - Definition. 
    A lot line adjustment is a change in location of one or more lot lines between four or fewer existing adjoining parcels, where the land taken from one parcel is added to an adjoining parcel and where a greater number of parcels than originally existed is not thereby created. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.36.030 - Application. 
A.  Application for a lot line adjustment shall be made by delivering to the city engineer two copies of a lot line adjustment map (plat of lot line adjustment) on which the proposed lot line adjustment is shown, together with the additional information required by Section 16.36.040 B. The lot line adjustment map shall meet the requirements of Section 16.36.040 A. 
B.  At the time of submitting the lot line adjustment map, the applicant shall also pay the lot line adjustment application fee in the amount established from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
C.  The lot line adjustment application may be processed instead as a merger and resubdivision pursuant to California Government Code Section 66499.20-1/2, if the city engineer and the applicant so agree or if the then-applicable law so requires. 
(Ord. No. 696, 7-11-2011) 
16.36.040 - Form and content.

2.  The issuance of a license or permit by a governmental agency other than the town indicating that a business is located in the town; 
3.  Storage of commercial quantities of merchandise or material on the premises or storage on the premises of items that are commercial in nature and not related to the use of the dwelling as a single-family residence. 
E.  The violation of any provision of this section shall be an infraction, punishable as set forth in Chapter 1.08 of this code, which sets forth the schedule of fines for infractions. 
F.  In addition to any other consequence(s), including, but not necessarily limited to, that set forth in subsection E of this section, the violation of any provision of this section shall be grounds for immediate revocation of the home business permit. 
(Ord. 639 § 13, 2003: Ord 613 §§ 3, 4, 2000; Ord 591 § 2, 1999) 
(Ord. No. 746, § 6, 11-13-2017) 
17.16.020 - Use for the purpose of single-family dwelling-Defined. 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this section to insure the preservation of the basic character of the residence district for residential purposes. Residential purposes include the use of the home for food and shelter and as a social institution for the private, religious, educational, cultural, and recreational advantages of the family. Commercial activity, even merely incidental to the use of residential property, or any semblance of such commercial activity, adversely affects the residential character of the residence district and is therefore inconsistent with the preservation of such character. 
B.  Rule. Use of real property and improvements thereon for single-family dwellings, as set forth in subsection A of Section 17.16.010, shall be limited to use for residential purposes exclusively and not for commercial purposes, incidental or otherwise, of any kind, including any semblance of commercial activity; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the otherwise lawful use of the telephone or the U.S. or private mail. This rule shall not affect the qualification of uses under subsections B through J of Section 17.16.010. 
C.  Business Address. Use of the Hillsborough street address of a single-family dwelling in the town in conjunction with the name of any commercial or business entity, organization or operation ("enterprise") is allowed only when a valid home business permit under Section 17.16.015 is in effect for such enterprise and one or more of the following circumstances exist: 
1.  The street address of the enterprise is required on a governmental form. (Examples: fictitious business name statements, state or federal license applications, state or federal registrations, state or federal banking forms) 
2.  The address will appear on items (stationery, business cards, checks, invoices, labels and similar documents) which remain under the physical control of the enterprise and the individual use of which is initiated each time by the enterprise (as distinguished from listings in telephone books, advertising, websites, etc., each single use of which is not initiated by and is not under the physical control of the enterprise). 
    Any other use of the Hillsborough street address of a single-family dwelling in the town in conjunction with the name of any commercial or business entity, organization or operation is prohibited. 
D.  Uses for Commercial Purposes. 
1.  For purposes of the rule set forth in subsection B of this section, "uses for commercial purposes" are all those uses which are deleterious to the purposes underlying the establishment of an exclusively residential zone. 
2.  The following are examples of activities that are "uses for commercial purposes": 
a.  Parties for commercial purposes pursuant to subsection E of this section; 
b.  Use of the street address of a residence in town except as permitted under subsection C of this section; 
c.  Home businesses, as described in Section 17.16.015, for which a valid home business permit is not in effect; 
d.  Activities (which are profit-making or are intended to be profit-making) conducted by a resident in his or her own home that include causing or arranging for (in return for compensation) pickup or delivery of merchandise, products, or services within the town and for which activities a valid home business permit is not in effect; 
e.  Activities (which are profit-making or are intended to be profit-making) conducted by a resident in his or her own home that include the presence in the home of any person (employee or otherwise) whose sole or primary purpose is to participate in or assist with the activities and for which activities a valid home business permit is not in effect; 
f.  Activities (which are profit-making or are intended to be profit-making) conducted by a resident in his or her own home that cause customers, prospective customers, or other business visitors to come to the resident's home and for which activities a valid home business permit is not in effect; 
g.  Activities (which are profit-making or are intended to be profit-making) conducted by a resident in his or her own home that involve the use of the resident's home address in connection with a business or commercial name or use of the resident's home address on any website and for which activities a valid home business permit is not in effect; and 
h.  Activities (which are profit-making or are intended to be profit-making) conducted by a resident in his or her own home which activities are covered by a valid and current resale license issued by the state of California and for which activities a valid home business permit is not in effect. 
3.  The following are examples of activities that do not constitute "uses for commercial purposes": 
a.  Activities for which a current and valid home business permit has been issued under Section 17.16.015; 
b.  Household services provided to residents of the town by live-in household help; 
c.  Activities (which are profit-making or are intended to be profit-making) conducted by a resident in his or her own home using only the telephone and/or U.S. or private mail service and which do not include any of the underlined activities, listed in subsections (D)(2)(d) through (D)(2)(h) of this section. 
E.  Parties for Commercial Purposes. For purposes of this section, parties or gatherings of individuals at a private residence within the town, invitations to which or announcements of which are advertised or publicized by paid advertisements of any kind in the print, broadcast, or other media or by paid promotion through the U.S. or private mail, or parties or such gatherings for which the host or another individual or entity designated by the host will receive some form of compensation from any individual or entity shall be deemed to be a use for commercial purposes. (Uses described in subsection I of Section 17.16.010 are governed by that subsection and not by subsection E of this section.) 
(Ord. 613 §§ 5-7, 2000; Ord. 390 § 2, 1984) 
17.16.030 - Private schools. 
A.  It is the intent of the town to provide adequate and reasonable standards for the establishment and maintenance of private schools in the town, taking into account the effect of the school's presence upon homes and residents in the neighborhood surrounding the school. The town seeks to achieve a reasonable balance between the needs and interests of the school and the needs and interests of the school's neighbors. 
B.  1. Any private school wishing to operate in the town shall first obtain and maintain a permit to operate issued by the town in accordance with the provisions of this section. Private schools currently operating in the town and having done so continuously from the date of their establishment to December 9, 2002, (the date of introduction of the ordinance amending this section) and having a history of receiving the annual fire and building inspections described in subsection K. of this section, shall be presumed to have received a permit in accordance with the private school provisions of this code in effect at the time such private school began operating in the town. If, after the effective date of this chapter February 13, 2003, any such school wishes to amend its permit to operate, the city council shall first establish the requirements for such school as set forth in subsection B.6. of this section. 
2.  Any private school seeking to do any of the following shall apply for an amendment to their permit to operate: 
a.  Enlarge the school site (i.e., the legal parcel(s) on which the school facility is located and any other contiguous legal parcel owned by the school), 
b.  Increase the school's enrollment beyond the maximum number allowed under the school's existing permit, 
c.  Purchase, lease, or rent any real property in town for school purposes (which shall not be deemed to include the purchase, lease, or rent of a residential property to be used solely for residential purposes so long as such use does not include or consist of a group housing arrangement for school students), 
d.  Change the grades of instruction offered at the school; provided, however, that if town staff determines that the elimination of a grade will have no adverse effect on the neighborhood surrounding the school, the elimination of a grade may be approved administratively by town staff and the school's permit to operate so annotated, 
e.  Modify any previous condition of approval, 
f.  Incorporate multifamily rental housing on the school site for use and occupancy by faculty or other employees of the school. 
g.  Increase the size of any structure, play area, or athletic area; provided, however, that an increase in size of a play area or athletic area that, 
(i)  is not a field or court constructed for soccer, softball, baseball, lacrosse, rugby, or other team sport, 
(ii)  does not reduce the distance between the existing play area or athletic area and the property line between the school and any neighboring property, and 
(iii)  does not reduce any landscaping or structure providing or intended to provide screening between the school and any neighboring property shall not require an amendment to the school's permit to operate, 
h.  Add any new structure, play area, or athletic area; provided, however, that the replacement of play or sport apparatus in a play area or athletic area with like or substantially similar play or sport apparatus in the same or virtually the same location as was occupied by the replaced apparatus shall not be deemed to add a new play area or athletic area, 
i.  Demolish any existing structure, play area, or athletic area; provided, however, that for purposes of this item i., "structure" shall not include swing sets, slides, climbers, sandboxes, and similar play or sport apparatus, 
j.  Modify (which shall not be deemed to include routine maintenance and normal pruning) landscaping that is located between a structure, play area, or athletic field and the perimeter of the school site in such a way as to diminish or potentially diminish the screening theretofore provided or intended to be provided by such landscaping, 
k.  Modify its parking facilities or arrangements. 
    Amendments regarding subsection B.2.a. through f. shall be referred to the city council and processed as set forth in this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, amendments regarding items g. through k. shall be referred for design review under the provisions of Chapter 2.12 and only thereafter referred to the city council for processing as items a. through e. are processed if either the architecture and design review board so recommends or any appeal is filed pursuant to Section 2.12.080. In considering an application for amendment, the city council or the architecture and design review board may consider the related consequences of granting the amendment and impose appropriate conditions, as necessary, to address those consequences. 
3.  Application for a permit to operate a private school, or for an amendment to an existing permit to operate, shall be made to the city council on the prescribed form, which shall be filed with the planning office together with an application fee in the amount set from time to time by resolution of the city council. Following submission of an application for a permit to operate a private school and before the public hearing on such application, the applicant shall arrange for an initial inspection of the type described in subsection K. of this section. The results of such inspection shall be part of the application. 
4.  All applications for a permit to operate, or an amendment to an existing permit to operate, shall be heard at a public hearing before the city council, scheduled and noticed as specified in Chapter 1.20 for a Type A notice. Such notice shall include the following wording: "If you challenge in court the issuance or nonissuance of a permit to operate a private school or the approval or disapproval of an amendment to an existing permit to operate a private school, you may be limited to raising only those issues you or someone else raised at the public hearing described in this notice, or that you or someone else raised in written correspondence delivered to the Hillsborough city council at, or prior to, the public hearing." For purposes of Chapter 1.20, the person requesting the hearing shall be deemed to be the private school. The public hearing shall include review of the application, including, but not limited to, the location, design, and configuration of the school, any proposed amendments or improvements thereto, the impact on the surrounding neighborhood, and all other matters relevant to the requirements set forth in this section. 
5.  If the city council finds that the proposal set forth in the application 
a.  Meets all the requirements of this section to the satisfaction of the city council, 
b.  Achieves a reasonable balance between the needs and interests of the school and the preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare, including, in particular, that of the surrounding neighborhood, 
c.  Is consistent with the general plan, 
d.  Meets all applicable requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), 
e.  Complies with all other applicable standards and requirements of law, the city council shall grant the permit to operate or the amendment to the permit to operate, as the case may be, with such conditions and such reasonable guarantees and evidence of compliance with conditions as the council deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this title. In accepting the permit to operate or amendment to the permit to operate, the private school consents to the entrance onto the school site and into all school buildings at reasonable hours by representatives of the town's police, fire, building, public works, and other departments in order to enforce public safety laws and ordinances and the conditions of approval of the permit or amended permit to operate. Each permit to operate or amendment to permit to operate shall specify the maximum enrollment permitted (in exact numbers rather than merely by reference to the formula in the table set forth in subsection D.2. of this section) and shall caution that the maximum enrollment shall not automatically increase if the private school acquires additional acreage, but may be increased only pursuant to subsection B.2.b. of this section. The maximum enrollment permitted shall be no greater than the maximum number set forth in such formula and may be less than that maximum number. If the city council does not grant the permit to operate or the amendment to the permit to operate, as the case may be, the city council shall deny the application. 
6.  In the case of an application for multifamily rental housing on the school site for use and occupancy by faculty or other employees of the school, the proposal must meet the following additional requirements: 
a.  Utilize complementary architectural vocabulary, massing and scale as single-family residences and as referenced in the town's Design Guidelines, 
b.  Provide a buffer area between school uses and buildings (including multifamily residential) and neighboring single-family residential uses and buildings such as additional setbacks, landscaping and fencing, with sensitivity towards impacts from noise, lighting, vehicles, and higher intensity uses. 
7.  a. In conjunction with granting a permit to operate a private school or an amendment to a permit to operate a private school, the city council shall specify, based on the particular characteristics of the site (or lot) on which the private school is located or proposed to be located, the: 
i.  Minimum lot frontage required on a public street, 
ii.  Maximum permitted floor area ratio, 
iii.  Maximum permitted lot coverage, 
iv.  Maximum permitted size of the buildings (exterior building dimensions, including, without limitation, height), 
v.  Maximum permitted density in the case of multifamily rental housing on the school site for use and occupancy by faculty or other employees of the school, 
vi.  Increased required setback area, if any, beyond the minimums set forth in Chapter 17.24, 
vii.  Hours of operation, 
viii.  Circulation plan, 
ix.  Parking requirements, 
x.  Accessory uses, if any that shall be applicable to the private school so that the private school buildings will not appear to dominate the surrounding neighborhood and will not represent too intense a development of the site, and so that the private school shall not produce undue traffic or parking problems for the surrounding neighborhood or allow the daily congregations of people at the private school to be particularly visible or audible from the surrounding single-family dwellings. The purpose of these requirements is to allow the private school to function while also preserving the residential character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
b.  Because it is impossible, given the varied terrain and sizes of lots in town, to formulate extremely specific, universally applicable standards for items i. through vii. above, an opportunity for representatives of an existing private school or a proposed private school to meet with the city council early in the planning process may be useful. Accordingly, an applicant for an amendment to an existing permit to operate an existing private school or an applicant for a new permit to operate a new private school may request a preliminary review of the school's plans prior to submitting the application. In that case, the city council shall discuss the plans with the applicant at a public meeting and shall provide input to the applicant on the matters set forth in items i. through vii. The preliminary review shall not require public notice apart from the notice that normally occurs for public meetings of the city council. The preliminary review shall not be a public hearing; however, the city council may take public comment if the council so chooses. The purpose of the preliminary review shall be to provide site-specific guidelines to the applicant regarding items i. through vii. Such guidelines may, however, be subject to modification or reconsideration as the result of the public hearing subsequently held to consider the application. 
8.  Upon the city council's approval of the application (with or without conditions), the director of building and planning shall issue a non-transferable, revocable (as set forth in subsection O.) permit to operate a private school upon the premises described in the application, or an amendment to an existing permit to operate, as the case may be, subject to any conditions imposed by the city council. 
C.  No building permit shall be issued except in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit to operate and any amendment thereto. 
D.  The minimum acreage and maximum enrollment of any private school operating in town are as follows: 
1.  The minimum acreage for a private school shall be seven acres (except as otherwise set forth in the table in this section for certain private schools described in subsection M. of this section). 
2.  The maximum number of all students enrolled, without regard to full or part-time status, at a private school at any one time shall be as follows: 
Acreage* Maximum Number of Students 
Enrolled** Under 7.0 acres *** 7.0-7.99 acres 200 students 8.0-8.99 acres 250 students 9.0-9.99 acres 300 students 10.0-10.99 acres 350 students 11.0-19.99 acres 400 students 20.0 or more acres As determined by the city council as part of a master plan and permit to operate, however not to exceed five hundred seventeen students in any case.  
* Actual acreage shall consist of the net lot area of one legal parcel. If the school site encompasses more than one legal parcel, only the largest legal parcel may be counted for purposes of determining maximum enrollment. 
** A private school is not automatically entitled to the maximum enrollment permitted by the above table; the specific maximum enrollment allowed will be stated in the school's permit to operate or amendment to permit to operate according to the enrollment number determined by the council at the time the permit to operate or amendment to permit to operate is issued. 
*** Private schools described in Section 17.16.030 M. and leasing or occupying fewer than seven acres where the public school is also still operating on site shall be subject to all the same rules as any other private school except that the permit to operate shall describe the maximum number of students, which number shall be based on the impact on the neighborhood with respect to traffic, parking, noise, and safety. 
3.  Regardless of the acreage of the private school, the total number of students enrolled shall not exceed five hundred seventeen. 
E.  Multifamily rental housing for use and occupancy by faculty or other employees of the school is permitted. 
F.  Every private school shall be subject to and follow the requirements of the parking rules set forth in Chapter 17.36 of this Code; provided, however, that in all cases adequate off-street parking facilities shall be maintained to park on the school site all the motor vehicles normally brought to the school by its employees, students, and visitors, so as to keep the vehicles from being parked on the public streets. 
G.  Every private school shall be accessible from a public street having a paved width of at least twenty-four feet. 
H.  Every structure, play area, and athletic area on the private school site shall be set back at least twenty-five feet from any property line adjacent to a public street and at least twenty feet from any other property line. The distances shall be measured as set forth in Section 17.24.030 of this code. 
I.  A planted area of trees and shrubs shall be provided between any play area or athletic field and adjacent nonschool property so that a barrier will exist. 
J.  All structures shall be subject to Chapter 17.28, height limitations, of this code. 
K.  The structures to be used for school purposes shall be inspected annually by the city building official and the fire chief, or their designees, for safety and soundness and shall comply with the directions from such staff resulting from such inspections. 
L.  Prior to October 1st each year, the private school shall certify on a form prescribed by the planning office that the school continues to comply with the provisions of this section and with any conditions imposed by the city council in connection with the approval of the permit to operate. Such annual certification shall include a copy of the current annual review and approval by the Central County Fire and the building department and shall be accompanied by payment of the annual certification fee in the amount set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
M.  A private school using buildings owned by the public school district and located on the grounds of a public school in that school district shall be deemed to be a private school for purposes of the Hillsborough Municipal Code. 
N.  No nonschool events (as defined in subsection N.1. of this section) shall be held on the premises of a private school in town except in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
1.  A nonschool event is a private, social event or party (for example, a wedding, a wedding reception, a bar/bat mitzvah party, or an anniversary party) held on the school site, whether held indoors or outdoors or both, not hosted by the school, attended by persons who are invited not by the school but by private individual(s) who are, or by a separate entity which is, hosting the social event or party. An athletic event sponsored by the Hillsborough recreation department or AYSO or Little League or similar organization open to all of the residents of the town of the appropriate age shall not be deemed a private, social event or party and therefore shall not come within the definition of "nonschool event." 
2.  Nonschool events shall not be held on Sundays or legal holidays (those being the days on which the city clerk's office is closed). 
3.  Nonschool events shall not be subject to Chapter 5.16 of this code; however, events conducted or sponsored by the school are not, by definition, nonschool events and are subject to Chapter 5.16 of this Code, as applicable. 
4.  Nonschool events shall abide by Chapter 8.32, the town's noise ordinance, and Chapter 10.80, traffic control plans, of this code. With respect to Chapter 10.80 of this code, a traffic control plan shall be required for a nonschool event, regardless of expected attendance, unless the Hillsborough police department determines that the expected attendance is too small to warrant a traffic control plan. If a traffic control plan is required, the private school shall provide written notification of the event to the neighbors in the areas expected to be affected by the parking and traffic generated by the event. The extent, timing and method of such notification shall be set forth in the traffic control plan. At least three days before the date of the event, the private school shall provide evidence to the Hillsborough police department that such notification has been completed in accordance with the traffic control plan. 
5.  Nonschool events shall be subject to any additional requirements set forth in the conditions to the school's permit to operate and any amendments thereto. 
O.  1. Whenever the city council or the city manager or his or her designee receives information indicating that a private school is not in full compliance with its permit to operate, including any amendments thereto, the city clerk shall issue a written warning to the school, describing the noncompliance and requiring correction within thirty days after the date of the warning. The warning shall also advise the school that if proof of compliance is not received within the thirty-day deadline, the matter shall be heard by the city council on the council meeting date indicated in the warning. 
2.  In the event that proof of compliance is not received by the deadline, the city clerk shall send notice of the hearing before the city council pursuant to Chapter 1.20 of this code for a Type A notice. Such notice shall include the following wording: "If you challenge in court the city council's decision to impose or not impose a revocation or suspension of a permit to operate a private school, you may be limited to raising only those issues you or someone else raised at the public hearing described in this notice, or that you or someone else raised in written correspondence delivered to the Hillsborough city council at, or prior to, the public hearing." The private school shall also receive such notice, which shall be sent certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid to the school's current address. For purposes of Chapter 1.20 of this code, the person requesting the hearing shall be deemed to be the town. 
3.  The notice shall contain the information required by Chapter 1.20 of this code and shall specifically state the manner in which the private school has failed to comply with the provisions of its permit to operate. 
4.  The city council shall conduct a public hearing on the matter and shall take such action as the council deems advisable, making findings as to any noncompliance. The city council may continue such hearing from time to time and may require any additional information as the council deems necessary. 
5.  At the conclusion of the hearing the city council may revoke the permit, suspend the permit until certain conditions are met, or not revoke or suspend the permit at all. The city clerk shall send written notice of the city council's decision to the private school. 
6.  Any person objecting to the decision of the city council shall have ninety days as set forth in California Government Code Section 65009(c)(1)(E) (or such other time period as may be set by amendment to such law) after such decision to bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction; otherwise all objections to the city council's decision shall be deemed waived. 
7.  If the city council has revoked or suspended the permit, it is unlawful for any person to operate a school on the premises of the private school during the time that the permit is revoked or suspended.

17.16.040 - Family day care homes. 
A.  The provisions of this section are imposed pursuant to the authority of Division 2, Chapter 3.6, of the California Health and Safety Code (or successor provision) which provides (1) that a city may apply to single-family residences used for (large and small) family day care homes any local ordinance dealing with building heights, setback area, lot dimensions, health and safety, building standards, environmental impact standards, nuisance abatement, or any other matter within local jurisdiction, so long as such ordinances apply to all single-family dwellings and do not single out (large or small) family day care facilities, and (2) that local ordinances may prescribe specifically for large family day care homes reasonable standards, restrictions and requirements as to spacing, concentration, traffic control, parking and noise control. 
B.  The rules set forth in this section were originally established by interim resolution of the town pending codification in the Hillsborough Municipal Code. This codification supersedes that interim resolution. 
C.  As set forth in Section 1596.78 of the California Health and Safety Code in effect as of February 13, 2003, a "family day care home" is a "home that regularly provides care, protection, and supervision for fourteen or fewer children, in the provider's own home, for periods of less than twenty-four hours per day, while the parents or guardians are away, and is either a large family day care home or a small family day care home." A "large family day care home" is a "home that provides family day care for seven to fourteen children, inclusive, including children under the age of ten years who reside at the home." A "small family day care home" is a "home that provides family day care for eight or fewer children, including children under the age of ten years who reside at the home." (A small family day care home providing for more than six children shall meet the requirements of Section 1597.44 of the California Health and Safety Code or successor provision, and a large family day care home providing for more than twelve children shall meet the requirements of Section 1597.465 of the California Health and Safety Code or successor provision.) 
D.  Any person operating a large family day care home shall notify the planning office in writing of that fact and, pursuant to Section 1597.46(a)(2) of the California Health and Safety Code, shall obtain a large family day care home permit. Application for a permit shall be made to the planning office on the prescribed form, with the prescribed attachments, together with an application fee in the amount set from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
E.  A permit shall be granted to any person operating a large family day care home upon compliance with the following requirements: 
1.  The use of the single-family dwelling as a large family day care home shall meet all the requirements of Section 17.16.015 (Home businesses) of the Hillsborough Municipal Code except that meeting the provisions of subsections (B)(2) and (5) of that section shall not be required. For purposes of subsection (B)(8) of that section, the family day care home shall be held to the same standard as any other single-family dwelling, including, without limitation, compliance with the town's noise ordinance (Chapter 8.32 of the Hillsborough Municipal Code). 
2.  The large family day care home shall be licensed by the state of California. 
3.  The large family day care home shall comply with all applicable State Fire Marshal regulations, as certified by the Central County Fire. 
4.  The large family day care home shall be inspected annually by the Central County Fire. 
5.  If a parking strip, developed to town standards is not already in place, the owner or operator of the large family day care home shall install and maintain a parking strip along the full frontage of the site where the large family day care home is located, in accordance with the town's standards and in compliance with the requirements of the Hillsborough Municipal Code regarding parking strips. 
6.  If one or more employees work at the large family day care home, the owner or operator of the home shall provide one off-street parking space per employee. 
7.  The owner or operator of the large family day care home shall provide at least one parking space for the drop-off and pick-up of children. Such parking space may be located in the driveway of the single-family residence in which the large family day care home is operated, if, in the opinion of the city planner, there is adequate space to allow drop-off and pick-up without interfering with normal use of the driveway. 
F.  Any permit issued pursuant to this section shall be valid from the date of issuance for so long as the large family day care home is in compliance with this section and all other applicable laws.

    "Nonconforming use" or "legal nonconforming use" means a use that conformed to applicable law in effect when the use began but, by reason of subsequent amendment of such law, does not comply with the present requirements of this code. 
(Ord. 639 § 16, 2003) 
17.20.020 - Altering or rebuilding nonconforming structures in the absence of natural disaster. 
A.  Regarding encroachment into a setback area, a dwelling that is legally nonconforming because it encroaches into a setback area may be enlarged, reconstructed, or otherwise altered provided the encroachment does not extend further into the setback area if: 
1.  Such addition, reconstruction, or alteration does not amount to a complete reconstruction; 
2.  The height of any newly constructed or reconstructed portion of the structure within the setback area does not exceed twenty-two feet; 
3.  The fire chief and chief building official first determine that such enlargement, reconstruction, or alteration will not constitute a fire or safety hazard; and 
4.  The adjoining property owner(s) have been notified in writing of the proposed addition, reconstruction, or alteration and if such owner(s) have raised any objection, the proposal has been approved by the architecture and design review board after a public hearing noticed under Chapter 1.20. In considering whether to approve a proposal under this subsection regarding a dwelling (including, without limitation, a garage attached to such dwelling), the city council shall consider, and shall make findings as to whether approving the proposal will allow the replacement of a deteriorated or antiquated structure or portion thereof with a sound, properly designed and constructed structure or portion thereof, and whether approving the proposal will, or will not, be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or injurious to other properties in the town. 
5.  Second units are not subject to the provisions of this section but are subject to the non-conforming-use and nonconforming-structure provisions in Section 17.52.030. 
B.  Regarding encroachment into a setback area, an accessory structure that is nonconforming because it encroaches into a setback area may be enlarged, reconstructed, or otherwise altered provided the encroachment does not extend further into the setback area if: 
1.  Such addition, reconstruction, or alteration does not amount to a complete reconstruction; 
2.  The fire chief and chief building official first determine that such enlargement, reconstruction, or alteration will not constitute a fire or safety hazard; and 
3.  The adjoining property owner(s) have been notified in writing of the proposed addition, reconstruction, or alteration and if such owner(s) have submitted a written objection to the planning office, the proposal has been approved by the architecture and design review board after a public hearing noticed under Chapter 1.20. In considering whether to approve a proposal under this subsection regarding an accessory structure (including, without limitation, a garage attached to such accessory structure), architecture and design review board shall consider, and shall make findings as to whether approving the proposal will allow the replacement of a deteriorated or antiquated structure or portion thereof with a sound, properly designed and constructed structure or portion thereof, and whether approving the proposal will, or will not, be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or injurious to other properties in the town. 
C.  Notwithstanding subsection B. of this section, the architecture and design review board may grant a garage exception to the requirements of subsections B.1. and B.2. of this section to allow complete reconstruction of and/or increased encroachment into the setback for nonconforming garages if the council finds that granting such garage exception will allow the replacement of a deteriorated or antiquated garage (or structure used for garage purposes) with a sound, properly designed and constructed garage and that granting the exception will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or injurious to other property in the town. Subsection B.4. of this section shall apply; however, the written notice to the adjoining property owner(s) shall include the fact that a garage exception will be considered by the city council. The architecture and design review board need not hold a public hearing when considering a garage exception unless an adjoining property owner has filed a written objection to the proposed addition, reconstruction, or alteration. 
D.  Regarding nonconformance with the maximum allowable floor area ratio (FAR), any structure (accessory or nonaccessory) that is nonconforming because it and the other structures on the lot together exceed the maximum allowable floor area ratio (FAR), as defined in Section 17.32.030(B), or it exceeds the maximum square footage for an accessory structure or it exceeds the maximum allowable lot coverage (footprint) under Chapter 17.32, may be enlarged, reconstructed, or otherwise altered, (but not so as to amount to a complete reconstruction) if such addition, reconstruction, or alteration will not increase the net structural lot coverage (footprint) or net floor area that is not conforming. For example, a single-family dwelling having an FAR of twenty-seven percent may be remodeled (including removing and adding square footage) so that it has an FAR above twenty-five percent but not above twenty-seven percent. 
E.  Regarding nonconformance with height limitations, any structure (accessory or nonaccessory) that is nonconforming because it exceeds current height limitations may be enlarged, reconstructed, or otherwise altered (but not so as to amount to a complete reconstruction) without regard to current height limitations so long as such enlargement, reconstruction, or other alteration is confined to the existing building envelope of the structure. Any enlargement, reconstruction, or other alteration that would extend beyond the existing building envelope of the structure shall conform to current height limitations unless the Architecture and Design Review Board recommends otherwise, provided, however, that in no event shall any construction be higher than the existing structure. 
F.  It is not the intent of this section to limit repairs and regular maintenance that are necessary to maintain the safety or soundness of a structure.

17.20.030 - Rebuilding nonconforming structures destroyed by natural disaster. 
    In the event of a fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster, all or portions of a legal nonconforming structure shall be permitted to be rebuilt, to the same or a lesser degree of nonconformity as the destroyed structure or portion(s) of structure. Rebuilding shall not be permitted for any nonconforming structure or portion of structure that is intentionally removed.

(Ord. 683 § 8, 2008: Ord. 639 § 17, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 692, § 4, 9-3-2010) 
17.24.020 - Location of setback areas. 
A.  The street-line setback area is that twenty-five foot wide strip of land that is bounded on one side by the street line and on the other side by a parallel line on the lot and twenty-five feet distant from the street line, such parallel line continuing until either end of it abuts a lot line. If the lot is bounded by more than one street line, the area bounded by all street lines and their parallel lines twenty-five feet distant constitutes the street-line setback areas of the lot. The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the first diagram following the next paragraph. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A. of this section. 
1.  On property having frontage along a street or right-of-way established by easement (as opposed to dedication in fee), whether public or private, the outside boundary of the street-line setback area shall be the line between the easement and the remainder of the private property unencumbered by the easement, as illustrated by the second diagram below. 
    17.24.020: Location of setback areas (shown in plan view) 
    17.24.020A: 

    Example, on a corner lot, of street line setback areas where the "street" is a dedicated right-of-way. 
    17.24.020B.1: 

    Example, on a corner lot, of street line setback areas where the "streets" are easements for right-of-way purposes, rather than a dedicated right-of-way. 
2.  On property having frontage along a street or right-of-way established by public use, the outside boundary of the street-line setback area shall be the edge of the paved street abutting the private property in question. 
C.  The interior setback area is that twenty-foot wide strip of land that is bounded on one side by a lot line that is not a street line and on the other side by a parallel line located on the lot and twenty feet distant from the lot line, such parallel line continuing until either end of it abuts a lot line. If the lot is bounded by more than one lot line that is not a street line, the area bounded by all such lot lines and their parallel lines twenty feet distant constitutes the interior setback areas of the lot. Any lot area that, pursuant to the descriptions in this section, falls within both the street-line setback area and the interior setback area shall be deemed part of the street-line setback area and not part of the interior setback area. The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following diagram: 
    17.24.020C: Location of setback areas (shown in plan view): 

    Example of some interior and street line setback areas. Note that, for clarity, not all of the setback areas are shown for Lots A, B, and D. 
D.  Notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, no part of any dwelling shall be erected closer than fifty feet from the center line of any right-of-way; provided, however, that the maximum distance required by this paragraph between any part of the dwelling and the street line shall be thirty feet. (Any dwelling legally erected prior to the effective date of this subsection and not conforming to the provisions of this paragraph shall be a legal nonconforming structure and may be enlarged, reconstructed, or otherwise altered so long as the resulting dwelling is not any closer to the center line of any right-of-way and not any closer to the street line than the dwelling was prior to the alteration.) The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following diagrams:

    Example where the "street" is a dedicated right-of-way. 

    Example where the "street" is an easement for right-of-way purposes, rather than a dedicated right-of-way. 
E.  The diagrams in this section are illustrative only and not part of the ordinance. 
F.  Homes Eight Thousand Square Feet and Greater. On property improved with a single-family residence eight thousand square feet or greater in size, the street line and interior setbacks shall be increased in the aggregate by fifteen feet beyond what would otherwise be required under this chapter, with a minimum of five feet being added to the street-line setback and the balance being added to the interior setback. 
(Ord. 683 § 9, 2008; Ord. 639 § 17, 2003) 
17.24.030 - Measurement. 
A.  In determining compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the distance between a lot line and a structure located on the lot shall be measured along a line perpendicular to the lot line beginning at the lot line and continuing to the nearest measuring point (as defined in subsection B of this section) of the structure. 
B.  1.  The edge of the pavement on tennis and other play courts shall be the measuring point for such structures. 
2.  The edge of the coping, if any, of a swimming pool, spa, or hot tub shall be the measuring point. If there is no coping, the edge of the water in a swimming pool, spa, or hot tub shall be the measuring point. 
3.  The nearest exterior wall shall be the measuring point for buildings. 
4.  For all other structures, the edge of the structure shall be the measuring point. 
(Ord. 639 § 17, 2003) 
Chapter 17.28 - HEIGHT LIMITATIONS* 
Sections: 

17.28.010 - Building envelope. 
    A building envelope shall be established at every setback line, out of which no structure except chimneys shall penetrate; provided, however, that when Section 17.24.020(D) applies to a dwelling, the building envelope shall be established at that line past which no part of the dwelling may be erected. The envelope shall commence at existing grade at all setback lines, rising to a height of twenty-two feet directly above grade, then extending at a slope of forty-five degrees inward (away from the property line) to a maximum height of thirty-two feet measured from a warped plane parallel to existing grade. The following diagrams illustrates the building envelope profile, including the thirty-two foot height limitation, for zero and thirty percent slopes. 
    In the case of land that has not been altered from its natural state, "existing grade" means the natural grade. In the case of land that has previously been subject to grading, as defined in Section 15.24.020, "existing grade" means the grade that existed (as reasonably determined by the building department) five years prior to the date of the application for the building permit for the project for which the building envelope is being calculated.

(Ord. 639 § 18 (part), 2003) 
17.28.030 - Retaining walls. 
    The maximum allowable retaining wall height shall be six feet or such lesser height as set forth in Sections 12.12.050(B), 17.24.010(B)(1), and 17.24.010(C) as applicable. 
(Ord. 639 § 18 (part), 2003) 
Chapter 17.32 - RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE SIZE AND LOT COVERAGE* 
Sections: 

17.32.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the size of single-family dwellings and accessory structures and to provide for review by the city council of very large homes. This chapter does not apply to private schools, country clubs, private clubs, public facilities, and other structures not associated with single-family dwellings. 
(Ord. 639 § 20 (part), 2003) 
17.32.020 - Total covered floor area. 
A.  For purposes of Sections 17.32.030 and 17.32.040, the phrase "total covered floor area" shall mean the total area of all buildings on the lot (except for excluded accessory structures listed in this section) measured to the exterior wall lines thereof (i.e., the outside edge of exterior walls). This shall include all roofed areas with a level floor-to-ceiling height of at least seven feet, including basements as set forth in subsection C of this section, closets, stairwells, bay windows, turrets, and other projections bounded by two or more exterior walls, plus the additional amount of square footage, if any, specified by subsections B and D of this section. For purposes of this chapter, floor area includes finished or unfinished floor area. The foregoing notwithstanding, the following accessory structures shall be excluded from (i.e., not counted in) the floor area calculation: trellises, open gazebos, open pergolas, open decks, carports open on at least two sides, and other structures of a similar type as determined by the town's planning office. 
B.  For rooms or areas with low sloping ceilings, such as attics, all floor areas with a level floor-to-ceiling height of at least five feet shall be counted as floor area. 
C.  For basement areas with exterior walls less than two feet above the surrounding natural grade, thirty-three percent of all floor areas with a level floor-to-ceiling height of at least six feet shall be counted as floor area. For basement areas with exterior walls two feet or more above the surrounding natural grade, one hundred percent of all floor areas with a level floor-to-ceiling height of at least six feet shall be counted as floor area. The height of exterior basement walls shall be measured from the surrounding natural grade to the plate height of the ground-level floor above. 
D.  For spaces with high ceilings, one hundred and fifty percent of all floor area (after the first three hundred square feet, which shall be counted at one hundred percent) with a floor-to-ceiling height greater than twelve feet shall be counted as floor area. 
(Ord. 657 § 4, 2005; Ord. 639 § 20 (part), 2003) 
17.32.030 - Minimum and maximum dwelling size; FAR. 
A.  The total covered floor area shall be at least twenty-five hundred square feet. 
B.  The total covered floor area shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the net lot area for the first acre plus fifteen percent of the net lot area over one acre. This percentage is known as the floor area ratio ("FAR") and is calculated by dividing the total covered floor area (in square feet) by the net lot area (in square feet). 
C.  When five hundred square feet or less remain in the allowable floor area, a notice (prepared by the town) shall be recorded by the property owner to notify future owners that the square footage remaining for additional development of the property is minimal and that the building department should therefore be consulted as to whether any additional development is possible on the property. 
(Ord. 639 § 20 (part), 2003) 
17.32.040 - Floor area in excess of eight thousand square feet. 
A.  Except as set forth in subsection G. of this section, the design of any new dwelling having a total covered floor area, as defined in Section 17.32.020 A., in excess of eight thousand square feet shall not be deemed approved or conditionally approved, regardless of any recommendation of the architecture and design review board or the lack of a timely and proper appeal, until the project has been submitted to the city council for review and final disposition. 
B.  For purposes of this section, the total covered floor area shall be deemed to exceed eight thousand square feet if the floor area exceeds that number before the project is begun or will exceed that number after the project is finished or both. 
C.  Projects having a total covered floor area in excess of eight thousand square feet shall be submitted to the city council as follows: the submittal shall include, but not be limited to, all the written documentation that was presented to the architecture and design review board for its consideration, as well as the written record of the architecture and design review board's action made by the town staff following the board's meeting. 
D.  The submittal to the city council shall be noticed in the same manner as was required for the architecture and design review board's consideration of the project. 
E.  The city council's review shall include a public hearing and shall consider the following: 
1.  The project's compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies. 
2.  The recommendation of the architecture and design review board. 
3.  The project's aesthetic compatibility with the site and the neighborhood, including, without limitation, the impact of such square footage on the site and the neighborhood. 
F.  The city council shall either approve, conditionally approve, or deny the project, or instruct the applicant to make revisions to the design and resubmit it to the architecture and design review board for additional review. 
G.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, following design review by the architecture and design review board, the city planner may determine, in consultation with the commissioner for the planning office, that the city council review set forth in this section is not necessary because (i) there is no unresolved opposition to or concern about the project raised in the public hearing before the architecture and design review board and (ii) the project was approved by the architecture and design review board with no dissenting votes. 
(Ord. 654 § 23, 2004; Ord. 639 § 20 (part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 715, § 10, 6-9-2014) 
17.32.050 - Number and size of accessory structures. 
    There is no limitation on the number of accessory structures that may be allowed on a lot; provided, however, that each covered accessory structure shall not exceed one thousand square feet in floor area, except as otherwise set forth in Sections 17.52.020(C)(5) and (C)(6). 
(Ord. 654 § 25, 2004; Ord. 648 § 8, 2003; Ord. 639 § 20 (part), 2003) 
17.32.060 - Residential lot coverage. 
A.  For purposes of this chapter, there are three types of residential lot coverage: Structural coverage, hardscape coverage, and softscape coverage. 
1.  Structural coverage consists of areas of the lot covered by a house, a garage, a carport, and any other accessory structure having more than one wall and a roof. These shall be measured to their exterior wall lines or exterior supporting columns, but shall not include porches, entries, porticos, balconies, and the like (if such porches, entries, porticos, balconies, and the like are roofed and open on at least two sides) and shall not include roof overhangs, if all these excluded items together do not exceed, in area, ten percent of the maximum permitted structural coverage. Structural coverage is often referred to as the "footprint" of the above-described structures on the lot. 
2.  Hardscape coverage consists of areas of the lot located beneath a roof or covered by manufactured, non-plant pervious or impervious materials but does not include anything included in structural coverage. 
3.  Softscape coverage consists of all lot coverage that is not structural coverage or hardscape coverage. Examples of softscape are planted areas, dirt, indigenous grasses and woodland, gravel, and mulch. 
B.  The maximum surface area of a lot that may be covered by structural coverage is as follows: 
Lot Size (Net Lot Area) Maximum Area of Lot Permitted To Be Covered Up to 17,500 sq. ft. 22 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area 17,500 up to 21,780 sq. ft. 3,850 sq. ft. plus 15 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 17,500 sq. ft. 21,780 up to 32,670 sq. ft. 4,495 sq. ft. plus 10 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 21,780 sq. ft. 32,670 through 43,560 sq. ft. 5,585 sq. ft. plus 6 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 32,670 sq. ft. Over 43,560 sq. ft. 6,239 sq. ft. plus 5 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 43,560 sq. ft.  
C.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph B of this section, the combined total of structural plus hardscape coverage shall not exceed fifty percent of the net lot area; provided, however, that in any setback area adjacent to the street line, the combined total of structural plus hardscape coverage shall not exceed forty percent of such area. 
D.  Softscape coverage is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 17.56.040.

Chapter 17.36 - OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS* 
Sections: 
I. Residential Parking 

17.36.010 - Garage required. 
A.  Every newly constructed or substantially enlarged dwelling shall include a garage that meets the definition of "garage" in Chapter 17.08 and the requirements of this Chapter 17.36. No existing garage shall be removed or converted to something other than a garage unless another garage, meeting the requirements of this chapter, is constructed to replace the existing garage. 
B.  For purposes of this chapter, a "newly constructed dwelling" is one for which a building permit is issued for the construction of an entirely, or almost entirely, new dwelling. The preservation of a token amount of wall or similar structural part of an existing structure shall not prevent the construction from being deemed a "newly constructed dwelling." 
C.  For purposes of this chapter, a "substantially enlarged dwelling" is one for which a building permit is issued for the construction of an addition which results in a net increase in floor area that is greater than fifty percent of the dwelling's existing floor area. 
D.  If the construction does not constitute "a newly constructed dwelling" or a "substantially enlarged dwelling" but nonetheless includes the addition of one or more bedrooms and that addition brings to the total number of bedrooms to four or more, additional garage space(s) shall be provided, as necessary, to bring the dwelling into compliance with the minimum number of parking spaces set forth in Section 17.36.030. 
E.  For purposes of this chapter, a bedroom is a private room designed for or capable of being used for sleeping, separated from other rooms by a door and accessible to a bathroom (which includes a bathtub or shower) without crossing another room other than a hallway or open area. 
(Ord. 639 § 19, 2003) 
17.36.020 - Minimum size of parking spaces; required back-up space. 
    Each garage parking space shall be at least ten feet wide and twenty feet long and have at least seven and a half feet vertical clearance. Each unenclosed parking space shall be at least eight and one-half feet wide and eighteen feet long. Outside and directly in front of each garage door shall be a minimum unobstructed backup space at least twenty-five feet long (measured in a straight line from and perpendicular to the front of the garage doors) and twenty feet wide. The backup space shall be on private property and not in the public right-of-way. 
(Ord. 652 § 6, 2003; Ord. 639 § 19, 2003) 
17.36.030 - Minimum number of parking spaces; locations of parking spaces. 
A.  Every dwelling shall have at least the following number of parking spaces, depending on the number of bedrooms in the dwelling: 
Number of bedrooms Required minimum number of parking spaces 1 - 3 Two garage spaces* 4 - 5 Two garage spaces + one more, which may be unenclosed* 6 or more Two garage spaces + two more, which may be unenclosed*  
* Plus additional parking spaces (which may or may not be enclosed) as recommended by the architecture and design review board, based on the size and design of the dwelling and the size and configuration of the property. 
B.  Required garage spaces shall be usable independently of each other. In other words, garage spaces arranged in tandem shall be counted as one required garage space. For purposes of this chapter, spaces arranged in tandem are spaces arranged one behind the other such that only one of the spaces has access to the driveway without crossing over another parking space. 
C.  The required backup space in front of the garage doors shall not be counted as required additional parking spaces. 
D.  All required parking spaces shall be on the private property and not in the public right-of-way.

Chapter 17.40 - VARIANCES* 
Sections: 

17.40.010 - Permitted-When. 
    In cases where because of the particular size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of any lot or parcel, or where because of the physical condition of any lot or parcel with respect to trees or natural obstacles, a strict adherence to any requirement of this title is impractical or difficult to fulfill, the requirement may be modified by the city council by granting variance. 
(Ord. 639 § 21 (part), 2003) 
17.40.020 - Application-Fee-Public hearing.

1.  That because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of the zoning ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity. (Personal, family, or financial difficulties, loss of prospective profits, and neighboring violations or neighboring pre-existing nonconforming uses of facilities are not circumstances justifying a variance.) 
2.  That if granted, the variance would not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity. 
E.  Once the city council has granted a variance, the property owner shall apply for design review approval as set forth in Chapter 2.12 and as consistent with the variance granted.

Chapter 17.42 - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACTS 
Sections: 

17.42.010 - Purpose. 
    Housing that is accessible to people with disabilities has been identified as a special housing need in the town's housing element adopted in 2002, specifically Program 4-A2. The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to establish a formal procedure for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing to request reasonable accommodation under the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (42 USCS 3601 et seq.) and the state Fair Employment and Housing Act (California Government Code Section 12900 et seq.) ("the Acts") in the application of the town's zoning and other land use laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, procedures, and practices (hereafter "Land Use Rules"). The further purpose of this chapter is to establish relevant criteria for considering such requests. 
(Ord. 648 § 10, 2003) 
17.42.020 - Applicability. 
    A person with a disability (meaning a person with a "disability" as defined under the state Fair Employment and Housing Act or a person with a "handicap" as defined under the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988), that person's representative, or any entity may request reasonable accommodation when the application of a Land Use Rule acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a request for modification or exception to the Land Use Rules for the siting, development, and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of that person's choice. 
(Ord. 648 § 10, 2003) 
17.42.030 - Letter of request. 
A.  Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted by letter to the city planner and shall describe the requested accommodation and contain the following information:

(3)  Current actual use of the property. 
(4)  Basis for the claim that the individual is a person with a disability under the Acts. 
(5)  Land Use Rule regarding which reasonable accommodation is being requested. 
B.  No fee shall be required for submitting a letter of request under this chapter or filing an appeal under Section 17.42.050. 
(Ord. 648 § 10, 2003) 
17.42.040 - Review and decision. 
A.  The city planner shall review the request and make a written determination within forty-five days after receipt of the request. The written determination shall be consistent with the requirements of the Acts and shall at a minimum address the factors set forth in paragraph C below. 
B.  The city planner may grant, grant with modifications, or deny the request. In granting the request or granting the request with modifications, the city planner may impose any conditions of approval that the city planner deems reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation is consistent with the factors set forth in subsection (C) below. 
C.  The city planner's decision shall be based on consideration of the following factors: 
(1)  Whether the housing that is the subject of the request will be used by an individual with a disability under the Acts. 
(2)  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts. 
(3)  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the town. 
(4)  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a town program or law, including, but not limited to, land use and zoning. 
(5)  The physical attributes of the property and the structures on the property. 
(6)  The potential impact of the requested reasonable accommodation on surrounding properties. 
(7)  Alternative reasonable accommodation on the property. 
(Ord. 648 § 10, 2003) 
17.42.050 - Appeal. 
    The person or entity that requested the reasonable accommodation may appeal the city planner's denial of the request or may appeal the conditions or modifications imposed by the city planner on the grant of the request. The appeal shall be submitted to the city planner in writing within fifteen days after the date of the city planner's decision. The appeal shall be heard by the city council in a public hearing noticed pursuant to Chapter 1.20 using a type B public notice. 
(Ord. 648 § 10, 2003) 
17.42.060 - Effect of chapter. 
    This chapter shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Acts; nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to create greater rights than exist under the Acts.

17.52.010 - Definitions. 
    The term "living area" means the interior habitable area of a dwelling unit including basements and attics but does not include a garage or any accessory structure. 
    The term "second unit" means an "accessory dwelling unit" as defined by Government Code Section 65852.2, subdivision (i)(4): "an attached or a detached residential dwelling unit which provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. It shall include permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the single-family dwelling is situated. An accessory dwelling unit also includes the following: an efficiency unit, as defined in Section 17958.1 of the Health and Safety Code [and a] manufactured home, as defined in Section 18007 of the Health and Safety Code." 
    The term "attached second unit" means a second unit that is structurally attached to the primary dwelling but which has independent, direct access from the exterior. 
    The term "detached second unit" means a second unit that is not structurally attached to the primary dwelling. 
    The term "converted second unit" means a second unit that is created from the existing space of a single-family residence or accessory structure. Accessory structure here includes, but is not limited to, a studio, pool house, or other similar structure. 
(Ord. 648 § 11, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 743, § 2, 12-12-2016; Ord. No. 752, § 4, 1-14-2019) 
17.52.020 - General provisions. 
A.  This section is imposed pursuant to Section 65852.2 of the Government Code, relating to the creation of second units on lots that are zoned to allow single-family or multifamily use and that include a proposed or existing single-family dwelling. 
B.  This section allows a second unit to be (1) created within an existing dwelling; (2) created by converting an existing detached accessory structure (such as a freestanding cabana or pool house); (3) developed as a new detached accessory structure to an existing dwelling; (4) developed as part of an addition to an existing single-family home; or (5) developed in conjunction with construction of a dwelling, either as a detached or attached second unit. 
C.  The creation of a second unit shall be approved if all of the following requirements are met: 
1.  The property owner has submitted to the town an executed restrictive covenant, ready to be recorded, in which the owner covenants that (i) the second unit will not be sold separately from the primary dwelling and (ii) that the unit and the primary dwelling will not be rented at the same time unless both are rented to the same party. 
2.  The lot is zoned to allow single-family or multifamily use. 
3.  The lot includes a proposed or existing single-family dwelling. 
4.  For a second unit that is developed as a new detached accessory structure, as part of an addition to an existing single-family home or accessory structure, or in conjunction with the construction of a new primary dwelling, a second unit planning approval is required, as well as a building permit. 
5.  Second units that are created entirely within an existing legally created dwelling or accessory structure shall have independent exterior access from the primary dwelling unit and shall maintain side and rear setbacks sufficient for fire safety. The dwelling or accessory structure from which the second unit is converted must meet all the requirements of this title at the time of the conversion, except that a dwelling or accessory structure that is legally nonconforming as to setback may be converted to a second unit within the existing building structure. In accordance with state law, the town only requires a building permit for a second unit created in accordance with this paragraph. No second unit planning approval is required. 
6.  Attached and detached second units shall meet all of the following requirements: 
a.  Building Codes. The second unit must comply with all currently adopted building codes, including the residential and fire codes. 
b.  Floor Area. 
(1)  The total floor area of an attached second unit shall not exceed fifty percent of the living area of the primary dwelling or one thousand four hundred square feet, whichever is smaller. 
(2)  If a second unit is added to an existing detached accessory structure, the total floor area of the second unit portion of the accessory structure shall not exceed fifty percent of the living area of the primary dwelling or one thousand four hundred square feet, whichever is smaller; and the total floor area of the other (i.e., non-second unit) portion of the accessory structure may be as much as one thousand square feet; provided, however, that in all events the entire accessory structure (both the second unit and the non-second unit portions together) shall comply with the floor area ratio provisions set forth in Sections 17.32.020 and 17.32.030 and with the lot coverage provisions set forth in Section 17.32.060. 
(3)  The total floor area of a detached second unit shall not exceed one thousand four hundred square feet. 
(4)  The floor area of a second unit may be further limited as follows: 
(a)  In addition to the floor-area restrictions in subsections C.6.b.(1), (2), and (3) above, the total covered floor area of all dwellings and structures on the lot shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the net lot area for the first acre, plus fifteen percent of the net lot area over one area. This percentage is known as the floor-area ratio ("FAR") and is calculated by dividing the total covered floor area (in square feet) by the net lot area (also in square feet). 
(b)  When five hundred or fewer square feet remain in the allowable floor area, a notice (prepared by the town) shall be recorded by the property owner to notify future owners that the square footage remaining for additional development of the property is minimal and that the building department should therefore be consulted as to whether any additional development is possible on the property. 
c.  Height. 
(1)  The height of a detached second unit that complies with current setbacks may not exceed twenty-two feet, as measured from existing grade, as "existing grade" is defined by Section 17.28.010 of this code. 
(2)  The height of an attached second unit may not exceed twenty-two feet, measured from existing grade, as "existing grade" is defined by Section 17.28.010 of this code, unless the attached second unit is located entirely within the building envelope, as "building envelope" is defined by Section 17.28.010 of this code, in which case the second unit may be up to thirty-two feet high. 
(3)  The height of a second unit that lies within any required setback may not exceed fifteen feet, as measured from existing grade, as "existing grade" is defined by Section 17.28.010 of this code. 
d.  Setback. 
(1)  Generally. 
(a)  Street-Line Setback. 
1.  If the right-of-way is fifty feet wide or wider, then the setback for the second unit is twenty-five feet from the street line, as "street line" is defined by Section 17.08.260 of this code. 
2.  If the right-of-way is less than fifty feet but greater than or equal to forty-five feet wide, then the setback for the second unit is twenty-seven and one-half feet from the street line, as "street line" is defined by Section 17.08.260 of this code. 
3.  If the right-of-way is less than or equal to forty feet wide, then the setback for the second unit is thirty feet from the street line, as "street line" is defined by Section 17.08.260 of this code. 
(b)  Side. A second unit may not be located closer than twenty feet of a side property line. 
(c)  Rear. A second unit may not be located closer than twenty feet of the rear property line. 
(2)  Exception for Lots with a Large Home. On a lot with a single-family dwelling that has a floor area of eight thousand square feet or larger, the street line and interior setbacks shall be increased in the aggregate by fifteen feet beyond what would otherwise be required under this chapter, with a minimum of five feet being added to the street-line setback that is required under subsection C.6.d.(1)(a) and the balance being added to any interior setback or setbacks required under subsections C.6.d.(1)(b) or C.6.d.(1)(c) above. 
(e)  Lot Coverage. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, there are two types of residential lot coverage limits to which second units are subject together with the other dwelling and structures on the lot. These types are: structural coverage and hardscape coverage. 
(a)  Structural Coverage. 
1.  Structural coverage consists of areas of the lot covered by a dwelling, a garage, a carport, and any other accessory structure having a roof and more than one wall. 
2.  The maximum structural coverage of a lot is as follows: 
Table 17.52.020-1 
Lot Size (Net Lot Area) Maximum Area of Lot Permitted to be Covered Up to 17,500 sq. ft. 22 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area 17,500 up to 21,780 sq. ft. 3,850 sq. ft. plus 15 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 17,500 sq. ft. 21,780 up to 32,670 sq. ft. 4,495 sq. ft. plus 10 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 21,780 sq. ft. 32,670 through 43,560 sq. ft. 5,585 sq. ft. plus 6 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 32,670 sq. ft. Over 43,560 sq. ft. 6,239 sq. ft. plus 5 sq. ft. for each 100 sq. ft. or portion thereof of net lot area in excess of 43,560 sq. ft.  
(b)  Hardscape. 
1.  Hardscape coverage consists of areas of the lot located beneath a roof or covered by manufactured, non-plant, pervious or impervious materials but does not include anything included in structural coverage. 
2.  Examples include, but are not limited to: decking, a concrete slab or walkway, a gazebo with no walls (just a roof). 
(2)  Subject to the provisions of subsection C.6.e.(1)(a)1. above, the combined total of structural plus hardscape coverage shall not exceed fifty percent of the net lot area; provided, however, that in any setback area adjacent to the street line, the combined total of structural plus hardscape coverage shall not exceed forty percent of such area. 
f.  Architecture. 
(1)  The materials and colors of the exterior walls, roof, and windows and doors must match the appearance of those of the primary dwelling. 
(2)  The roof slope must match that of the dominant roof slope of the primary dwelling. The dominant roof slope is the slope shared by the largest portion of the roof. 
(3)  The exterior lighting must be limited to down-lights or as otherwise required by the building or fire code. 
(4)  The second unit must have an independent exterior entrance, apart from that of the primary dwelling. The second unit's entrance must be located on the side or rear building façade, not facing a public right-of-way. 
(5)  All second-story windows and doors in a second unit that are less than thirty feet from a property line that is not a street line shall either be (for windows) clerestory with the bottom of the glass at least six feet above the finished floor, or (for windows and for doors) utilize frosted or obscure glass. 
(6)  The architectural treatment of a second unit to be constructed on a lot that has an identified historical resource must comply with all applicable ministerial standards imposed by the Secretary of Interior. 
(7)  Outdoor showers are prohibited. 
g.  Landscaping. 
(1)  The second unit and primary dwelling must use the same driveway to access the street, unless otherwise required for fire apparatus access, as determined by CCFD. 
(2)  Evergreen landscape screening must be planted and maintained between the second unit and adjacent parcels as follows: 
(a)  At least one fifteen-gallon size plant shall be provided for every five linear feet of exterior wall. Alternatively, at least one twenty-four-inch box size plant shall be provided for every ten linear feet of exterior wall. This paragraph dictates the minimum number of required plantings, not the particular placement of those plantings. 
(b)  For a ground-level second unit, plant specimens must be at least six feet tall when installed. As an alternative, for a ground-level second unit, a solid fence of at least six feet in height may be installed. 
(c)  For a second-story second unit, plant specimens must be at least twelve feet tall when installed. 
D.  A second unit conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall not be considered to exceed the allowable density for the lot upon which the unit is located and shall be deemed to be a residential use consistent with the existing general plan and zoning designations for the lot. 
E.  A second unit, whether attached or detached, may have its own (separate) utility connections and meters or may be supplied from the utility connections and meters of the primary dwelling. 
F.  The renting of either the primary dwelling or the second unit shall not be considered a business and shall not be subject to the provisions of Chapter 5.04. 
G.  A second unit and primary dwelling may not both be rented at the same time unless they are both rented to the same party under the same lease. 
H.  Second units shall not be used for rentals with terms of thirty days or less. 
I.  A restrictive covenant (approved by the town) shall be recorded by the property owner to notify future owners of the requirements set forth in subsections C.1., G., and H. of this section. 
J.  Parking. 
1.  Every attached or detached second unit shall have one dedicated off-street parking space as follows: 
a.  All required parking spaces shall be on the private property and not in the public right-of-way; and 
b.  The parking space may be covered or uncovered and may be in setback areas or as tandem parking on an existing driveway; and 
c.  Each unclosed parking space shall be at least eight and one-half feet wide and eighteen feet long; and 
d.  Each parking space that is provided in an enclosed garage shall be at least ten feet wide and twenty feet long and have at least seven and one-half feet vertical clearance. 
2.  Notwithstanding subsection J.1. above, no parking space shall be required for an attached or detached second unit if the owner demonstrates that any of the following conditions applies: 
a.  The second unit is located within one-half mile of public transit. 
b.  The second unit is located within an architecturally and historically significant historic district composed of properties that are listed on a state or federal historical registry. 
c.  When on-street parking permits are required but not offered to the occupant of the second unit. 
d.  When there is a car share vehicle located within one block of the second unit. 
K.  Notice of Construction. 
1.  At least ten business days before starting any construction of a second unit, the property owner shall give written notice to all the owners of record of each of the adjacent residential parcels, which notice shall include the following information: 
a.  Notice that construction has been authorized, 
b.  The anticipated start and end dates for construction, 
c.  The hours of construction, 
d.  Contact information for the project manager (for construction-related complaints), and 
e.  Contact information for the town building division. 
2.  This notice requirement does not confer a right on the noticed persons or on anyone else to comment on the project before permits are issued. Approval is ministerial. Under state law, the town has no discretion in approving or denying a particular second unit project under this section. This notice requirement is purely to promote neighborhood awareness and expectation. 
(Ord. 654 § 24, 2004; Ord. 652 § 7, 2003; Ord. 648 § 11, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 688, § 2, 6-14-2010; Ord. No. 722, § 2, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 743, § 2, 12-12-2016; Ord. No. 752, § 4, 1-14-2019) 
17.52.030 - Nonconforming second units. 
A.  Generally. Regarding encroachment into a setback area, a second unit that is legally nonconforming because it encroaches into a setback area may be enlarged, reconstructed, or otherwise altered provided that the encroachment does not extend further into the setback area and each of the following requirements is satisfied: 
1.  Such addition, reconstruction, or alteration does not amount to a complete reconstruction; 
2.  The height of any newly constructed or reconstructed portion of the structure within the setback area does not exceed fifteen feet; and 
3.  The fire chief and chief building official first determine that such enlargement, reconstruction, or alteration will not constitute a fire or safety hazard. 
B.  Domestic Units. 
1.  All detached domestic units existing as of January 10, 1983, are nonconforming structures. (The term "detached domestic units" means living quarters designed, capable of being used, or intended to be used to house household help, such quarters being not structurally attached to the single-family dwelling served by the household help.) All alterations to or remodeling of nonconforming detached domestic units shall be confined to the interior of such structures; exterior improvements shall be limited to normal upkeep and repair and to such improvements as do not enlarge or alter the existing outside dimensions of the structure. 
2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a natural disaster (such as fire, earthquake, flood, landslide, etc.) damages or destroys a nonconforming detached domestic unit, the same may be reconstructed to the same or smaller outside dimensions as those of the damaged or destroyed structure. 
3.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an existing detached domestic unit that is converted to a second unit may be enlarged to a maximum floor area of one thousand four hundred square feet subject to the requirements of Section 17.52.020.C.6. 
(Ord. 648 § 11, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 722, § 3, 3-9-2015; Ord. No. 752, § 4, 1-14-2019) 
17.52.040 - Conversion of existing residential space. 
    Recognizing that there may be a considerable existing stock of potential second units in the town and that this stock represents a valuable housing resource for the community, the town wishes to encourage property owners to take advantage of this second unit ordinance. Accordingly, any property owner may apply to the town without penalty or fee for the purpose of converting existing residential space (such as guest suites, guest quarters, pool houses, carriage houses, domestic quarters, etc.) into a second unit in accordance with the provisions and requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. 648 § 11, 2003) 
(Ord. No. 688, § 3, 6-14-2010; Ord. No. 752, § 4, 1-14-2019) 
17.52.050 - Second unit exception review. 
A.  A second unit that does not complies with the standards in Section 17.52.020 may nevertheless be permitted by the director of building and planning, or the director's designee, at the director's or designee's discretion if the second unit undergoes the design review process set forth in Chapter 2.12 of this code. A second unit that does not comply with all the standards in Section 17.52.020 is considered a "type B project" under Section 2.12.070.A. 
B.  A second unit that complies with all the standards in Section 17.52.020 is approved ministerially in accordance with that section, as indicated by subsection 2.12.070(A)(2)(c)(ix).

Sections:

    The purpose of this chapter is to provide incentives for the production of housing for lower income households (which, as set forth in California Health and Safety Code Section 50079.5(b), includes very low and extremely low income households) and senior households in accordance with Sections 65915 through 65917 of the California Government Code. Section 65915 directs the town to provide density bonuses and/or other concessions or incentives under certain circumstances, as set forth in Section 65915 et seq., in order to encourage the construction of low income housing. (Density bonuses essentially allow more units per acre than would otherwise be permitted. Other concessions or incentives, for example, could include the reduction or waiver of permit fees and/or utility fees and/or the provision of financial assistance in constructing public improvements.) Section 65915 also directs the town to adopt an ordinance specifying how the town will comply with these provisions. 
(Ord. 648 § 12, 2003) 
17.60.020 - When applicable. 
    The town may grant a density bonus for projects meeting the requirements of California Government Code Section 65915.

A.  Any person wishing to apply for a density bonus and/or other incentives or concessions under Government Code Section 65915 (hereinafter "applicant") shall make a preliminary application in writing to the director of building and planning. The application shall identify what specific measures (e.g. modifications to standards, density bonus, or fee subsidies) the applicant is requesting. 
B.  The applicant shall provide all information available to the applicant that is necessary to determine if the proposed development comes within the provisions of Section 65915. 
C.  The building and planning director shall provide to the applicant a letter identifying project issues of concern, the financial assistance that may be available, and the procedures for compliance with this chapter.

4.  The project's compliance with the town's general plan, zoning, and development policies. 
D.  The city council shall grant the incentives or concessions unless the city council makes a written finding pursuant to Section 65915(d)(1). 
E.  A density bonus housing agreement shall be made a condition of the discretionary permits (e.g. tentative maps, parcel maps, development permits) for all housing developments for which a density bonus and/or additional incentives have been approved.
