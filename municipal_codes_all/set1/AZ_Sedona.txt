E. The city election in 2008 for members of the city council shall be called for the election of mayor, a two-year term, three council seats consisting of a four-year term, and one council seat consisting of a two-year term.

The city council finds that ongoing citizen engagement, public participation and community collaboration enhance local government’s effectiveness, expand its range of options, improve the quality of its decisions, and enlist the problem-solving capacities of the general public and organizations outside local government. The city council also recognizes that knowledge and talent are widely dispersed in society, and all benefit when those skills and abilities are directed toward common goals. The city council finds that public agencies and municipal authorities should collaborate with the general public and state, regional, and local government agencies, tribes, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and other nongovernmental stakeholders to accomplish public work and deliver public services more efficiently and effectively. The city council finds that the city of Sedona has, throughout its history as a municipal government, striven to engage citizens in different areas and aspects of municipal governance and through this new chapter seeks to further strengthen its commitment to citizen engagement, public participation and community engagement. [Ord. 2013-12 § 1, 12-10-2013; Res. 2013-31 Exh. A, 12-10-2013].

2.100.020 Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following words or phrases shall have the following meanings:
“Policy process” means any action developing, implementing, or enforcing public policy, including but not limited to identifying and defining a public policy issue, defining the options for a new policy framework, expanding the range of options, identifying approaches for addressing an issue, setting priorities among approaches, selecting from among the priorities, implementing solutions, project management, and assessing the impacts of decisions.
“Public participation” is defined to include “public comment,” “public hearing,” “public engagement,” or “community engagement,” includes, but is not limited to, any form of in-person, technology-aided, or online communication that provides for discussion, dialogue, or deliberation among participants, allowing residents to engage meaningfully in the policy process. [Ord. 2013-12 § 1, 12-10-2013; Res. 2013-31 Exh. A, 12-10-2013].

2.100.030 Citizen engagement plan.
A. It is hereby declared a matter of public policy that the active public participation of community members to come together to deliberate and take action on public problems or issues that they themselves have defined as important is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, and welfare of the community. 
B. The city and its municipal departments may use any process that meets the principles for citizen engagement, public participation and community collaboration set forth in SCC 2.100.040 in addition to notice and comment or public hearings required by law.
C. The city shall adopt and make publicly available a citizen engagement plan to guide the city’s use of participation strategies satisfying the principles for public participation set forth in SCC 2.100.040. [Ord. 2013-12 § 1, 12-10-2013; Res. 2013-31 Exh. A, 12-10-2013].

2.100.040 Principles for citizen engagement, public participation and community collaboration.
A. The following principles shall govern the design of citizen engagement, public participation and community collaboration:
    1. Inclusive Design. The design of a public participation process includes input from appropriate local officials as well as from members of intended participant communities. Public participation is an early and integral part of issue and opportunity identification, concept development, design, and implementation of city policies, programs, and projects.
    2. Authentic Intent. A primary purpose of the public participation process is to generate public views and ideas to help shape local government action or policy.
    3. Transparency. Public participation processes are open, honest, and understandable. There is clarity and transparency about public participation process sponsorship, purpose, design, and how decision-makers will use the process results. 
    4. Inclusiveness and Equity. Public participation processes identify, reach out to, and encourage participation of the community in its full diversity. Processes respect a range of values and interests and the knowledge of those involved. Historically excluded individuals and groups are included authentically in processes, activities, and decision and policymaking. Impacts, including costs and benefits, are identified and distributed fairly.
    5. Informed Participation. Participants in the process have information and/or access to expertise consistent with the work that sponsors and conveners ask them to do. Members of the public receive the information they need, and with enough lead time, to participate effectively.
    6. Accessible Participation. Public participation processes are broadly accessible in terms of location, time, and language, and support the engagement of community members with disabilities.
    7. Appropriate Process. The public participation process uses one or more engagement formats that are responsive to the needs of identified participant groups; and encourage full, authentic, effective and equitable participation consistent with process purposes. Participation processes and techniques are well-designed to appropriately fit the scope, character, and impact of a policy or project. Processes adapt to changing needs and issues as they move forward.
    8. Use of Information. The ideas, preferences, and/or recommendations contributed by community members are documented and given consideration by decision-makers. Local officials communicate decisions back to process participants and the broader public, with a description of how the public input was considered and used.
    9. Building Relationships and Community Capacity. Public participation processes invest in and develop long-term, collaborative working relationships and learning opportunities with community partners and stakeholders. This may include relationships with other temporary or ongoing community participation venues.
    10. Evaluation. Sponsors and participants evaluate each public participation process with the collected feedback and learning shared broadly and applied to future public participation efforts. [Ord. 2013-12 § 1, 12-10-2013; Res. 2013-31 Exh. A, 12-10-2013].

2.100.050 Citizen engagement coordinator.
A citizen engagement coordinator under the direction of the city manager’s office shall perform a key role in soliciting, organizing, reporting and celebrating citizen engagement, public participation and community collaboration in community issues. [Ord. 2013-12 § 1, 12-10-2013; Res. 2013-31 Exh. A, 12-10-2013].

2.100.070 Community training.
The city shall work with public and private sector partners to provide periodic training opportunities for community members that are interested in learning more about citizen engagement, public participation and community collaboration. [Ord. 2013-12 § 1, 12-10-2013; Res. 2013-31 Exh. A, 12-10-2013].

5.10.010 Purpose.
The city council desires to regulate peddling and solicitation within the city in a manner so as to ensure to the residents the maximum amount of privacy and security in their own homes that is permissible in light of court decisions mandating certain types and amounts of access to residential areas by peddlers and solicitors. It is, therefore, the intent of the city council in enacting this chapter to recognize the extensive single-family residential nature of the city and the city’s unique geography and topography, resulting in narrow unlit streets, while providing opportunity for peddlers and solicitors as mandated by law. This chapter should be interpreted so as to be in conformity with relevant state and federal court decisions, including but not limited to Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., v. Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150, 122 S. Ct. 2080, 153 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2002). [Code 2006 § 8-1-1.

5.15.080 Operating requirements for cable communication systems.
A licensee shall conform to the following minimum standards relative to the construction, operation and maintenance of a cable communications system in the city. It is not the intent of this section to prevent any licensee from providing more than the required minimum to meet the standards listed below:
A. Rights of Individuals, Subscribers and Users. 
    1. A cable system shall be operated in a manner consistent with the principles of fairness and equal accessibility of facilities, channels, studios and other services to all residents and other entities having a legitimate use of the system. A licensee shall not discriminate in terms of rates, terms of service or extension of service on the basis of age, race, creed, sex, religion, national origin or marital status, except that a licensee shall not be prohibited from periodically discounting or waiving monthly service rates or installation fees as part of any promotional or marketing campaign. Nor shall a licensee fail to extend service to any part of the city on the basis of the income of the residents.
    2. A licensee shall maintain a business office open during normal business hours with listed local or toll-free telephone numbers to allow reasonable access by subscribers and members of the public. Unless a waiver is granted by the council, the office shall be located within the city’s corporate limits. When the office is closed, an answering machine, answering service or similar device, capable of receiving service complaints and inquiries, must be employed.
    3. A licensee shall maintain a written or electronic log listing date of all complaints, identifying the subscriber or citizen, describing the nature of the complaint and when and what action has been taken by the licensee, if any, in response thereto; such record shall be kept at licensee’s office and shall be available for inspection during regular business hours without further notice of demand of the city manager. A summary of such records must be retained for not less than one year. The licensee shall notify each subscriber at the time of initial subscription to service of the procedure for reporting and resolving complaints.
    4. A licensee shall establish procedures for the investigation and resolution of all complaints including, but not limited to, those regarding the quality of service and equipment malfunction. A copy of such procedures shall be provided to the council upon request.
    5. At the time cable service is installed, a licensee must provide each subscriber the following:
        a. Written instruction for placing a service call, filing a complaint or requesting an adjustment, including the name, title, phone number and address of the appropriate persons at licensee’s office;
        b. The telephone number of the city office responsible for administration of the cable license;
        c. A schedule of rates and charges for all available services;
        d. Copies of the service contract, including disconnect and reconnect procedures and charges; and
        e. A subscriber handbook and, upon request, any other written policies applicable for subscribers.
    6. A licensee shall establish and conform to the following policy regarding refunds to subscribers and users:
        a. If the licensee collects a deposit or advance charge on any service or equipment requested by a subscriber or user, the licensee shall provide such service or equipment within 30 days of the collection of the deposit or charge or it shall refund such deposit or charge within five days thereafter upon request of the subscriber. The subscriber must be advised of this right of refund at the time the order is placed.
        b. If any subscriber or user terminates any monthly service during a period of time for which the subscriber or user has made an annual or other payment in advance, the appropriate pro rata portion of the payment shall be refunded by the licensee.
    7. The following requirements shall apply to disconnections:
        a. There shall be no charge for total disconnection of cable service unless such charge was disclosed at the time the subscriber ordered service. All cable communications equipment shall be removed within a reasonable time from a subscriber’s property at the subscriber’s request, such time not to exceed 30 days from the date of the request.
        b. If any subscriber fails to pay a properly due monthly subscriber’s fee or other charge, the licensee may disconnect the subscriber’s service outlet; provided, however, that such disconnection shall not be effected until 30 days after the due date of the charges and shall include a prior written notice to the subscriber of the intent to disconnect. After disconnection, upon payment in full of all proper charges or fees, including the payment of any reconnection charge, the licensee shall reinstate the service within five working days.
    8. A licensee may interrupt service on the cable system only for good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations, only after prior notice to subscribers and the council of anticipated interruption. No prior notice shall be required for the performance of system maintenance work requiring a maximum of one hour between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m., and four hours between the hours of 12:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
    9. A licensee shall at all times comply with the subscriber privacy provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section 551.
    10. No equipment shall be installed by the licensee for subscriber service without first securing a service request from the owner or resident of any private property involved, except in public utility easements.
    11. A licensee shall not originate or knowingly permit subliminal transmission at any time for any purpose whatsoever.
    12. A licensee shall provide leased access channels as required under 47 U.S.C. Section 532. In the event that the federal provisions should cease to apply, the city and a licensee shall confer, mutually agree upon and then promulgate new leased access requirements which shall apply.
    13. A licensee shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity requirements of the FCC, 47 U.S.C. Section 554, state statutes and local regulations as the same may be amended from time to time.
B. Cable System Construction Timetable. 
    1. A cable system shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions of the license agreement.
    2. It is the policy of the council to require construction of a cable system designed to serve subscribers in an area licensed by the council as rapidly and expeditiously as possible. The licensee shall immediately, upon granting of the license agreement, diligently pursue and obtain all necessary permits from the appropriate governmental agencies, utility companies and others as necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and city laws, codes and resolutions. However, no construction shall begin until the notification requirements set forth in this chapter are satisfied.
    3. A cable system shall be constructed pursuant to a construction timetable specified in the license agreement.
    4. Any delay beyond the terms of the timetable specified in the license agreement will be considered a violation of the terms of this chapter and the license agreement. Unless the licensee can establish that the delay was due to factors beyond its control, the licensee may be considered in default of the license agreement and the city manager may take whatever action the city manager is entitled to under this chapter and the license agreement.
    5. The licensee shall not be considered in default of the applicable construction schedule if the council approves a modification of the schedule change in advance. In submitting a request for a construction schedule modification, the licensee must fully explain the reasons for the delay in writing. The delay may be disapproved by the council if it is not reasonably justified, would have unreasonably discriminatory results or would unduly delay service to an area. Such a modification request shall be considered granted unless the licensee is notified by the council to the contrary in writing within 45 days of the date on which the request was filed.
    6. The council may require a licensee to report on construction progress and provide information showing specifically whether the construction schedule is being met and the reasons for the delay. The city manager shall determine the format to be used for the report and the frequency of reporting.
    7. Where appropriate and reasonable, a licensee shall schedule construction activities to coordinate with any city construction on streets so as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience to the public.
C. Line Extension Policy. Unless the license agreement provides otherwise, a licensee shall be required to extend its cable system pursuant to the following requirements.
    1. Upon reasonable request for service by any person located within any area of the city that meets density requirements of subsection (C)(2) of this section, a licensee shall, within 60 days, furnish the requested service to such person, unless prevented from providing the service due to factors outside licensee’s control such as permit restrictions, private easement considerations, and the like. If such service has not been implemented within 90 days of the request, the council may impose liquidated damages for each day thereafter.
    2. The licensee must extend and make cable television service available to every unserved dwelling unit within any area of the city reaching the minimum density of at least 25 dwelling units per mile of plant as measured from licensee’s nearest activated trunk or feeder line, whether the existing plant is aerial or underground, except that the licensee shall not be required to install cable where another authorized licensee has already done so. Licensee shall complete line extensions to an area reaching a density of at least five homes within 1,056 feet of existing active cable plant, or where an area has more than five homes with at least one home per 211 street feet including the distance to existing active cable plant. Upon request, this density requirement may be modified by the council for a specific licensee, provided the licensee demonstrates that it would be commercially impracticable to comply with the requirement. For purposes of this section, a density requirement may be considered commercially impracticable if licensee’s compliance with the requirement would create a significant adverse impact on the capital costs of licensee’s city cable system.
    3. In new single-family subdivisions, the licensee shall prevent unnecessary damage to streets and property by installing cables or conduits underground at the same time and in the same trench as telephone, electric or similar services are installed; provided, that a licensee is entitled to joint-trench privileges with such other utilities and services under the same terms and conditions as granted by the city to other service providers using the trench. Given reasonable notice, the licensee shall install underground cable or conduit in all new subdivisions of four or more dwelling units within the service area at the same time and in the same trench as telephone, electric or similar services are installed. Cable need not be installed and activated until the new subdivision meets the criteria established for line extensions.
    4. The licensee must extend and make cable television service available to any resident requesting connection within the licensee’s authorized service area at the regular installation charge if the connection to the resident would require no more than a 200-foot drop line, provided subsection (C)(2) of this section is met.
    5. With respect to requests for connection requiring a drop line in excess of 200 feet, the licensee must extend service to such residents at a one-time charge not to exceed the actual costs incurred by the licensee for the distance exceeding 200 feet.
D. Construction and Technical Standards. The following general requirements, which are not to be interpreted as imposing standards in excess of FCC imposed limits, apply to all licensees.
    1. In those areas and portions of the service area where the transmission and distribution facilities of the telephone company and the electric company are underground or later placed underground, the licensee shall likewise install its transmission facilities underground.
    2. In areas where existing facilities are not underground, a licensee shall not erect poles along any street or public way of the city except as may be reasonably required or necessary to fill small gaps in the existing aerial utility systems and only then with the advance written approval of the director of the department of community development pursuant to Chapter 12.15 SCC.
    3. All television signals transmitted on a cable system must include stereo, when available, and any closed-captioned information for the hearing impaired. Antennas, supporting structures and outside plants used in the system must be designed to comply with the recommendations of the Electronics Industries Association and applicable federal and local regulations on tower structures and outside plants.
    4. The licensee shall design and install the system so as to be capable of operating according to the technical standards and all applicable rules and regulations of the FCC or any future rule-makings or standards required by the FCC. The licensee’s methods and schedules for testing the system on an ongoing basis shall be in compliance with its standard policies. A summary of any test results shall be provided by licensee for the city’s review upon request by the city manager.
    5. A licensee must not design, install or operate its facilities in a manner that will interfere with the signals of any broadcast station, the electrical system located in any building, the cable system of another licensee, or individual or master antennas used for receiving television or other broadcast signals.
E. Maintenance Specifications. 
    1. The licensee shall construct, install and maintain its cable system in an orderly and workmanlike manner in accordance with Chapter 12.05 SCC, which deals with construction and maintenance work in the public rights-of-way. The safety of the general public, the licensee’s employees, the employees of the utility companies and all nearby property owners shall be a primary concern.
    2. All cables are to be installed, to the maximum extent possible, parallel with electric and telephone distribution facilities. Multiple-cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel and bundled to the maximum extent possible.
    3. As between licensee and the city, the licensee shall be solely and completely responsible for the actions taken by any contractor or other agent employed to construct, install or maintain the licensee’s facilities on streets as well as on public or private property.
    4. The licensee shall give prior written notice, as set forth later in this section, of its intent to place underground facilities. Failure to provide such notice may subject a licensee to liquidated damages pursuant to SCC 5.15.090, or other enforcement sanctions.
    5. In addition, the licensee shall comply with all other city, state and federal laws and regulations which may be applicable to its operations.
    6. A licensee shall have available at all hours personnel capable of responding to emergency conditions requiring immediate repair to any facility owned by the state, county, city, or the gas, electric and telephone utilities, as well as pipeline companies or similar industries. The licensee shall respond to normal requests for location of its facilities within 48 hours. The licensee shall be a member of the One Call Notification Center, or comply with state underground law, for its service area.
    7. In the event that licensee property or the facilities and equipment of an unauthorized cable communication provider have been installed in a street or other dedicated public right-of-way without complying with the requirements of this chapter, or the license has been terminated, revoked or expired, or the use of any licensee property is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of three months, licensee or any unauthorized cable communication provider shall, at its sole expense, on the demand of the council remove promptly from the street all licensee or unauthorized cable communication provider property other than that which the council may permit to be abandoned in place. Upon such removal of subject property, licensee or unauthorized cable communication provider shall promptly restore the street or other public places from which the subject property was removed to a condition as near as possible to its prior condition. Subject property no longer in service may be left in place with the approval of and in a manner prescribed by the council. Upon abandonment of the property in place, licensee or unauthorized cable communication provider shall deliver to the council an instrument transferring ownership of the subject abandoned property to the city. Any cost arising from compliance with this provision shall be borne by the licensee or unauthorized cable communication provider.
F. Use of Streets. 
    1. A licensee must utilize, with the owner’s permission, existing poles, conduits or such other facilities whenever possible.
    2. All transmission lines and other equipment must be installed and located to minimize interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of public and private property owners. The council reserves the right to issue such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of cable systems in the public rights-of-way, as may be consistent with this chapter, state and federal law.
    3. The licensee shall have at all times up-to-date route maps or an electronic database showing trunk and distribution lines. Licensee shall make all such maps available for review by the appropriate city personnel. If the data is in graphic digitized format, it shall be converted to AutoCad 10.0 or higher suitable for the MS DOS System and provided to the city.
    4. Suitable safety devices and practices as required by city, state and federal laws, ordinances, regulations and permits must be used during construction and maintenance of a cable system.
    5. A licensee must remove, replace or modify, at its own expense, any of its facilities within any public right-of-way when required to do so by the city manager to allow the city to change, maintain, repair, improve or eliminate a public thoroughfare. Nothing in this section shall prevent licensee from seeking and obtaining reimbursement from sources other than the city.
    6. On streets where electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground, either at the time of initial construction or subsequently, the cable must also be located underground at the licensee’s expense. Between a street or road and subscriber’s residence, the cable must be located underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located underground. If either electric or telephone are aerial, licensee may install aerial cable except where a property owner requests underground installation and agrees to bear the additional cost over aerial installation.
    7. A licensee must obtain any required permits before doing any excavation or causing disturbance to public thoroughfares or private property as a result of its construction or operations and must restore to their former condition such private property and public thoroughfares, the latter in a manner consistent with all applicable rules, regulations, resolutions or other requirements relative to construction, repair or maintenance of public rights-of-way. If, in the opinion of the city engineer, such restoration is not satisfactorily performed within a reasonable time, the city engineer may, after prior notice to licensee, cause the repairs to be made at the expense of the licensee. The city engineer may inspect ongoing construction and require a licensee to halt construction where the city engineer finds the construction to be in noncompliance with the requirements of this chapter, the license agreement or a permit.
    8. Prior to commencement of underground construction a licensee must:
        a. Have received a permit from the city engineer for construction on public property or rights-of-way; and
        b. Have requested and received clearance from utilities in the area of construction.
    9. At the request of any person holding a valid building moving permit and upon sufficient notice, the licensee must temporarily raise, lower or cut its wires as necessary to facilitate such move upon not less than seven days’ advance notice. The direct expense of such temporary move must be paid by the permit holder, and the licensee may require payment in advance.
G. System Services and Capability. 
    1. The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply to licenses. The council may require that a licensee exceed these minimum requirements.
        a. Except as provided in the license agreement, a cable system must have a minimum capability of 54 video channels available for immediate or potential use. Two-way capability shall be designed into the system. Upon request by a licensee, this minimum channel capability may be modified by the council for a specific licensee, provided the licensee demonstrates that it would be commercially impracticable to comply with the requirement. A licensee shall have the burden of demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that compliance with the minimum channel capacity would be commercially impracticable for its city cable system.
        b. Standard installation and basic service to public buildings may be required without charge, as set forth in the license agreement, if the buildings are within 200 feet of a licensee’s system. Licensee may be required to make available one service outlet to a conveniently accessible point in each school, police station, fire station and City Hall, or other facility or building located within the license area and used for public purposes as may be designated by the city manager. The installation charge to each occupant, if any, will not exceed licensee’s direct cost (time and material).
        c. A licensee may be required to design its system to allow the council to interrupt audio and video portions of the cable service in an emergency to deliver information to subscribers.
        d. A licensee must provide standby power for the head end so as to be able to operate some channels during a power outage for a minimum of six hours or as otherwise provided for in the license agreement.
    2. The council may waive minimum requirements for licenses where the applicant demonstrates that such waiver is in the public interest.
    3. The following requirements apply to access channels:
        a. Applications for a license shall include proposals for the provision of public, educational and governmental access channel sufficient to meet community needs during the term of the license as determined by the council. A licensee or applicant shall specify what grants, if any, it is willing to make for studio equipment and facilities to be used for local program production by all cable access users. Applicants are encouraged to include proposals for local origination programming by the licensee.
        b. All access channel operations must conform to the following minimum requirements:
            i. Access channels shall be carried on the licensee’s lowest priced service offering.
            ii. A licensee shall have no editorial control over the content of the programming carried on public access channels. The council may require a licensee or other entity to manage the access program and to establish reasonable rules for the use of access channels consistent with the requirements of this chapter, the license agreement and the intended purpose of such channels.
            iii. The use of any public access channel and studio shall be made available to any city resident on a first-come, first-served nondiscriminatory basis, subject to rules and regulations specified in the license agreement.
            iv. The use of any educational access channel shall be made available free of charge to schools and other qualified educational institutions for the transmission of local educational programming.
            v. The use of any local government access channels shall be made available free of charge to the council for the transmission of government-related programming.
            vi. The licensee shall submit to the council on an annual basis a plan for publicizing access programs and access use.
        c. At the request of a licensee, the council may promulgate rules under which channel capacity dedicated to access use may be used by the licensee when it is not being used for access purposes.
H. Interconnection. 
    1. A licensee shall not be required to connect nor prohibited from interconnecting its cable system with other systems operated by the licensee, or with other systems in the city, in nearby cities or in the county which are operated by other licensees, where such action, as determined by the licensee, is contractually, economically and technically feasible.
    2. Upon request of the council to interconnect a licensee’s system with another licensee’s system, the licensee shall initiate preliminary negotiations with the other affected system in order to determine and report to the council the contractual, economical and technical feasibility of such requested interconnection.
I. Each licensee shall carry, as part of the basic service on its cable system, the signals of the local broadcast television stations in the area as required and defined by applicable law or current or future FCC regulations. [Code 2006 § 12-1-8. Ord. 91-20, 12-10-1991].

5.15.090 Fees, bonds, letters of credit, liquidated damages and appeals.
A. Application Fee. Each application for a license to be granted under the authority of this chapter shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount specified below, by certified or cashier’s check made payable to the city. Nonrefundable filing fees in the following amounts are required:
    1. For an initial license or renewal: $5,000.
    2. For consent to transfer or change ownership: $2,500.
    3. For license modifications:
        a. Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 545: $2,500.
        b. Any other modification: up to $2,000.
B. License Fee. 
    1. In consideration of the fact that the streets of the city will be used by a licensee in the operation of its cable system within the boundaries of the city and the streets are valuable properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and in consideration of the costs incurred by the city in regulating and administering each cable license, the licensee shall pay to the city up to five percent of the licensee’s gross annual revenue from all sources attributable to the operations of the licensee within the licensed area.
    2. This payment shall be computed quarterly, for the preceding quarter, as of March 31st, June 30th, September 30th and December 31st of each year. Each quarterly payment shall be due and payable no later than 30 days after the relevant computation date. Each payment shall be accompanied by a financial report showing in detail the gross revenues of the licensee related to that quarter.
    3. The payment required pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the city pursuant to any other applicable ordinance or provision of the city code, or regulation or law of the county, state or federal government.
    4. A license fee not received in full by the city within 30 days of its due date shall be deemed delinquent and subject to a late fee. The late fee for delinquent payment shall be five percent of the amount overdue plus interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or parts thereof.
    5. Where the license fee is based on gross revenues, the licensee shall file, with each license payment, a statement of the gross revenues for the period on which the fees are based. Such a licensee must file within three months of the end of its fiscal year a statement of gross revenues for the preceding year which is either audited or certified as accurate by an officer of the licensee. Any payment of license fees to adjust for a shortfall in the quarterly payments for the preceding year must be made no later than the filing date for the audited annual statement of gross revenues. Adjustments for any overpayment will be credited to subsequent quarterly payments. Interest and late charges (as specified above) will not be imposed for any payment necessary as a result of the yearly adjustment if the payment to correct the shortfall does not exceed five percent of the total payments made during the preceding year. In the event such payment exceeds five percent, the licensee is liable for interest and late charges for the entire amount due.
    6. The city manager shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to inspect or audit during normal business hours a licensee’s records showing the gross revenues and other relevant underlying data and information. Upon examination of such information, the city manager has the right to recompute any and all amounts paid under a license. Any additional amounts due the city as a result of an audit shall be paid by the licensee within 30 days following written notice to the licensee by the council, which shall include a copy of the inspection or audit report. In the event that an inspection or audit results in additional monies owed the city in excess of five percent of the total paid, the licensee shall bear the total cost of the audit, and late charges and interest on the additional amount due.
    7. No acceptance by the council of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the council may have.
C. Performance and Security Bond. 
    1. Within 30 days after the execution of the license agreement and prior to any construction work in the public right-of-way, the licensee shall file with the city manager a performance and security bond, or a letter of credit in a form acceptable to the city manager, in the city’s favor in the amount of $75,000, or as specified in the license agreement. This performance and security bond shall serve as security for the faithful and reasonable performance by the licensee of all the material provisions of the license agreement including the construction of system facilities along public rights-of-way and easements.
    2. The bond shall be issued by a surety company authorized to do business in the state and shall be in a form approved by the city manager, and contain the following endorsement:
    This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 30 days after receipt by the council, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew.
    3. Unless contested by the licensee in good faith as provided for herein, in the event it is determined, after observation of the proceedings provided for herein, that a licensee has failed to comply with any of the material provisions of this chapter or the license agreement, then such bond may be surrendered to the city upon written demand of city as compensation for damages as set forth by the city in connection with performing or securing performance of the provisions of the license agreement by the licensee.
    4. Such damages shall be recoverable jointly and severally by the city from either the principal or its surety, or both, for any and all damages and costs which the city may have suffered. These damages or costs shall include, but not be limited to, attorneys’ fees, costs of any action or proceeding, and the full and actual amount of any compensation, indemnification, cost of removal or abandonment of any property or other costs due and owing the city up to the full amount of such bond.
    5. The rights reserved by the city with respect to the bonds required are in addition to all other rights and remedies the council may have under this chapter, the license agreement or any other law.
    6. Failure to maintain the performance and security bond as required shall constitute a material violation of the provisions of this chapter.
    7. At such time as 95 percent of planned construction in the city is complete, as specified in license agreement, the council may, at licensee’s request, reduce or eliminate the performance and security bond requirement.
D. Damage Claims Procedures. 
    1. All license agreements shall contain provisions for liquidated damages, in amounts as mutually agreed upon between the city and the licensee, for any failure by the licensee to comply with various requirements of this chapter or the license agreement.
    2. All references to notices which are required as the result of the assessment or contemplated assessment of liquidated damages by the city, or of any intention by the city to draw upon the principal and surety of the performance and security bond as a result of such assessments, and such responses thereto by the licensee, shall be by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
    3. Prior to assessing any of the liquidated damages set forth herein, the city manager shall give the licensee 30 days’ written notice of its intention to assess such damages. In the notice, the city manager shall set forth, at a minimum, the following:
        a. Amount to be assessed;
        b. Actual basis for such assessment;
        c. Specific license provision alleged to have been violated; and
        d. The provisions of this chapter or the license agreement under which the assessment is authorized.
    Upon receipt of such notice, the licensee shall, during the 30-day period afforded by the notice, make a reasonable effort with the city to resolve and cure the violation. If the violation is not resolved within the period or within such other time agreeable to the city, the city manager shall then give the licensee written confirmation within 30 days of such resolution that the city intends to cancel its claim. If, however, the licensee disputes the intended assessment or that any violation has occurred, the licensee shall appeal the assessment within 15 days from the date of receipt of the city’s assessment letter in accordance with the provisions of subsection (F) of this section.
    4. Liquidated damages will not be assessed or imposed by the city if the city manager finds, in his or her opinion, that a failure by the licensee resulted from conditions entirely beyond the licensee’s control. Liquidated damages may be reduced or eliminated by the city if the city manager finds that a failure by a licensee resulted, partially or entirely, from a misunderstanding of obligations or from an excusable oversight. The licensee shall bear the burden of proof in establishing the existence of such conditions or misunderstandings.
    5. The imposition and collection of liquidated damages as set forth above shall not prevent the city from pursuing other remedies for other violations of either the city laws or regulations or the license agreement and for which liquidated damages have not been imposed and collected.
E. Liquidated Damages. 
    1. For failure to substantially complete major planned construction or line extensions as required, unless the council specifically approves a delay caused by the occurrence of conditions beyond the licensee’s control, the licensee shall pay $250.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, that the deficiency continues after licensee has been given notice of such deficiency and time to respond or cure the matter according to subsection (D) of this section.
    2. For substantial failure or repeated failure to comply with any of the material provisions of this chapter or the license agreement, the licensee shall pay $200.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues after licensee has been given notice of such noncompliance and time to respond or cure the matter according to subsection (D) of this section.
    3. For failure to comply or remedy any other provision of this chapter or the license agreement, the licensee shall pay $100.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, that such noncompliance continues after licensee has been given notice of such noncompliance and time to respond or cure the matter according to subsection (D) of this section.
    4. For failure to provide data, documents, reports and information in a timely manner as required, the licensee shall pay $50.00 per day, or part thereof, that each occurrence continues after the licensee has been given notice of such violation and time to respond or cure the matter according to subsection (D) of this section.
    5. For failure or refusal to substantially comply with reasonable directives of the city manager which are in accordance with city laws or regulations, the license agreement or any police powers of the city, the licensee shall pay $50.00 per day for each day, or part thereof, that each occurrence continues after the licensee has been given notice of such noncompliance and time to respond or cure the matter according to subsection (D) of this section.
F. Appeals. 
    1. In the event that licensee contests the city manager’s assessment of liquidated damages or fails to respond to the above-mentioned notices, within 14 days the city manager shall convene an administrative hearing as specified in subsection (F)(1)(a) of this section. Licensee may pay the fine, proceed with this hearing or waive its rights to this administrative hearing and proceed directly to the public hearing before the council, as specified in subsection (F)(1)(b) of this section.
        a. This shall be an administrative hearing, and licensee shall be afforded procedural due process including an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence. Within 14 days after the conclusion of such administrative hearing, the city manager shall issue a determination. In that determination the city manager may:
            i. Find that licensee is not in violation of this chapter or the license agreement;
            ii. Find that licensee is in violation of this chapter or the license agreement, but that the violation was with just cause and waive part or all of any penalty that might otherwise be imposed;
            iii. Find that licensee is in violation of this chapter or of the license agreement, take corrective action and foreclose on all or any appropriate part of the performance bond provided for elsewhere in this chapter; and
            iv. Find that licensee is in material violation of this chapter and the license agreement and recommend that the council declare the licensee in violation and terminate the license agreement, provided the council takes such action after a public hearing as set forth in subsection (F)(1)(b) of this section.
        b. If a public hearing before the council is requested by a licensee or is held pursuant to subsection (F)(1)(a) of this section, it shall be de novo, and it shall convene within 30 days of the request thereof. The licensee shall be afforded full due procedural process including, without limitation, an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence. The council’s decision, which shall include findings of fact and conclusions, shall be made not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing. In that decision the council may:
            i. Find that the licensee is not in violation of this chapter or the license agreement;
            ii. Find that the licensee is in violation of this chapter or the license agreement, but that the violation was with just cause and waive part or all of any penalty that might otherwise be imposed;
            iii. Find that the licensee is in violation of this chapter or of the license agreement, take corrective action and foreclose on all or any appropriate part of the performance bond provided for elsewhere in this chapter; and
            iv. Find that the licensee is in material violation of this chapter and the license agreement and declare the licensee in violation and revoke the license agreement pursuant to SCC 5.15.100.
    2. In the event a licensee disputes the decision of the council to revoke or suspend its license agreement, the licensee may submit the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction for final determination.
    3. When any part of this chapter or a license agreement is in dispute, or when any performance of a licensee or the city is in dispute, other than a decision to revoke or suspend a license, and after the applicable procedures of this section or any similar procedures of a license agreement have been fully exhausted, either the city or a licensee may elect to appeal the disputed matter to a court of competent jurisdiction for a final determination. [Code 2006 § 12-1-9. Ord. 91-20, 12-10-1991].

5.15.100 Termination – Revocation.
A. Termination. The license shall terminate, upon the expiration of the term thereof, unless renewal is successfully applied for, pursuant to SCC 5.15.110.
B. Revocation. 
    1. A license may be revoked or suspended by the council on the following grounds, taking into account any ameliorating circumstances:
        a. A licensee fails or repeatedly fails to comply with one or more material provisions of this chapter or the license agreement, and is unable or unwilling to resolve or cure such noncompliance;
        b. A licensee makes willful false or misleading statements in any application, filing or formal documents;
        c. A licensee engages in the practice of any fraud or deceit upon the city or subscribers in any application or during the term of the license agreement; and
        d. A licensee is unable or unwilling to pay its debts or is judged bankrupt.
    2. In the event the city determines that licensee is in material violation of this chapter or the license agreement, the city manager shall make written demand to the licensee that it come into compliance with the terms, conditions or performance obligations.
    3. The licensee shall have 60 days following receipt of such written demand by the city to coordinate with the city manager and cure the violation or to effect such cure within a period of time acceptable to the city manager. In the event the licensee fails to cure the violation, or is unable or unwilling to do so, the city manager may recommend the revocation or suspension of the license to the council, specifying with written particularity the reasons for such action. If, however, the licensee contests the action of the city manager or disputes that a violation has in fact occurred, the licensee shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the city manager’s original written demand for compliance to provide written notice to the city of such dispute.
    4. In the event the city manager recommends to the council that the license be revoked or suspended, a copy of such recommendation shall be served on the licensee by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, at the same time that the recommendation is forwarded to the council. The licensee shall be given at least 30 days’ advance written notice of the date scheduled for a public hearing before the council to consider the revocation or suspension recommendation. At such hearing the licensee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence, call witnesses and make argument.
    5. During the public hearing, the council shall consider the recommendation of the city manager, the response of the licensee and the responses from any other interested persons, and shall determine whether a violation has occurred and, if so, whether such failure warrants the revocation or suspension of the license, or some lesser appropriate penalty, in accordance with the provisions herein described.
    6. If the council finds that a violation did not occur, the matter shall be ended. If, however, the council finds that the violation by the licensee was partially or entirely with just cause, the result of a misunderstanding or through an excusable oversight, the council may direct the licensee to comply within a reasonable time and manner according to such terms and conditions as are reasonable.
    7. If the council finds that the licensee has violated one or more material provision of this chapter or the license agreement, or determines that one or more of the conditions in subsection (B)(1)(b), (c) or (d) of this section exists regarding the license, the council may provide a specified period of time for the licensee to come into compliance before the revocation takes effect.
C. System Disposal. In the event of termination or revocation of a license, the licensee involved shall offer to sell the cable system, at the fair market value, to a new licensee or applicant for a license. The fair market value shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted appraisal procedures. The original cost of all tangible and intangible property, as well as salvage value, book value, replacement cost, cash flow and other factors will be considered. Under no circumstances shall any valuation be made for any right or privilege granted by license. Should the licensee fail to negotiate a sale, as described above, the city may purchase the system at the fair market value for the purpose of leasing to a qualified operator until a buyer can be found, pursuant to the provisions of A.R.S. Section 9-509.
D. Continuity of Service. Licensee shall provide continuous service for the entire term of the license agreement to all subscribers and users in return for payment of the established rates, fees and charges. If licensee seeks to sell or transfer, or if the city revokes or fails to renew the license, licensee shall continue to operate the system as trustee for its successor in interest until an orderly and lawful change of operation is effected. This period of operation shall not exceed 120 days from the occurrence of any of the above events. Revenues accrued during that period of time shall be received by the operator. During such time, the cable system shall be operated under terms and conditions consistent with the most recent license agreement and this chapter. [Code 2006 § 12-1-10. Ord. 91-20, 12-10-1991].

5.15.110 Renewal.
A. If a licensee decides to initiate a formal license renewal process in accordance with 47 U.S.C. Section 546, it must notify the council within 30 to 36 months prior to the license expiration date.
B. In considering a renewal application, the council must consider whether:
    1. The licensee has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing license and applicable law;
    2. The quality of licensee’s service, including signal quality, customer service complaint resolutions and billing practices (without regard to mix, quality or level of cable services), has been reasonable in light of community needs;
    3. The licensee has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities and equipment set forth in its renewal proposal; and
    4. The licensee renewal proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.
C. If the council’s assessment is that the license should not be renewed, the council may commence an administrative hearing in accordance with 47 U.S.C. Section 546.
D. The provisions of 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a) through (g) notwithstanding, a licensee may submit an application for renewal in accordance with 47 U.S.C. Section 546(h), which affords a cable operator the opportunity to submit a proposal for the renewal of a license at any time. The council may, after adequate public notice and comment, grant or deny such proposal.
E. The renewal of a license does not become effective until any renewal fees have been paid by the licensee. [Code 2006 § 12-1-11. Ord. 91-20, 12-10-1991].

5.15.120 Transfers and change of control.
A. A licensee shall not sell, transfer, assign, exchange or release, or permit the sale, transfer, assignment, exchange or release of more than 49 percent of the cumulative ownership of the system without prior written authorization from the council. For the purposes of this section, a merger or consolidation shall be deemed a transfer or assignment. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit a pledge or hypothecation, or mortgage or similar instrument transferring conditional ownership of the system’s assets to a lender or creditor in the ordinary course of business, unless such interests shall exceed 75 percent of the original cost or the fair market value, whichever is higher.
B. A licensee shall not sell, transfer, assign, exchange or release, or permit the sale, transfer, assignment, exchange or release of the license agreement without prior written authorization from the council. For the purposes of this section, a merger or consolidation shall be deemed a transfer or assignment.
C. In no event shall any transfer, assignment, exchange or release of the license agreement by a licensee be approved by the council without the transferee accepting the terms and conditions of the license agreement, and any pending obligations or violations of the current licensee, by written notice to the city. This written notice of acceptance shall be received no less than 30 days prior to the proposed approval of the council. [Code 2006 § 12-1-12. Ord. 91-20, 12-10-1991].

5.15.130 Indemnity – Insurance.
A. The licensee shall, at its sole expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city and, in their official capacity, its officials, boards, commissions, agents and employees thereof, from and against any and all claims, suits and actions, liability and judgment or damages or otherwise:
    1. For actual or alleged injury to persons or property, including loss of use of property due to an occurrence, whether or not such property is physically destroyed, in any way arising out of or through, or alleged to arise out of or through, the acts or omission of a licensee or its officers, agents or employees, or to which the licensee’s officers’, agents’ or employees’ acts or omissions in any way contribute;
    2. Arising out of or alleged to arise out of any claim for damages for invasion of the right of privacy, for defamation of any person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of any person, firm or corporation in connection with a licensee’s operation of the system in the city; and
    3. Arising out of or alleged to arise out of the licensee’s failure to comply with the provisions of any statute, regulation or ordinance of the United States, the state or any local agency applicable to the licensee in its business.
B. The city and licensee shall cooperate in the licensee’s defense of any litigation. However, nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the city, so indemnified and held harmless herein, from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at their sole expense. The city shall give written notice to a licensee of such action. Such participation shall not under any circumstances relieve the licensee from its duty of defending against liability or of paying any judgment entered against such party.
C. In the event that a licensee does indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city as provided for in this section or in the license agreement, then the licensee’s liability and obligations shall be limited to the actual amount of any damages finally agreed upon by the licensee and the city or by a court of competent jurisdiction, together with reasonable expenses actually arising out of the construction, maintenance or operation of the licensee’s system to which the city has been made a party.
D. The licensee, within 30 days after written notice of the granting of a license, shall provide the city with and maintain in full force throughout the term of the license agreement, insurance issued by a company duly authorized to do business in the state, insuring with respect to the installation, construction, operation and maintenance of the system as follows:
    1. Comprehensive general and automobile liability coverage including, but not limited to, blanket contractual liability, completed operations liability, broad form property damage including but not limited to coverage for explosion, collapse, underground hazard and automobile nonownership liability. Specific amounts shall be described in the license agreement, but at no time shall this insurance be written in amounts less than the following:
        a. Comprehensive general liability: $500,000 combined single limit, bodily injury and property damage;
        b. Comprehensive automobile liability: $500,000 combined single limit, bodily injury and property damage; and
        c. Excess umbrella liability, covering all the above mentioned hazards, in the minimum amount of $1,000,000.
    2. Workers’ compensation coverage as required by the laws and regulations of the state.
    3. All insurance policies required herein shall include the city as a named insured party.
    4. Licensee shall be solely responsible for all premiums due and payable for insurance required herein. At the time of acceptance of the license agreement, licensee shall submit to the city a certificate of insurance, in a form approved by the city manager, listing city as “additional insured” and confirming that a satisfactory policy is in effect. This policy may be renewed on its anniversary throughout the term of the license agreement. Any cancellations or modifications of coverage shall require 30 days’ advance written notice to both the city and the licensee by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
E. Some or all of the provisions of subsection (D) of this section may, in the discretion of the city, be satisfied by proof of self insurance. [Code 2006 § 12-1-13. Ord. 91-20, 12-10-1991].

5.15.140 Administration.

During the term of the license agreement, the council reserves the right during normal business hours and upon the giving of reasonable notice to examine, audit, review and obtain copies of licensee’s contracts, engineering plans, accounting, financial data and service records relating to the property and operations of the licensee and to all other records required to be kept pursuant to this chapter. A licensee shall make all reasonable efforts to maintain and provide upon request, accounting, financial data and service records specific to the city-licensed area to facilitate timely and accurate analysis.
B. Licensee Rules and Regulations. Upon request of the city manager, copies of rules, regulations, terms and conditions adopted by the licensee for the conduct of its business shall be provided to the city manager.
C. City Manager. The city manager or his or her designee shall have responsibility for the day-to-day administration of cable communication operations within the city as governed by this chapter and the applicable license agreements. The city manager shall be empowered to take all administrative actions on behalf of the council except those actions which are specifically reserved to the council or another city office or officer. [Code 2006 § 12-1-14. Ord. 91-20, 12-10-1991].

5.15.150 General provisions.
A. Nondiscrimination. Licensee shall not deny service, access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, users or residents of the city. Licensee shall comply at all times with all applicable federal, state and city laws, rules and regulations, executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunities and requirements.
B. Laws and Codes. Licensee shall comply fully with all applicable local, county, state and federal laws, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations.

Further, this chapter is designed to allow dining area tables to be placed adjacent to a restaurant, allowing pedestrians to stroll by while customers dine undisturbed for so long as they shall not impede the efficiency, safety or requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, related to the pedestrian path.

5.30.030 Sidewalk dining permit required.
A. The sidewalk dining permit is a temporary encroachment license which may be denied, suspended or revoked for any conduct which is contrary to this section or for conduct of the business in such a manner as to create a public nuisance or constitute a danger to the operator’s or public’s health, safety, or welfare. This chapter creates no property right, title or interest.
B. It shall be unlawful for any person to create, establish, operate, maintain or otherwise be engaged in the business of running an outdoor dining area or place outdoor dining area items upon the sidewalks or public property in the city unless a currently valid permit is issued and maintained under the terms of this chapter.
C. A permit shall be issued only to a validly licensed business that wishes to provide dining furniture on the public or private property directly adjacent to the business for an outdoor dining area to be used by the general public. [Code 2006 § 7-14-3. Ord. 2010-18 § 1, 12-14-2010; Res. 2010-33 Exh. A, 12-14-2010].

A. Service of alcohol beverages in all sidewalk dining areas shall be limited to persons seated at tables in the sidewalk dining site. In the case of sidewalk dining areas having an alcohol beverage license, food service shall be required to be available at all times the sidewalk dining area is open.
B. Liability insurance covering the city of Sedona and the sidewalk dining area owner for the licensed sidewalk dining site will be required, including insurance to cover liquor liability, to the extent specified by the city engineer.
C. Each sidewalk dining area serving alcohol beverages shall be responsible for policing the sidewalk dining area to be sure that customers are of the legal drinking age and that alcohol beverages are not removed from the premises. [Code 2006 § 7-14-4. Ord. 2010-18 § 1, 12-14-2010; Res. 2010-33 Exh. A, 12-14-2010].

5.30.050 Prohibited conduct.
A. No merchant, vendor, business or property owner shall:
    1. Place any furniture on any portion of the public property other than as allowed in this chapter and by the terms and conditions of a sidewalk dining permit. In no event shall such items be placed in the landscaped areas or extend beyond the bounds of the permittee’s business or the borders approved by the city public works department. For the purposes of this chapter, the “bounds of the permittee’s business” means that furniture must be located alongside, but not beyond, the corners or ends of the permitted establishment’s outside walls. The sidewalk dining area will be made to conform to a specific location as set forth in the permit, and will be designed so as to ensure that there is adequate right-of-way for pedestrian travel.
    2. Fail to designate the sidewalk dining area by a physical barrier in a manner required by the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Controls. Any such barrier shall be removable and nonpermanent.
    3. Block or restrict a paved portion of the passageway to less than 60 inches in width or block the ingress/egress to any building. Also, no items shall be placed so as to block any doorway, driveway, crosswalk, or counter service window. Distance shall be measured along the paved portion of the passageway at the narrowest point between the outer edge of the sidewalk dining area border and the nearest immovable object on the sidewalk or to the front of the curb, or to the point where the sidewalk pavement ends, whichever is closer.
    4. Arrange the furniture so as to impede the efficiency of or pose a hazard to the pedestrian path or street corners. Any part of the furniture extending beyond the border of the sidewalk dining area shall violate this section. In areas of congested pedestrian activity, the public works department is authorized to require a wider pedestrian path for the protection and welfare of the public.
    5. Place or allow single or multiple tables for displays by organizations, establishments or businesses for vending goods, for distributing information or for displaying goods in the permitted sidewalk dining area as these activities encourage people to stop, loiter, overcrowd the sidewalk or obtain correct change, all of which potentially impedes the efficiency of the pedestrian path, and conflicts with the city’s style and ambience which the city seeks to preserve, unless sidewalk sale, special event or other appropriate permits have been granted pursuant to the issuance of a temporary use permit as authorized by the land development code.
    6. Sublicense the sidewalk dining area separately to nonoccupants of the premises.
    7. Use furniture and any other objects of such quality, design, materials, and workmanship that are not approved or otherwise authorized by the community development director, including but not limited to the following:
        a. Umbrellas or other decorative materials that are not fire retardant, pressure treated, properly secured to withstand strong winds or manufactured of fire-resistant material.
        b. Umbrellas, chairs or tables with advertising, signage or other writing on them.
    8. Fail to secure permission of the landlord where a building has multiple occupants.
    9. Operate a sidewalk dining area without the insurance coverage required in this chapter.
    10. Sound or permit the sounding of any device outdoors which produces a loud noise or use or operate any loudspeaker, public address system, radio, sound amplifier or similar device in violation of the city’s sound control ordinance as set forth in Chapter 8.25 SCC. For purposes of administering the sound control ordinance, the boundaries of the outdoor dining areas will be determined by reference to the permit diagram that is submitted with the application for a sidewalk dining permit. The city reserves the right to decrease noise levels of businesses if they interfere with public activities.
    11. Fail to pick up, remove and dispose daily all trash or refuse. Also, the permittee’s trash receptacles and bussing equipment shall not be permitted to remain in the sidewalk dining area after hours, but shall be stored indoors. Trash or refuse found within or emanating from the sidewalk dining area shall not be put in city sidewalk trash receptacles, but shall be placed in the business establishment’s receptacles.
    12. Fail to remove daily from the public right-of-way all grease, stains, food spots, liquid residues, etc., caused by the operation of the sidewalk dining area. All cleaning procedures and process must comply with the provisions of Chapter 13.50 SCC, concerning storm water discharge.
    13. Store, park, or leave any vehicle, truck, or trailer within the sidewalk dining area.
    14. Use the sidewalk dining area to place, display, or sell nonfood merchandise to the patrons of the establishment or to the general public.
    15. Use the sidewalk dining area to stock or store furniture or other items not in use.
    16. Place more chairs or tables beyond the number authorized in the sidewalk dining permit. [Code 2006 § 7-14-5. Ord. 2010-18 § 1, 12-14-2010; Res. 2010-33 Exh. A, 12-14-2010].

5.30.060 Application for sidewalk dining permit.

Such insurance shall name the city as an additional insured and shall provide that the policy shall not terminate or be canceled prior to the expiration date without 30 days’ advanced written notice to the city.
    6. Two copies and an original sketch to scale of the proposed location showing the layout and dimensions of the proposed sidewalk dining area.
    7. Proof of any required permit from the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Controls.

The sidewalk dining permit may be renewed annually so long as the applicant is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
C. The sidewalk dining permit required by this chapter shall be issued on a form prepared and deemed suitable by the city code enforcement department. The sidewalk dining permit shall contain, at a minimum, the following conditions:
    1. Each permit shall be effective for one year, from January 1st to December 31st, subject to annual renewal, unless revoked or suspended prior to expiration. No fees will be refunded.
    2. The permit issued shall be personal to the permittee only, and shall not be transferable in any manner.
    3. The permit may be suspended by the public works department when necessary to clear the public property for public safety or for a community or special event. Except in the case of an emergency, a minimum of 14 days’ advance notice will be provided to the permittee.
    4. The public works department may require the temporary removal of items within the sidewalk dining area when street, sidewalk, common areas or utility repairs necessitate such action.
    5. The permit shall be specifically limited to the area shown on the site plan attached to and made part of the permit.
    6. The sidewalk dining area covered by the permit shall be maintained in a neat and orderly appearance at all times, and the area shall be cleared of all debris on a periodic basis during the day and again at the close of each business day.
    7. No advertising is allowed in the sidewalk dining area except for the posting of menu items or prices on approved equipment or objects.
    8. No furniture or any other parts of the business shall be attached, chained, or in any manner affixed to any tree, post, sign, other fixture, curb or sidewalk within or near the permitted area.
    9. The issuance of a permit is temporary, and may be revoked pursuant to the provisions of SCC 5.30.070, and does not grant or imply any vested property rights to use of the area by the permittee.
    10. Dining area furniture and any other objects provided shall be maintained with a clean and attractive appearance and shall be kept safe and in good repair at all times.
    11. The city retains the right to suspend the privilege of using glass containers within the sidewalk dining area during major festivals and special events and when streets are closed. The use of glass containers will be revoked if an incident jeopardizes the health, safety and welfare of customers or the general public. Any violation of state or local laws will also result in a revocation of this privilege. Repeated offenses may result in revocation or denial of the sidewalk dining permit.
    12. The applicant must pay necessary sewer capacity fees for seats within the sidewalk dining area. In addition the applicant must pay monthly sewer fees in order for the permit to remain valid.
    13. The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the public works department that on-site infrastructure such as grease traps, collection systems, etc., are adequate for the increased discharges that will result from the additional seating created by the sidewalk dining area.
    14. The public works department may impose additional conditions to any permit that are reasonably related to ensuring the health, safety, aesthetics and efficient operation of the outdoor dining area. [Code 2006 § 7-14-5. Ord. 2010-18 § 1, 12-14-2010; Res. 2010-33 Exh. A, 12-14-2010].

    2. The permittee does not have insurance in force that is correct and effective in the minimum amount described herein.

    4. The permittee has failed to correct violations of this chapter or conditions of his permit upon receipt of the public works department’s notice of violations delivered in writing to the permittee.

If the action is taken based on subsection (A)(1), (2) or (3) of this section, the action shall become effective upon the receipt of such notice, and the permittee shall have four hours to remove the items.
C. Upon denial or revocation, the public works department shall give notice of such action to the applicant or the permittee in writing stating the action that has been taken and the reason thereof. The action shall be effective upon giving such notice to the permittee.

An appeal does not stay the denial or revocation of the sidewalk dining permit. The hearing shall be held within two working days from the date of notice of the request. The permittee or applicant may present witnesses, affidavits and any relevant documentary evidence. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply. The city engineer or his designee shall notify the permittee or applicant of the determination in writing.

8.10.080 Sign walkers.
A. Purpose and Intent. As set forth in the Sedona community plan, the city of Sedona maintains a vision of a city that is constantly vigilant over the preservation of its natural beauty, scenic vistas, pristine environment and cultural heritage, while at the same time being a city that fosters and enhances a strong and vital economy, which preserves existing lifestyles without exploiting the natural beauty. In 2008, the Arizona State Legislature enacted A.R.S. Section 9-499.13, which provided that all municipalities shall allow posting display and use of sign walkers but that they may also adopt reasonable time, place and manner restrictions. Therefore, in order to respect this legislative mandate while at the same time preserving the beauty, scenic vistas and pristine environment of the city and to avoid a proliferation of such signs thereby causing undue obstruction of traffic and pedestrians, the following reasonable restrictions on sign walkers are imposed. The provisions of this article are intended to comply with the mandate of this legislation, while at the same time promoting legitimate governmental goals and concerns as previously set forth in the Sedona community plan. Specifically, these provisions are designed to further ensure that sign walker activity does not interfere with traffic and pedestrian safety, nor does it obscure the scenic beauty of Sedona’s streets and highways. This section is directed solely to the regulation of the time, place and manner of certain limited forms of commercial speech with the general goal of ensuring safe unobstructed highways free from significant distractions to the motoring public in critical areas.
B. Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
“Business” means any individual or for-profit corporation or partnership engaged in a commercial activity designed to produce income or profit.
“Commercial message” means a message conveyed by a sign walker that is solely intended to interest, entice, or solicit any person to participate in commercial transactions with a business, including, but not limited to, offers of goods, cash, discounts on products or services, or other items, including the offering of free goods or services made in exchange for or with the intent to induce the recipient’s willingness to receive information relating to a possible commercial transaction.
“Sign walker” means a person who wears, holds, or balances a sign in order to convey a commercial message.
C. 
    1. Specific Prohibitions and Appropriate Conduct for Sign Walkers. In addition to the provisions of any other applicable term of this article, it shall be considered unlawful and a violation of this article for a sign walker to: 
        a. Engage in any form of sign walking activity without having first obtained a temporary sign walker permit from the city’s community development department;
        b. Interfere with or obstruct the free passage of any pedestrian on any street or sidewalk or obstruct or otherwise impede the free movement of any person or their access to or from any public street or sidewalk. Sign walkers shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians, bicycles and all others traveling or located on the sidewalks;
        c. Throw, place or deposit any solid waste, litter, paper, or handing out documents or handbills on any street or sidewalk or public or private place;

        b. No sign walker shall verbally solicit, hawk or call out to any pedestrian or to an occupant of a vehicle on a public street, whether the vehicle is moving, stopped, or parked; and
        c. No sign walker shall throw, toss, spin or otherwise maneuver a sign while displaying it.

    Exhibit A
    [IMAGE: <8.10.080.jpg>]
[Code 2006 § 9-2-8. Ord. 2008-14, 12-9-2008].

8.10.090 Off-premises canvassing.
A. Findings and Purpose. This section is based on the following findings and purposes:
    1. 
        a. Because of the proliferation of off-premises solicitation locations, particularly within the Sedona business district, and the fact that the volume of such activities has resulted in numerous complaints by pedestrians and tourists about the aggressive and persistent actions of such persons attempting to engage them in a conversation in order to consummate a business transaction, it is the intent of this section to preserve and protect the unique charm and small town character of the Sedona business district, which serves as a major attraction to millions of tourists each year.
        b. The city is committed to maintaining its small town character, scenic beauty and natural resources, which are the foundation of its economic strength and quality of life. (Sedona Community Plan Section 9.2, Recommendations Goal 1.0). These essential components of the city’s attractiveness to residents and visitors have been severely impaired by the practice of aggressive off-premises canvassing, particularly as practiced in the central tourist destination of the Sedona business district.
        c. Between 1996 and 2002, the city received copies of more than 150 written complaints as well as indications of numerous additional verbal complaints from visitors to the city regarding the aggressive off-premises canvassing activities conducted in the Sedona business district. A number of the complaining visitors described these activities as ruining the special character of the city which was their reason for visiting and expressed their determination not to return to the city because the aggressive off-premises canvassing had destroyed its attractiveness as a place to visit.
        d. This section is therefore directed solely to the regulation of the time, place and manner of certain limited forms of commercial speech with the general goal of requiring that person-to-person solicitation activities initiated by businesses or their representatives and directed toward the traveling public in the Sedona business district are confined to enclosed structures or on the actual business premises of the soliciting entity. This section is not intended to regulate any form of speech other than speech designed to do no more than propose a commercial transaction. Neither is this section intended to prohibit in any way the rights of the traveling public to inquire or seek information or initiate simple transactions from outside an enclosed structure.
        e. Given the unique commingling of both public and privately owned sidewalks throughout the Sedona business district which are equally accessible without restriction by tourists and pedestrians, the purposes of this section can only be made effective if the restrictions contained herein are applied to both public and private sidewalks.
    2. Tourism is essential to the city’s fiscal strength. Sedona’s “friendly, small town environment” has historically played a substantial role in making it an attractive tourist destination, by making the city a “gateway community” – such as a place to which visitors may come “to escape the congestion, banality, and faster tempo of life in the suburbs and cities.” (Sedona Community Plan Update 2001-2002 Draft March 2002, Part 15.1.) In 1996, it is estimated that between $77,200,000 and $85,100,000 in retail sales was attributable to visitor spending, and taxable visitor retail, lodging, and service industry expenditures were between $138,200,000 and $152,300,000, representing over 60 percent of all taxable expenditures in these categories. In fiscal 2000-2001, the city collected approximately $1,400,000 in bed taxes and $2,900,000 in city sales tax. Tourism is also the city’s leading employer, accounting for 1,600 jobs in direct employment and 800 jobs in indirect and induced employment. (Sedona Community Plan Update 2001-2002 Draft March 2002, Part 15.1.) Because the Sedona business district is a critical component of the city’s entire sales tax base, this section is further designed to protect the economic viability of this area by ensuring a pleasurable outdoor shopping experience uninhibited by repeated personal sales solicitations for the millions of tourists, which visit the area each year.
    3. This section is further designed to:

    2. An OPC review board shall be established and appointed by majority vote of the city council for a test period of one year from date of enactment to address, review, investigate and refer written complaints concerning violations of this section related to OPC solicitors or activities to the city attorney with any recommended actions.

Notice of such recommendation shall be given to the city attorney and to the complaining party. Recommend that the complaint be forwarded to the city attorney for consideration of further action pursuant to subsections (G)(1) through (4) of this section.
    3. The above procedures and any recommendations made by the OPC review board are advisory in nature and in no way limit the ultimate discretion of the city code enforcement office or the city attorney in determining whether or not to file or when to file civil or criminal charges.

    8.15.025     Enforcement and violations.

Article I. Nuisances Generally

8.15.010 Nuisances.
It is unlawful for any person to maintain a public nuisance. Anything which is injurious to health or indecent or offensive to the senses, or which interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property or anything which unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use in a customary manner of any public place, street, sidewalk or alley in the city, is a public nuisance and subject to summary abatement. [Code 2006 § 10-1-5].

Article II. Deceptive Misleading Advertising

8.15.021 Findings and purpose.
As set out in detail in Ordinance 2014-15, deceptive, misleading advertising has negatively affected the experience of tourists, visitors and residents and has created a disincentive for tourists and visitors to return. Such advertising destroys the small-town character of the city and creates confrontations between residents, visitors and merchants, thereby adversely impacting the health, safety and well-being of the public. These concerns are particularly present with timeshare or vacation club membership sellers and solicitors who have been known to implement misleading signage, as evidenced by a plethora of written and oral complaints documented by reference in Ordinance 2014-15. These complaints substantiate the fact that some signs used by timeshare and/or vacation club establishments in the city convey the clear impression that their sales solicitation establishments are instead nonprofit or government sponsored “tourist information centers” or are other types of establishments such as museums. Such deception has a negative impact on the tourism industry and economy of the city of Sedona. Negative experiences by visitors who have been lured into establishments believing that their sole purpose is that of dispensing tourist information are then disseminated to friends and acquaintances and are published on Internet social media and tourism sites, tarnishing the positive reputation of Sedona as a tourist destination site.
Because of these negative impacts on the health, safety and welfare of tourists, visitors and residents, deceptive and misleading advertising constitutes a public nuisance that must be addressed through enactment of rules and regulations designed to curb the proliferation of deceptive signs and advertisements. Therefore, the city council finds it necessary to impose additional regulations in order to prevent residents and visitors from mistakenly relying on representations that business establishments are official city, state or Chamber of Commerce visitor centers or other establishments that have no connection with sales solicitation activities. These regulations are further designed to protect residents and visitors against unreasonable interference or disturbance in their peace and against obstruction of free travel on city streets and sidewalks. The purpose of the regulations proposed in this section is to regulate activity which is commercial in nature and is not intended to prohibit free speech or any other constitutional rights. To that end, this article is designed to ensure that solicitors do not misrepresent the nature of the products they are promoting or the true nature or identity of the business behind any such promotion and to provide a means for regulating such activities and enforcing the provisions of this article. [Ord. 2014-15 § 1, 11-13-2014; Res. 2014-31 Exh. A, 11-13-2014; Ord. 2015-05 § 1, 4-28-2015; Res. 2015-08 Exh. A, 4-28-2015].

8.15.022 Definitions.
“Commercial solicitation” means any efforts by a solicitor or solicitor business intended to interest, entice, or solicit any person to participate in a present or future commercial transaction. Commercial solicitation is not intended to include routine conversations and interactions that are part of a normal retail business transaction such as ordering a meal or buying a drink, where the customer has knowingly placed their self in a situation where a reasonable person would anticipate that they would be asked questions about an anticipated purchase. Instead, such efforts include, but are not limited to, offers of products, either for sale, lease, exchange, or free, through person-to-person contact, telephone, mail, electronic mail, signage, handbills or other printed material, intended to induce the recipient’s willingness to receive information relating to a possible present or future commercial transaction.
“Person” means any individual, corporation, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, trust estate, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, and any other group or combination of individuals or entities.
“Product” means any tangible or intangible item including, but not limited to, goods, edibles, services, real property, timeshare interests, and club memberships.
“Solicitor” means a person who attempts directly or indirectly to encourage any person to enter into a present or future commercial transaction, including a vacation club membership or timeshare plan, through personal inducement, solicitation, or other means, including, but not limited to, invitations to sales presentations and offers for free or discounted products, or who by personal inducement, commercial solicitation, or other means encourages, or attempts to encourage, any person to participate in a present or future commercial transaction. Persons such as bartenders and waiters who respond to customers that have intentionally entered a business premises such as a bar or restaurant, or jeep tour guides who respond to questions about tours that are offered, are not considered solicitors.
“Solicitor business” means a person that engages in the business of employing or contracting with solicitors.
“Timeshare” or “timeshare plan” shall have the same meaning as defined in A.R.S. Section 32-2197.28.
“Vacation club membership plan” means an arrangement or agreement in which a purchaser in exchange for an advance fee and yearly dues is entitled to select from a designated list of facilities, accommodations or companies that operate in the United States through franchises or ownership, for a specified time period. Vacation club membership plans include, but are not limited to, arrangements and agreements set up by travel club services and retail travel club services. [Ord. 2014-15 § 1, 11-13-2014; Res. 2014-31 Exh. A, 11-13-2014; Ord. 2015-05 § 1, 4-28-2015; Res. 2015-08 Exh. A, 4-28-2015].

8.15.023 Provisions related to signs for vacation timeshare solicitors, vacation club solicitors, timeshare sellers and vacation club membership sellers.
A. Within the city of Sedona, all signage at all locations engaged in the commercial solicitation of vacation club membership plans, timeshares or timeshare plans, including, but not limited to, off-premises canvassing (OPC) locations, kiosks, or podiums located adjacent to public rights-of-way, shall contain the following information:
    1. The background color of the signage shall be of a color that is significantly different than the brown, green, and blue visitor information signage of the federal, state, and local governments; and
    2. The name of the business owning and/or operating the establishment shall be disclosed on the face of the sign in letters of sufficient size to be clearly readable to the public, but in no event less than 70 percent of the average size and font thickness of the largest sign text; and
    3. The words “Vacation Time Share Seller,” “Vacation Club Membership Seller,” “Vacation Ownership” or “Sales Solicitation” shall be printed and thereafter remain in an unobscured manner, and shall in no event be less than 50 percent of the average size and font thickness of the largest sign text in contrasting color and clearly readable to the public. [Ord. 2014-15 § 1, 11-13-2014; Res. 2014-31 Exh. A, 11-13-2014; Ord. 2015-05 § 1, 4-28-2015; Res. 2015-08 Exh. A, 4-28-2015].

8.25.020 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
“‘A’ weighted sound level” means the sound level as measured using the “A” weighting network with a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is dB(A). Sounds measured with the “A” weighting network approximate the response of human hearing when measuring sounds of low to moderate intensity.
“ANSI” means the American National Standards Institute which serves as the administrator and coordinator of the United States private sector voluntary standardization system. ANSI facilitates development of American National Standards (ANSs) by establishing consensus among qualified groups. ANSs in the fields of acoustics and sound measurement are developed by the Acoustical Society of America in order to standardize practices and equipment.
“Boom box” means a colloquial term for self-contained, portable, handheld music or sound amplification or reproduction equipment emitting sound that is audible at distances exceeding the permissible limits established within this chapter.
“Boom car” means a colloquial term for a personal or commercial vehicle with music amplification or reproduction equipment emitting sound that is audible at distances exceeding the permissible limits established within this chapter.
“‘C’ weighted sound level” means the sound level as measured using the “C” weighting network with a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is dB(C). The “C” weighting network is more sensitive to low frequencies than is the “A” weighting network.
“Commercial facility” means uses located within C1, C2, and C3 zoning districts, as defined in the city of Sedona Land Development Code.
“Community service facility” means any nonresidential facility used to provide services to the public, including but not limited to:
    1. Club meeting halls, offices and facilities;
    2. Organization offices and facilities;
    3. Facilities for the support and practice of religion;
    4. Private and parochial schools;
    5. Libraries, hospitals, medical facilities.
“Construction” means any site preparation, assembly, erection, repair, alteration or similar action, including demolition of buildings or structures.
“Continuous sound” means any sound with a duration of more than one second, as measured with a sound level meter set to the “slow” meter response. Impulsive sounds that are rapidly repetitive and have a duration of one second or longer, such as a jackhammer or hammer hoe, shall be measured as continuous airborne sound.
“Decibel (dB)” means a relative unit for the measurement of sound pressure. It is based upon a reference pressure of 20 micropascals (zero decibels) which is the average threshold of hearing for a human with acute hearing.
“Demolition” means any dismantling, destruction or removal of buildings, structures, or roadways.
“Emergency energy release device” means a device used specifically to release excess energy on a nonscheduled basis as necessary for purposes of safety and not as a part of routine process control.
“Emergency work” means any work or action necessary to deliver essential public services, including, but not limited to, repairing water, gas, electricity, telephone, sewer facilities, or public transportation facilities, removing fallen trees on public rights-of-way, dredging or repairing in any floodway or flood hazard area, or abating life-threatening conditions.
“Enforcement agency” means the city of Sedona code enforcement officer, sound control administrator, city of Sedona police officer or any other said persons as designated by the sound control administrator or police department.
“Engine compression braking” means the action taken by the operator of a diesel truck or bus to reduce speed by activating a device in order to secure compression braking of the engine.
“Extraneous sound” means a sound which is relatively intense, intermittent and of short duration and is neither part of the neighborhood residual sound, nor comes from the sound source under investigation. These sources of sound are noted, but excluded from all measurements.
“Frequency” means the time rate of repetition of sound waves in cycles per second, reported as Hertz (Hz). “Frequency” is sometimes colloquially referred to as “pitch.” Low frequency sounds can correspond to the bass notes in music. Low frequency sound waves travel farther and penetrate structures more efficiently than high frequency sound waves.
“Holiday” or “legal holiday” means any federal, state or city recognized holiday.
“Impulsive sound” means either a single pressure peak or a single burst (multiple pressure peaks) that has a duration of less than one second such as a car backfire, dynamite blast or other such single burst.
“Industrial facility” means any activity and its related premises, property, facilities, or equipment involving the fabrication, manufacture, or production of durable or nondurable goods.
“Motor vehicle” means any vehicle that is propelled other than by human or animal power on land.
“Muffler” means a properly functioning sound dissipative device or system for abating the sound of escaping gases on equipment where such a device is part of the normal configuration of the equipment. A motor vehicle is not considered to be properly muffled if its muffler is either malfunctioning or if it is equipped with an after-market muffler designed to increase the intensity of sound emissions over those of the stock muffler which was installed by the vehicle’s manufacturer.
“Multi-dwelling unit building” means any building comprising two or more dwelling units, including, but not limited to, apartments, condominiums, co-ops, multiple-family houses, townhouses, and attached residences.
“Multi-use property” means any distinct parcel of land that is used for more than one category of activity. Examples include, but are not limited to:
    1. A commercial, residential, industrial or public service property having boilers, incinerators, elevators, automatic garage doors, air conditioners, laundry rooms, utility provisions, or health and recreational facilities, or other similar devices or areas, either in the interior or on the exterior of the building, which may be a source of elevated sound levels at another category on the same distinct parcel of land; or
    2. A building which is both commercial (usually on the ground floor) and residential property located above, behind, below or adjacent.
“Neighborhood residual sound level” means that measured value which represents the summation of the sound from all of the discrete sources affecting a given site at a given time, exclusive of extraneous sounds, and those from the source under investigation. Neighborhood residual sound level is synonymous with background or ambient sound level. Neighborhood residual sounds are differentiated from extraneous sounds by the fact that the former are more steady state, although they may not be continuous.
“Plainly audible” means any sound that can be detected by a person using his or her unaided hearing faculties. As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, boom box or boom car, the detection of the rhythmic bass component of the music is sufficient to verify plainly audible sound. The sound control officer or police officer need not determine the title, specific words, or the artist performing the song and shall not require the use of a sound meter to determine plainly audible.
“Private right-of-way” means any street, avenue, boulevard, road, highway, sidewalk, alley or easement that is owned, leased, or controlled by a nongovernmental entity.
“Public right-of-way” means any street, avenue, boulevard, road, highway, sidewalk, alley or easement that is owned, leased, or controlled by a governmental entity.
“Public service facility” means any facility and its related premises, property or equipment used to provide governmental services to the public including, but not limited to:
    1. Maintenance centers;
    2. Offices and buildings of agencies or instrumentalities of government;
    3. Schools, parks, recreation centers;
    4. Waste collection centers;
    5. Waste recycling centers;
    6. Water and sewage facilities.
“Public space” means any real property or structures thereon that are owned, leased, or controlled by a governmental entity.
“Real property line” means either:
    1. The imaginary line, including its vertical extension that separates one parcel of real property from another;
    2. The vertical and horizontal boundaries of a dwelling unit that is part of a multi-dwelling unit building; or
    3. On a multi-use property, the interface between the two portions of the property on which different categories of activity are being performed (such as if the multi-use property is a building which is residential upstairs and commercial downstairs, then the real property line would be the interface between the residential area and the commercial area).
“Residential property” means property used for human habitation, including, but not limited to:
    1. Private property used for human habitation;
    2. Commercial living accommodations and commercial property used for human habitation;
    3. Recreational and entertainment property used for human habitation;
    4. Community service property used for human habitation;
    5. Hospitals or long-term care medical facilities.
Sound Control Administrator. The community development director or designee shall act as the sound control administrator, “SCA,” for the purposes of this chapter.
“Sound control officer” means a government employee who has received noise enforcement training and is currently certified in noise enforcement. The employee must be acting within his or her designated jurisdiction and must be authorized to issue a civil citation in order to be considered a sound control officer. The provisions of this code that do not require the use of a sound level meter may be enforced by any code enforcement or police officer.
“Sound level meter” means an instrument that conforms to ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors.
“Sound reproduction device” means any machine or device by which the human voice, music or any other sound is amplified. Sound reproduction device shall not include warning devices on any vehicle traveling to do emergency work or used for traffic safety purposes.
“Sound sensitive” means a facility whose operations may be detrimentally impacted by excessive sound levels. Such facilities include but are not limited to:
    1. Schools;
    2. Houses of worship;
    3. Outpatient medical facilities, hospitals, or nursing home;
    4. Library.
“Steady pure tone” means a sound for which the sound pressure is a simple sinusoidal function of the time and characterized by its singleness of pitch.
“Total sound level” means that measured level which represents the summation of the sounds from the sound source under investigation and the neighborhood residual sounds which affect a given place at a given time, exclusive of extraneous sound sources.
“Weekday” means Monday through Friday, inclusive.
“Weekends” means Saturday and Sunday. [Code 2006 § 9-4-2. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

8.25.030 Applicability.
This code applies to all sound sources within the city unless otherwise exempted. [Code 2006 § 9-4-3. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

8.25.040 Sound control administrator.
The sound control administrator shall have the power to:
A. Coordinate the noise control activities of all departments in the city and cooperate with all other public bodies and agencies to the extent practicable; and
B. Review the actions of the city and advise of the effect, if any, of such actions on noise control; and

E. Periodically review the provisions of this chapter and recommend revisions consistent with technology to reduce noise or to address new sound sources within the city. [Code 2006 § 9-4-4. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

8.25.050 Sound control officers.
The provisions of this section shall be enforced by sound control officers. A person shall be qualified to be a sound control officer if the person meets the criteria set forth in the definition in SCC 8.25.020 and completes, with a passing grade, a sound enforcement certification course and thereafter a recertification course every five years as offered by the Rutgers Noise Technical Assistance Center, Department of Environmental Science, the State University of New Jersey at Rutgers, or other similar noise enforcement certification course as approved by the administrator. The provisions of this code that do not require the use of a sound level meter may be enforced by any code enforcement officer, police officer or designated police department employee. Sound control officers shall have the power to:
A. Investigate and pursue possible violations of this chapter for sound levels which equal or exceed the sound levels set forth in Table I, when measured at a receiving property located within the designated jurisdiction of the sound control officer, in accordance with SCC 8.25.060;
B. Cooperate with sound control officers of adjacent jurisdictions in enforcing one another’s noise ordinances. [Code 2006 § 9-4-5. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

8.25.060 Maximum permissible sound levels.
A. Continuous Sound. 
    1. No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any source of sound on any source property listed in SCC 8.25.020 in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the sound level limits listed in Table I, as measured at any location at or within the property line of the receptor property. Sound pressure levels in excess of those established in Table I shall constitute prima facie evidence that such sound is in violation of this code.
    +---------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Residential and All Other | Residential and All Other | C1, C2, C3 Zone Districts |
    |           Zones           |           Zones           |         24 hours          |
    |  7:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m.   |  10:00 p.m. – 7:00 a.m.   |                           |

    +---------------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+
    2. These limits may not be exceeded by any single incident representing the normal, usual operation of the sound source, during any three sampling intervals, the duration of which shall be no less than one-half minute, within any one-hour period. If the total duration of the sound under investigation is less than one and one-half minutes, the requirement for three measurements shall be waived. For example, if a motor fan belt was to squeal for 20 seconds upon starting, but the sound was emitted with regularity from this source, a single measurement shall be sufficient.
    3. Nothing in this section supersedes the requirements of employers to comply with the Occupational Noise Exposure Standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 C.F.R. Part 1910.95). Compliance will help conserve workers’ hearing and reduce potential liability for the source.
B. Impulsive Sound. 
    1. Between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., impulsive sounds which occur less than 10 times in an hour shall not equal or exceed 20 decibels above the permissible sound level limits in Table I. Impulsive sound which repeats 10 or more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound level limits in Table I.
    2. Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., impulsive sounds which occur less than four times in an hour shall not equal or exceed 20 decibels above the permissible sound level limits in Table I. Impulsive sound which repeats four or more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound level limits in Table I.
C. Amplified Sound Reproduction Device. If the source of sound is an amplified sound reproduction device, and the complainant states that the rhythmic bass component of the music is disturbing within their residence, then the noise enforcement officer may take sound level measurements within the residence of the complainant. No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any amplified source of sound in such a manner that it raises the total sound levels above the permissible sound level limits set forth in Table II when measured within the residence of a complainant. These sound level measurements shall be conducted with the sound level meter set for “C” weighting, “fast” response. Such measurements shall not be taken in areas which receive only casual use such as hallways, closets and bathrooms. For the purposes of these measurements, the neighborhood residual sound level is that sound level which is measured in the residence when the sound source under investigation is not prominent, or in a room on the same floor that is relatively unaffected by the sound source under investigation. The C-scale is more sensitive to low frequency sound levels than the A-scale. An increase of three dB is perceived by humans as being perceptibly louder, while an increase of five dB is perceived as being plainly louder. At the lower bass frequencies of music an increase of six dB is perceived as a doubling of loudness.
+-------------------------+-----------------+
| 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. | All Other Times |
+-------------------------+-----------------+
| 3 dB(C)                 | 5 dB(C)         |
+-------------------------+-----------------+
D. Steady Pure Tones. If the sound source under investigation is a mechanical device, and is in the investigating officer’s opinion emitting a sound with a steady tonal quality, the permissible sound level limits in Table I shall be reduced by five dBA. The sound emissions must be comprised of a single frequency or a narrow cluster of frequencies, which may be referred to as a whine, hum, or buzz. The measured sound levels of such a source must not fluctuate by more than plus or minus three dB. Such sound sources include, but are not limited to: heating, ventilating or air-conditioning units; refrigeration units; transformers and pumps. [Code 2006 § 9-4-6. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

8.25.070 Procedures for the determination of sound levels.
A. The sound level shall be measured with a sound level meter. The sound level meter and calibrator must be recertified annually at a laboratory approved by the administrator. A field check of meter calibration and batteries must be conducted before and after every set of measurements and at least every hour as necessary.
B. Total and neighborhood residual sound level measurements shall be taken in accordance with procedures approved by the administrator. Calculation of source sound levels shall conform with accepted practice. [Code 2006 § 9-4-7. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

8.25.080 Inspections.
A. For the purpose of determining compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the administrator or his or her authorized representatives are hereby authorized to make inspections of all noise sources and to take sound level measurements and tests whenever necessary. If any person refuses or restricts entry and free access to any part of a premises, or refuses inspection, testing, or sound level measurement of any activity, device, facility, motor vehicle or process where inspection is sought, the administrator or their authorized representative may seek from a court of competent jurisdiction a warrant for inspection requiring that such person permit entry and free access without interference, restriction or obstruction (at a reasonable time) for the purpose of inspecting, testing, or measuring sound levels. The court shall have power, jurisdiction and authority to enforce all orders issued under the provisions of this chapter.

8.25.110 Enforcement.
A. This section governs the initiation of enforcement actions and the imposition of civil penalties for violations of this code.
B. If a person violates any provision of this code, or an order issued by the enforcement agency, the agency may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief to prohibit and prevent such violation or violations and the court may proceed in the action in a summary manner.
C. Any person who violates any provision of this code shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for each offense, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate and distinct offense.
D. The enforcement agency must determine whether the violation is a major or minor violation for the purposes of issuing an enforcement and compliance grace period. A violation is deemed to be minor if:
    1. The violation is not the result of purposeful, reckless or criminally negligent conduct of the violator; or
    2. The activity or condition constituting the violation has not been the subject of an enforcement action against the violator in the immediately preceding 12 months; and
    3. The violation is not the result of the operation of a sound reproduction or amplification device of any kind, with the exception of safety warning devices.
E. If the violation is deemed to be minor, the enforcement agency shall notify the violator that the activity or condition must be corrected and compliance achieved at the discretion of the enforcement agency, not to exceed 180 days, to be determined based upon the nature, extent and impact of the violation and a reasonable estimate of the time needed to correct the violation. The violator may request from the enforcement agency an extension of the compliance deadline and the enforcement agency may approve any reasonable request for an extension if the violator can demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made to achieve compliance. The sound control administrator shall offer special consideration, during the six-month period immediately following final enactment of this code, for preexisting sound sources which will require physical modifications to come into compliance.
F. If the violation is deemed to be minor, the enforcement agency shall notify the violator that if he or she achieves compliance within the period of time specified in the enforcement document, the enforcement agency shall not seek to collect a civil penalty from the violator for that violation.
G. If, during the grace period, the sound emissions for which the violation has been assessed increase in duration or intensity, the sound control administrator may revoke the grace period. In determining whether to revoke the grace period, the sound control administrator may consider the following factors: the relative increase in intensity; whether the change of sound emissions is directly related to ongoing sound abatement measures; and the anticipated duration of the increased sound levels.
H. If the violator does not correct a minor violation within the period of time specified in the enforcement document, the enforcement agency may seek injunctive relief and/or a penalty for a violation of this code. If the enforcement agency has reason to believe that the violator is not acting in good faith during the grace period, they may conduct further investigations during that period, and if the violator has not achieved compliance within the period of time specified in the enforcement document, the enforcement agency may prosecute any violations documented during the grace period.
I. If the violation is not deemed to be minor, it shall be deemed major and the enforcement agency shall notify the violator that he or she will not be allowed a period of time to correct the violation before a penalty is sought, and that he or she may be liable to a class 1 misdemeanor of no more than $2,500 for that violation and that the enforcement agency may seek summary injunctive relief.
J. Any claims for a civil penalty may be compromised and settled based upon the following factors:
    1. Mitigating or other extenuating circumstances;
    2. The timely implementation by the violator of measures which lead to compliance;
    3. The conduct of the violator; and
    4. The compliance history of the violator. [Code 2006 § 9-4-11. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

    4. A description of interim noise control measures to be taken by the applicant to minimize noise and the impacts occurring therefrom; and
    5. The name, address and means of contacting a responsible party during the hours of operation for which the temporary sound permit is issued.
C. In making the determination on granting a permit and in the sole discretion of the sound control administrator, the administrator may consider the following:
    1. The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, the health and welfare of the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened to be caused by the sound, to result from the temporary sound permit;
    2. The social and economic value of the activity for which the permit is sought;
    3. The ability of the applicant to apply best practical noise control measures.
D. The temporary sound permit shall enumerate the conditions of the permit, including:
    1. Specific dates, times, duration, and distances for which the permit is valid;
    2. Sound level limits which may not be exceeded at the nearest affected residential property; or
    3. Any other such conditions that may mitigate any adverse impact upon the parties, as determined by the sound control administrator.
E. The temporary sound permit may be revoked by the sound control administrator, if terms of the permit are violated.
F. A permit may be revoked by the sound control administrator, and the issuance of future permits withheld, if there is:
    1. Violation of one or more conditions of the permit;
    2. Material misrepresentation of fact in the permit application; or
    3. Material change in any of the circumstances relied upon by the sound control administrator in granting the permit. [Code 2006 § 9-4-12. Ord. 2018-03 § 1, 2-13-2018; Res. 2018-04 Exh. A, 2-13-2018].

8.25.130 Severability.
If any provision or portion of a provision of this chapter is held to be unconstitutional, preempted by federal or state law, or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the ordinance shall not be invalidated.

8.45.010 Body art – Findings and purpose.
This chapter is based on the following findings and purposes:
A. Body art is becoming prevalent and popular in the city.
B. Injuries, infections and occasional transmission of diseases such as hepatitis, HIV, or other communicable diseases are occurring as a result of improper body art or aftercare procedures.
C. The general law as found in A.R.S. Section 13-3721 makes certain body art practices unlawful but does not regulate or license body art establishments, and there are no state regulations governing body art licensing or sanitation practices. The city is committed to requiring a license for a body art establishment and body art operators as the most effective means of administering and regulating a public health program with sanitation standards, training requirements, and client education and disclosure.
D. It is the mission of the city to prevent disease and to provide a healthful environment for all citizens of the city. This chapter is therefore directed to the licensing and enforcement of body art regulations. [Code 2006 § 9-5-1. Ord. 2003-01, 1-14-2003].

The charge shall set forth the facts upon which it is based, shall identify the person charged (hereinafter the “respondent”), and shall be signed by the complainant.
B. The CMO shall furnish the respondent with a copy of the charge via first class United States mail. The respondent may file, not later than 30 days following the CMO’s mailing of the charge to the respondent, a written verified answer to the charge.
C. Within 30 days following receipt of the charge from the complainant, the CMO shall conduct an initial screening of the charge to determine whether the city has jurisdiction over the charge, whether the charge was timely filed, and whether the allegations, if true, would constitute a violation of this chapter.
D. If the CMO determines, based on a review of the charge, that the city does not have jurisdiction, that the charge is untimely, or that the allegations would be insufficient to show a violation of this chapter, the CMO shall dismiss the charge. The decision of the CMO to dismiss the charge, after conducting the initial screening, is final. The CMO shall provide the complainant, the respondent, and the city attorney with written findings concerning the CMO’s determination to dismiss the charge and the charge will be considered closed.
E. If the CMO issues an initial determination that the city has jurisdiction over the charge, the charge was timely filed, and the allegations, if true, would constitute a violation of this chapter, the CMO shall refer the matter to a mediator.
F. The mediator shall review the matter. The mediator shall attempt to assist the complainant and respondent in reaching settlement of the charge in a cooperative manner using restorative justice principles, mediation, conference, conciliation, and persuasion. If the mediator deems that such an attempt is not practicable, the mediator shall refer the matter to an investigator. The investigator shall follow the process described in subsection (I) of this section.
G. If the mediation is successful, the mediator shall facilitate the drafting of an agreement with the complainant and the respondent for the purpose of eliminating the alleged discriminatory practice. The terms of the agreement may require the respondent to refrain in the future from committing discriminatory practices of the type stated in the agreement and to take such affirmative steps as the mediator may require to carry out the purposes of this chapter. If an agreement is entered into, the mediator shall furnish copies to the CMO, the city attorney, the complainant, and the respondent at which time the charge will be considered closed.
H. To the extent permitted by law, except for the terms of the agreement, neither the mediator nor the city manager, nor any employee thereof, shall make public, without the written consent of the complainant and respondent, information concerning efforts in a particular case to eliminate a discriminatory practice through mediation or by conference, conciliation, or persuasion, whether or not there is an agreement. In addition, as stated under Rule 408 of the Arizona Rules of Evidence, such information may not be used as evidence in any judicial proceeding.
I. If the mediator, the complainant, and the respondent cannot reach an agreement, the mediator shall refer the matter to an investigator, who shall attempt to determine the facts relevant to the charge filed under this chapter. The investigator shall, pursuant to administrative policy direction provided by the city manager, conduct an investigation of the charge to determine whether the facts support a finding that a violation of this chapter has occurred. If the investigator determines that a violation of this chapter did not occur, the complainant’s charge will be dismissed, and the matter will be considered closed. If the investigator determines that a violation of this chapter did occur, the investigator shall refer the matter to the city attorney for a determination of whether to file a complaint against the respondent in the Sedona magistrate court.
J. The city attorney’s office will determine whether sufficient facts and evidence exist in order to warrant the initiation of an action in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the city attorney’s office determines that the facts or evidence are insufficient to warrant the initiation of an action, the city attorney will provide written notification to the parties, and the charge will be dismissed. Charges may be dismissed for reasons including: the complaint was untimely filed, the location of the alleged practice was outside of the city’s jurisdiction, insufficient evidence exists to conclude that the violation occurred, or a conciliation agreement has been executed by the parties.
K. In situations involving repeat offenses, the CMO shall immediately refer the matter to an investigator, who shall follow the process described in subsection (I) of this section. If, at the conclusion of the investigation process, the city attorney does not file a complaint in court then the city attorney may refer the charge back to the mediator. The mediator, in his or her discretion, may attempt to assist in resolution of the charge or may close the matter. [Ord. 2015-10 § 1, 9-8-2015; Res. 2015-24 Exh. A, 9-8-2015].

13.50.010 Finding of fact.
Illicit discharges occur due to illicit connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system (“MS4”) from residential, business, industrial or commercial establishments. As a result of illicit connections, contaminated storm water, wastes or wastewater enters into storm drains or directly into local waters without receiving treatment from a wastewater treatment plant. Illicit connections may be intentional or may be unknown to the property or business owner. Illicit discharges to the city storm water system can cause excessive discharges of pollutants to surface waters and groundwater. These discharges can negatively impact public health, welfare, and the environment by transporting and depositing pollutants. [Code 2006 § 14-1-1. Ord. 2007-17, 11-13-2007; Ord. 2014-06 § 1, 5-27-2014; Res. 2014-10 Exh. A, 5-27-2014].

13.50.020 Purpose and intent.
A. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for health, safety, and general welfare within the city through the regulation of non-storm water discharges to the MS4 to the maximum extent practicable (“MEP”) as required by federal and state law. To this end this chapter requires that unless expressly authorized or exempted by this chapter, no person shall cause, participate in, or allow the discharge to a public right-of-way or public storm drain system of any substance that is not composed entirely of storm water. To further this end, this chapter establishes authority to conduct and require inspection, monitoring, reporting, and enforcement activities to address the prevention, identification, and remediation of illicit discharges to the MS4.
B. It is the intent of this chapter to comply with AZPDES regulations for storm water discharges, to be consistent with the storm water quality provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1342), and to enable the city to comply with all applicable storm water quality provisions of federal, state, and local laws and regulations to ensure the future health, safety, and general welfare within the city, as well as the protection and preservation of the local environment.
C. It is the intent of this chapter that the standards promulgated by this chapter are minimum standards; therefore, it is not intended or implied that compliance with the provisions of this chapter by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants. [Code 2006 § 14-1-2. Ord. 2007-17, 11-13-2007; Ord. 2014-06 § 1, 5-27-2014; Res. 2014-10 Exh. A, 5-27-2014].

    2. If violator refuses or is unable to immediately abate a condition that presents an immediate threat to public health, safety or the environment, the city may use all means necessary to abate the incident to protect the public health, safety or the environment and the city may charge all costs of such abatement to the violator.
    3. The city may approve the compliance schedule or corrective action plan utilizing best management practices submitted by the violator, or may require an alternative compliance schedule or corrective action plan utilizing best management practices. This shall be done within the period specified in the notice. If the city discovers a condition that is likely to cause or is causing a discharge that threatens public health, safety or the environment, mitigation may include an immediate cessation of activity and abatement.
    4. The remedies in this section are cumulative and the city may seek one or more such remedies.
    5. It is a civil infraction for any person to violate this section or fail to comply with a notice of violation issued under this section.

    2. The city engineer may, within 10 working days of the receipt of an appeal, provide a written response to the person appealing which shall be delivered either by mail or by personal delivery. No response within 10 working days shall be deemed to be a denial of the appeal.
    3. Appeal of the city engineer response or lack thereof to the notice of appeal shall be in accordance with Chapter 3.10 SCC if the claim is monetary in nature. The cause of action shall be deemed the notice of violation.
    4. If the claim or demand is other than solely monetary in nature, appeal of the city engineer response or lack thereof shall be made to the city manager. Notice of such appeal shall be mailed to the city attorney who shall schedule a hearing to be conducted by the city manager, who shall admit all probative and reliable evidence without regard to formal rules of evidence or procedure. The person requesting an appeal may be heard in person and/or by an authorized representative at such hearing.

    5. Appeal of the city manager decision may be made in a court of competent jurisdiction.
C. Cost of Abatement of the Violation. Within 30 calendar days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 15 calendar days. If the amount due is not paid within 15 calendar days or by the time in which to file for an appeal is expired, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. The assessment shall be recorded in the office of the Yavapai County recorder or Coconino County recorder, including the date, amount of the assessment, and the legal description of the property against which the assessment is made. From the date of its recording, the assessment shall be a lien on the property and shall accrue interest at the rate prescribed by A.R.S. Section 44-1201. The city shall have the right to bring an action to enforce the lien in the superior court of Yavapai County at any time after the recording of the assessment, but failure to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its validity. The recorded assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited therein, and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the recording of the assessment.
D. Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provisions or to fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or continues to violate any provisions of this chapter, the city may petition the Yavapai County superior court for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
E. Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided herein, if any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance by the city, such condition may be immediately abated or restored at the violator’s expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. Nuisances under this chapter are also subject to enforcement under Chapter 8.10 SCC, Article I.
F. Remedies Not Exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the city to seek cumulative remedies. The city may recover all attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses. [Code 2006 § 14-1-15.

The actual impact fees to be assessed shall be disclosed and adopted in the form of impact fee schedules described in Appendix A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter.
C. Carry-Over of Previously Established Development Impact Fees. The city may continue to use any development impact fees previously collected, even if the development impact fee would not otherwise be permitted to be collected and spent pursuant to A.R.S. Section 9-463.05, as amended by the state legislature in SB 1525, Fiftieth Legislature, First Regular Session. Use of previously collected fees shall be governed by the provisions of A.R.S. Section 9-463.05(K) as well as any other relevant provisions of this statute or amendments thereto. [Ord. 2014-04 § 1, 5-22-2014; Res. 2014-09 Exh. A, 5-22-2014].
* Editor’s note: Per SCC 2.25.100, the city clerk has noted a clerical/typographical drafting error and will be recommending in a future report to the city council that said sentence should read: “No development impact fees shall be charged, or credits issued, for any capital facility that does not fall within one of the categories of necessary public services for which development impact fees may be assessed.”

B. Adopting or Amending the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. The infrastructure improvements plan shall be adopted or amended subject to the following procedures:
    1. Major Amendments to the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. Except as provided in subsection (B)(2) of this section, the adoption or amendment of an infrastructure improvement plan shall occur at one or more public hearings according to the following schedule, and may occur concurrently with the adoption of an update of the city’s land use assumptions:
        a. Sixty days before the first public hearing regarding a new or updated infrastructure improvements plan, the city shall provide public notice of the hearing and post the infrastructure improvements plan and the underlying land use assumptions on its website; the city shall additionally make available to the public the documents used to prepare the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions and the amount of any proposed changes to the development fees per service unit.
        b. The city shall conduct a public hearing on the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions at least 30 days, but no more than 60 days, before approving or disapproving the infrastructure improvements plan.
    2. Minor Amendments to the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, the city may update the infrastructure improvements plan and/or its underlying land use assumptions without a public hearing if all of the following apply:
        a. The changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions will not add any new category of necessary public services to any service area.

        c. Based on an analysis of the fee report and the city’s adopted development impact fee schedules, the changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions would not, individually or cumulatively with other amendments undertaken pursuant to this subsection, have caused a development impact fee in any service area to have been increased by more than five percent above the development impact fee that is provided in the current development impact fee schedule.
        d. At least 30 days prior to the date that any amendment pursuant to this section is adopted, the city shall post the proposed amendments on the city website.
C. Amendments to the Fee Report. Any adoption or amendment of a fee report and fee schedule shall occur at one or more public hearings according to the following schedule:

The city must give at least 30 days’ notice prior to the hearing; provided, that this notice may be given on the same day as the approval or disapproval of the infrastructure improvements plan.
    2. The city shall make the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions available to the public on the city’s website 30 days prior to the public hearing described in subsection (C)(1) of this section.
    3. The fee report may be adopted by the city no sooner than 30 days, and no later than 60 days, after the hearing described in subsection (C)(1) of this section.
    4. The development fee schedules in the fee report adopted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective 75 days after adoption of the fee report by the city. [Ord. 2014-04 § 1, 5-22-2014; Res. 2014-09 Exh. A, 5-22-2014].

14.05.080 Timing for the renewal and updating of the infrastructure improvements plan and the land use assumptions.
A. Renewing the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. Except as provided in subsection (B) of this section, not later than every five years the city shall update the applicable infrastructure improvements plan and fee report related to each category of necessary public services pursuant to SCC 14.05.070. Such five-year period shall be calculated from the date of the adoption of the infrastructure improvements plan or the date of the adoption of the fee report, whichever occurs later.
B. Determination of No Changes. Notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, if the city determines that no changes to an infrastructure improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, or fee report are needed, the city may elect to continue the existing infrastructure improvements plan and fee report without amendment by providing notice as follows:
    1. Notice of the determination shall be published at least 180 days prior to the end of the five-year period described in subsection (A) of this section.
    2. The notice shall identify the infrastructure improvements plan and fee report that shall continue in force without amendment.
    3. The notice shall provide a map and description of the service area(s) covered by such infrastructure improvements plan and fee report.
    4. The notice shall identify an address to which any resident of the city may submit, within 60 days, a written request that the city update the infrastructure improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, and/or fee report and the reasons and basis for the request.
C. Response to Comments. The city shall consider and respond within 30 days to any timely requests submitted pursuant to subsection (B)(4) of this section. [Ord. 2014-04 § 1, 5-22-2014; Res. 2014-09 Exh. A, 5-22-2014].

14.05.090 Collection of development impact fees.
A. Collection. Development impact fees, together with administrative charges assessed pursuant to subsection (A)(5) of this section, shall be calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence development; specifically: 
    1. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement adopted pursuant to SCC 14.05.110, development impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit according to the current development impact fee schedule. In addition, the city manager is authorized to enter into a short-term financing agreement with a developer wherein impact fees may be paid over time, but must be paid in full before issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
    2. If the development is located in a service area with a storm drainage development impact fee, a building permit is not required; the storm drainage development impact fee due shall be paid at the time a civil or site permit is issued for the development.
    3. No building permit, sewer connection, or certificate of occupancy shall be issued if a development impact fee is not paid as directed in the previous subsections.
    4. If the building permit is for a change in the type of building use, an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a residential or nonresidential point of demand to the wastewater system, the development impact fee shall be assessed on the additional service units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development impact fee schedule applicable to any new use type.
    5. For issued permits that expire or are voided, development impact fees and administrative charges shall be as follows:
        a. If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or voided permit, and the development impact fees paid for such development have not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any development impact fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed.
        b. If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit applicant shall pay the full development impact fees specified in the fee schedule in effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit applicant, the new permit applicant shall pay development impact fees as if it were the original permittee.
B. Exceptions. Development impact fees shall not be owed under either of the following conditions:
    1. Development impact fees have been paid for the development and the permit(s) which triggered the collection of the development impact fees have not expired or been voided.
    2. The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development impact fees involve modifications to existing residential or nonresidential development that do not: (a) add new service units, (b) increase the impact of existing service units on existing or future capital facilities, or (c) change the land-use type of the existing development to a different category of development for which a higher development impact fee would have been due. To the extent that any modification does not meet the requirements of this subsection, the development impact fee due shall be the difference between the development impact fee that was or would have been due on the existing development and the development impact fee that is due on the development as modified.
C. Temporary Exemptions from Development Impact Fee Schedules. New developments in the city shall be temporarily exempt from increases in development impact fees that result from the adoption of new or modified development impact fee schedules as follows:
    1. Residential Uses. On or after the day that the first building permit is issued for a single-family residential development, the city shall, at the permittee’s request, provide the permittee with an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the twenty-fifth month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same single-family residential development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee schedule.
    2. Commercial, Industrial and Multifamily Uses. On or after the day that the final approval, as defined in A.R.S. Section 9-463.05(T)(4), is issued for a commercial, industrial or multifamily development, the city shall provide an applicable development impact fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that final development approval of a site plan or final subdivision plat is given, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the twenty-fifth month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development impact fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same development shall not be subject to any new or modified development impact fee schedule.
    3. Other Development. Any category of development not covered under subsections (C)(1) and (2) of this section shall pay development impact fees according to the fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as specified in subsection (A) of this section. 
    4. Changes to Site Plans and Subdivision Plats. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subsection, if changes are made to a development’s final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service units after the issuance of a grandfathered development impact fee schedule, the city may assess any new or modified development impact fees against the additional service units. If the city reduces the amount of an applicable development impact fee during the period that a grandfathered development impact fee schedule is in force, the city shall assess the lower development impact fee.
D. Option to Pursue Special Fee Determination. Where a development is of a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development appearing on an adopted development impact fee schedule, or where a development has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated with providing necessary public services to that development will differ substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified category of development, the city may require the applicant to provide the city community and economic development director or authorized designee with an alternative development impact fee analysis. Based on a projection of the actual burdens and costs that will be associated with the development, the alternative development impact fee analysis may propose a unique fee for the development or may propose that the development be covered under the development impact fee schedule governing a different and more analogous category of development. The city community and economic development director or authorized designee shall review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall make a determination as to the development impact fee to be charged. Such decision shall be appealable pursuant to SCC 14.05.120. The city community and economic development director or authorized designee may require the applicant to pay an administrative fee to cover the actual costs of reviewing the special fee determination application. [Ord. 2014-04 § 1, 5-22-2014; Res. 2014-09 Exh. A, 5-22-2014].

14.05.100 Development impact fee credits and credit agreements.
A. Eligibility of Capital Facility. All development impact fee credits must meet the following requirements:
    1. One of the following is true:
        a. The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward a capital facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit will be issued, must be identified in an adopted infrastructure improvements plan and fee report as a capital facility for which a development impact fee was assessed; or
        b. The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility should have been included in the infrastructure improvements plan in lieu of a different capital facility that was included in the infrastructure improvements plan and for which a development impact fee was assessed. If the subject capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the city shall amend the infrastructure improvements plan to (i) include the subject replacement facility and (ii) delete the capital facility that will be replaced.
    2. Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by the city through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the developer will be paid or reimbursed by the city for any contribution, payment, construction, or dedication from any city funding source including an agreement to reimburse the developer with future collected development impact fees, any credits claimed by the developer shall be: (a) deducted from any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the city; or (b) reduced by the amount of such payment or reimbursement.
B. Eligibility of Subject Development. To be eligible for a credit, the subject development must be located within the service area of the eligible capital facility.
C. Calculation of Credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted infrastructure improvements plan for which a development fee was assessed pursuant to the fee report. A credit shall not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in providing the eligible capital facility. 
D. Allocation of Credits. Before any credit can be issued to a subject development (or portion thereof), the credit must be allocated to that development by executing a credit agreement between the developer and the city stating the total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an eligible capital facility.
    1. It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of development impact fee credits by requesting a credit agreement (which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to SCC 14.05.110).
    2. If a building permit is issued or a sewer connection is purchased, and a development impact fee is paid prior to execution of a credit agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this chapter.
    3. If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior to execution of a credit agreement or development agreement, credits resulting from the eligible capital facility will only be allocated to the development if the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor(s) in interest for the subject development.
    4. If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible capital facility, both entities must enter into a single credit agreement with the city, and any request for the allocation of credit within the subject development(s) must be made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible capital facility.
E. Credit Agreement. Credits shall only be issued pursuant to a credit agreement executed in accordance with subsection (D) of this section. The city manager or authorized designee is authorized by this chapter to enter into a credit agreement with the controlling entity of a subject development, subject to the following:
    1. The developer requesting the credit agreement shall provide all information requested by the city to allow it to determine the value of the credit to be applied.
    2. An application for a credit agreement shall be submitted to the city by the developer within one year of the date on which ownership or control of the capital facility passes to the city.
    3. The developer shall submit a draft credit agreement to the city manager or authorized designee(s) for review. The draft credit agreement shall include, at a minimum, all of the following information and supporting documentation:
        a. A legal description and map depicting the location of the subject development for which credit is being applied. The map shall depict the location of the capital facilities that have been or will be provided.
        b. An estimate of the total service units that will be developed within the subject development depicted on the map and described in the legal description.
        c. A list of the capital facilities, associated physical attributes, and the related costs as stated in the infrastructure improvements plan.
        d. Documentation showing the date(s) of acceptance by the city, if the capital facilities have already been provided.
        e. The total amount of credit to be applied within the subject development and the calculations leading to the total amount of credit.
        f. The credit amount to be applied to each service unit within the subject development for each category of necessary public services.
    4. The city’s determination of the credit to be allocated is final.
    5. Upon execution of the credit agreement by the city and the applicant, credits shall be deemed allocated to the subject development.
    6. Any amendment to a previously approved credit agreement must be initiated within two years of the city’s final acceptance of the eligible capital facility for which the amendment is requested.
    7. Any credit agreement approved as part of a development agreement shall be amended in accordance with the terms of the development agreement and SCC 14.05.110.
F. Issuance of Credits. Credits allocated pursuant to subsection (D) of this section may be issued and applied toward the gross impact fees due from a development, subject to the following conditions:
    1. Credits issued for an eligible capital facility may only be applied to the development impact fee due for the applicable category of necessary public services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another category of necessary public services.
    2. Credits shall only be issued when the eligible capital facility from which the credits were derived has been accepted by the city or when adequate security for the completion of the eligible capital facility has been provided in accordance with all terms of an executed development agreement.
    3. Where credits have been issued pursuant to subsection (F)(2) of this section, an impact fee due at the time a building permit is issued shall be reduced by the credit amount stated in or calculated from the executed credit agreement. Where credits have not yet been issued, the gross impact fee shall be paid in full, and a refund of the credit amount shall be due when the developer demonstrates compliance with subsection (F)(2) of this section in a written request to the city.
    4. Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to another permit or parcel, except that credits may be released for reuse on the same subject development if a building permit for which the credits were issued has expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a refund under SCC 14.05.130(A)(2)(a).
    5. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, credits issued prior to January 1, 2012, may only be used for the subject development for which they were issued. Such credits may be transferred to a new owner of all or part of the subject development in proportion to the percentage of ownership in the subject development to be held by the new owner. [Ord. 2014-04 § 1, 5-22-2014; Res. 2014-09 Exh. A, 5-22-2014].

A. Development Agreement Required. A development agreement is required to authorize any of the following:
    1. To issue credits prior to the city’s acceptance of an eligible capital facility.
    2. To reimburse the developer of an eligible capital facility using funds from development impact fee accounts.
    3. To allocate different credit amounts per service unit to different parcels within a subject development.
    4. For a single-family residential dwelling unit, to allow development impact fees to be paid at a later time than the issuance of a building permit as provided in this section.
B. General Requirements. All development agreements shall be prepared and executed in accordance with A.R.S. Section 9-500.05 and any applicable requirements of the city code. Except where specifically modified by this section, all provisions of this section shall apply to any credit agreement that is authorized as part of a development agreement.
C. Early Credit Issuance. A development agreement may authorize the issuance of credits prior to acceptance of an eligible capital facility by the city when the development agreement specifically states the form and value of the security (i.e., bond, letter of credit, etc.) to be provided to the city prior to issuance of any credits. The city shall determine the acceptable form and value of the security to be provided.
D. Noncontiguous Credit Allocation. A development agreement may authorize the allocation of credits to a noncontiguous parcel only if all of the following conditions are met:
    1. The noncontiguous parcel is in the same service area as that served by the eligible capital facility.
    2. The noncontiguous parcel receives a necessary public service from the eligible capital facility.
    3. The development agreement specifically states the value of the credits to be allocated to each parcel and/or service unit, or establishes a mechanism for future determination of the credit values.
E. Uneven Credit Allocation. The development agreement must specify how credits will be allocated amongst different parcels, if the credits are not to be allocated evenly. If the development agreement is silent on this topic, all credits will be allocated evenly amongst all parcels.
F. Use of Reimbursements. Funds reimbursed to developers from impact fee accounts for construction of an eligible capital facility must be utilized in accordance with applicable law for the use of city funds in construction or acquisition of capital facilities, including A.R.S. Section 34-201 et seq.
G. Deferral of Fees. A development agreement may provide for the deferral of payment of development impact fees for a residential development beyond the issuance of a building permit; provided, that a development impact fee may not be paid later than the 15 days after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for that dwelling unit. The development agreement shall provide for the value of any deferred development impact fees to be supported by appropriate security, including a surety bond, letter of credit, or cash bond.
H. Waiver of Fees. If the city agrees to waive any development impact fees assessed on development in a development agreement, the city shall reimburse the appropriate development impact fee account for the amount that was waived.
I. No Obligation. Nothing in this section obligates the city to enter into any development agreement or to authorize any type of credit agreement permitted by this section. [Ord. 2014-04 § 1, 5-22-2014; Res. 2014-09 Exh. A, 5-22-2014].

14.05.120 Appeals.
A development impact fee determination by city staff may be appealed in accordance with the following procedures:
A. Limited Scope. An appeal shall be limited to disputes regarding the calculation of the development impact fees for a specific development and/or permit for the development.
B. Form of Appeal. An appeal shall be initiated on such written form as the city may prescribe, and submitted to the director of the community and economic development department.

If the applicant fails to deliver the full amount of the impact fees when required by this subsection, the city may draw upon such financial assurance instrument(s) as necessary to recover the full amount of the impact fees due from the applicant. [Ord. 2014-04 § 1, 5-22-2014; Res. 2014-09 Exh. A, 5-22-2014].

14.05.130 Refunds of development impact fees.
A. Refunds. A refund (or partial refund) will be paid to any current owner of property within the city who submits a written request to the city and demonstrates that:
    1. The permit(s) that triggered the collection of the development impact fee have expired or been voided prior to the commencement of the development for which the permits were issued and the development impact fees collected have not been expended, encumbered, or pledged for the repayment of financing or debt; or
    2. The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in interest paid a development impact fee for the applicable capital facility on or after August 5, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists:
        a. After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility the city fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time period identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, as it may be amended, and the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject real property from that capital facility or any other infrastructure.
        b. For a category of necessary public services any part of a development impact fee is not spent within 10 years of the city’s receipt of the development impact fee.
        c. The development impact fee was calculated and collected for the construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital facility serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the infrastructure improvements plan by a factor of 10 percent or more. In such event, the current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request as set forth in this subsection (A), be entitled to a refund for the difference between the amounts of the development impact fee charged for and attributable to such construction cost and the amount the development impact fee would have been calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the fee report. The refund contemplated by this subsection shall relate only to the costs specific to the construction of the applicable capital facility and shall not include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly incurred for construction of the capital facility that are included in the development impact fee as permitted by A.R.S.

14.10.010 Purpose.
The city is concerned with the traffic operation and safety aspects of the movement of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic from and to streets and highways within the city limits. This concern is demonstrated in the right-of-way permit process, Chapter 12.05 SCC, where care is taken to assure that a proposed right-of-way is managed to minimize any significant negative impacts to the existing and permitted rights-of-way, including streets and highways within the city. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a uniform policy for conducting a traffic impact study where the anticipated traffic behavior resulting from a development is expected to have a materially negative operational or safety impact on a street or highway within the city. [Code 2006 § 7-17-1. Ord. 2008-05, 6-10-2008].

14.10.020 Scope.
This chapter shall apply to proposed developments on all lands within the city. [Code 2006 § 7-17-2].

14.10.030 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
“Traffic generator” means a designated land use or building type which, when in use or operation, generates a flow of motor vehicle, bicycle or pedestrian traffic.
“Traffic impact study” means a traffic engineering study of the potential negative impact on traffic operations and safety resulting from a proposed traffic generator and shall include any recommended street or highway improvements to mitigate such negative impact, and the means proposed for the timing, funding and construction of these improvements. [Code 2006 § 7-17-3. Ord. 2008-05, 6-10-2008].

14.10.050 Procedure.
A. As part of the development review process, a traffic impact study shall be submitted by the developer for a residential development with 10 or more dwelling units.
B. As part of the development review process, a traffic impact study shall be submitted by the developer for any nonresidential development where 100 or more trips are expected to be generated by the development during either the peak traffic hours of the development, or during the peak traffic hours of the city as specified in writing by the city engineer.
C. For any development other than those set forth in subsections (A) and (B) of this section, a traffic impact study shall be submitted by the developer as part of the development review and right-of-way permit process where new street or highway access or access adjustments are requested by the developer, or where the proposed access to the state highway is within 250 feet of another access or intersection or where the proposed development will constitute a significant change in land use adjacent to existing points of access. This is to determine if the change in access or of land use will be expected to have a materially negative impact on traffic operations or traffic safety or it the number of access points along the state highway can be reduced.
D. When the traffic impact study indicates that the development will probably have a materially negative impact on traffic operations or traffic safety, the developer shall analyze and report on all transportation improvements that will be necessary to maintain the existing levels of traffic operation and safety. The analysis shall recommend specific timing, funding and construction means that will enable the developer to properly implement the recommended improvements. For phased projects, the traffic impact study shall specify the means by which the developer will mitigate the traffic impacts as each phase of the project is constructed.
E. The study shall examine the feasibility and impact of reducing points to the state roadways by utilizing city streets or by more than one property using a highway access point. [Code 2006 § 7-17-5. Ord. 2008-05, 6-10-2008].

14.10.060 Study requirements.
The traffic impact study shall incorporate graphics, such as drawings and maps, and shall consider and include, but shall not be limited to, the following features:
A. Physical Roadway Features. 
    1. General description of location.
    2. Type of existing roadway.
    3. Existing roadway geometrics.

[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

1.3. Authority, Applicability, and Jurisdiction

A. Authority
This Code is enacted pursuant to the requirements and authority granted the City by the Arizona Constitution, Article XIII, Section I and A.R.S. §§ 9-276, 9-461, 9-462 and 9-463.

B. General Applicability
This Code shall apply to all land, buildings, structures, and uses thereof located within the City of Sedona, as those terms are defined in Article 9: Rules of Construction and Definitions, unless an express exemption is granted within this Code.

C. Compliance Required
(1) No permit, certificate, or approval of any use that is subject to this Code shall be issued or granted by any department, agency, City official, or City employee without a finding of compliance with this Code having been issued by the appropriate review authority.
(2) Unless otherwise stated in this Code, no building or structure shall be erected, moved, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, or altered, nor shall any land or building be used, developed, or intended to be used for any purpose whatsoever, without a determination by the Director of substantial compliance with this Code.
(3) No lot of record that did not exist on the effective date of this Code shall be created by subdivision or otherwise unless it complies with this Code.

If any section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this Code or the application of it to any person or place is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid under Arizona law, unconstitutional under the Arizona or United States Constitutions, or inapplicable in any way to the City, for any reason, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Code or its application to other persons and places. The City Council hereby expressly declares that it would have adopted this Code and each section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase or portion irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases may be declared invalid or unconstitutional.

E. Adoption of Zoning Map
The official “City of Sedona Zoning Map,” and any amendments together with all notations, data, references and other information, is adopted concurrently herewith and not included in this Code. It applies each zoning district to parcels within the City.

E. Conflict with Agreements Between Private Parties
This Code is not intended to revoke or repeal any easement, covenant, or other agreements between private parties. However, where the regulations of this Code are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easement, covenant, or other agreements between private parties, then the requirements of this Code shall govern in accordance with applicable Arizona law. Nothing in this Code shall modify or repeal any private covenant or deed restriction, but such covenant or restriction shall not excuse any failure to comply with this Code. In no case shall the City be obligated to enforce the provisions of any easements, covenants, or agreements between private parties, unless the City is a party to such agreements and only if the City decides, in its discretion, to pursue enforcement action.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

1.6. Nonconformities

A. Purpose
The purpose of this Section 1.6 is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of uses, structures, lots, signs, and site features such as parking and landscaping, that were lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Code, but that no longer conform to the requirements of this Code. All such situations are collectively referred to in this section as “nonconformities.” While nonconformities may continue, the provisions of this section are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities to bring about their eventual elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this Code and the goals of the City.

B. Regulations Applicable to All Nonconformities
(1) Authority to Continue

    b. Nonconformities shall not be modified in any way that increases the degree of nonconformity.
(2) Determination of Nonconformity Status
The burden of establishing the existence of a nonconformity shall be solely on the owner of the property containing the nonconformity.
(3) Maintenance and Minor Repair
Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconformities are permitted and encouraged; provided, that the repairs and maintenance do not increase the degree of nonconformity. Minor repairs and maintenance include the following:
    a. Repairs necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness of, or the exterior or interior appearance of, a building or structure without expanding the height or footprint of the building or structure, unless compliant with this Code;
    b. Maintenance of land to protect against and mitigate health and environmental hazards;
    c. Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions; and
    d. Repairs necessary to comply with current building code requirements.
(4) Change of Ownership or Tenancy
Changes in ownership, tenancy, or management of property with an existing nonconformity may occur, but such nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the standards of this Section 1.6, Nonconformities.
(5) Compliance to the Maximum Extent Practicable
Where compliance with the requirements of this section is precluded by a lack of sufficient developable area due to the size of the lot, the layout of existing development, or the presence of significant wetlands, floodplains, watercourses, hazard areas, or other significant environmental constraints, the applicant shall comply with the requirements of this section to the maximum extent practicable, as determined by the Director.

C. Nonconforming Uses
Nonconforming uses of land, buildings, or structures are subject to the following additional limitations:
(1) Limitations on Continuation of Nonconforming Uses
    a. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout the same building or structure; provided, that:
        1. No structural alteration of the building (or portion of such building containing the nonconforming use in the case of buildings with multiple uses) shall be permitted;
        2. No additional dwelling units shall be permitted in the building;
        3. No additional nonresidential units and/or uses shall be permitted; and
        4. Such extension would not result in additional required parking pursuant to Section 5.5.D, Minimum Off-Street Parking Spaces Required.
    b. Any existing occupied single-family residential dwelling that is deemed to be a nonconforming use may make improvements to the main and accessory structures so long as improvements do not increase the degree of nonconformity or increase the height or building footprint.
    c. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Code shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land or structure.
    d. Whenever a nonconforming use of land or a building has been discontinued for a period of six months, future use of land or building shall comply with this Code. The Director may grant an extension if improvements that are necessary for the continuation of the nonconforming use are diligently pursued.
(2) Change of Use
    a. A nonconforming use that has been changed to a less nonconforming use pursuant to this subsection may not subsequently be changed back to a more nonconforming use.
    b. A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not subsequently be changed back to any nonconforming use unless otherwise permitted by this Code.

D. Nonconforming Structures
Nonconforming structures are subject to the following additional limitations:
(1) A nonconforming structure may only be expanded pursuant to Section 1.6.B(3), Maintenance and Minor Repair, and any such expansion shall be in full compliance with this Code.
(2) No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases the nonconformity of the structure, but any structure or portion of a structure may be altered to maintain or decrease the nonconformity of the structure.
(3) A nonconforming structure that has been damaged or destroyed by fire or other causes may be restored to its original condition; provided, that such work is commenced within one year of such event and has been completed or diligently pursued within 18 months of such event. By written request from the property owner stating reasons for the delay, the Director may grant one extension of either the work commencement and/or the completion of work time period.
(4) Enlargements, alterations, and repairs to nonconforming structures that would otherwise be permitted by this Code and that would result in an increase to the flood damage potential shall require floodproofing or shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood elevation. For nonconforming residential structures, such structures shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood elevation and floodproofing shall not be an option to comply with these standards.

E. Nonconforming Lots
Nonconforming lots are subject to the following additional limitations:
(1) A nonconforming lot that was made nonconforming by virtue of enactment of this Code may be used for construction of a building allowed in the applicable zoning district; provided, that all other zoning district and dimensional standards are met.
(2) In any district where single-family dwellings are permitted, the setback requirements applicable in the zoning district shall apply, with the following exception: for single-family dwellings on substandard width lots, an interior side setback may be reduced by half the lot width shortage provided such reduction does not exceed 25 percent of the required yard width.

    a. For purposes of this subsection, the term “nonconforming site feature” includes, but is not limited to, any driveway, off-street parking or loading area, buffer, landscaping, screening, or exterior lighting element that lawfully existed per regulations in place prior to the effective date of this Code, as well as the lack of any such feature required by subsequently enacted City regulations.
    b. A nonconforming site feature may continue to exist even though it does not conform to current applicable standards of this Code, subject to the requirements of this subsection.
    c. No action shall be taken that increases the degree of the nonconformity of a site feature.
(2) Nonconforming Parking
    a. Continuation of Nonconforming Parking
    Any parking spaces or access to public rights-of-way lawfully existing on the effective date of this Code that are made nonconforming by virtue of enactment of this Code shall be allowed to continue; provided, that:
        1. Any change or expansion of any use or structure shall only be permitted if the additional number of parking spaces required by such change or expansion is provided in accordance with Section 5.5, Off-Street Parking and Loading. For purposes of this provision, a change of use shall include reversion to a use that previously existed on a site but has not operated in more than one year.
        2. Nonconforming parking areas shall not be expanded, except pursuant to subsection F(2)(b) below.
    b. Upgrading Nonconforming Parking
    Nonconforming off-street parking facilities shall be upgraded to comply with this Code’s minimum parking lot design requirements in Section 5.5.F, Off-Street Parking Layout and Design, and landscaping requirements in Section 5.6.C(2)b, Parking Lot Landscaping, when any development occurs that would result in an addition to or expansion of one or more buildings or structures that would increase the total gross floor area of the buildings or structures by more than 50 percent.
(3) Nonconforming Buffers, Landscaping, Screening, and Exterior Lighting
Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, nonconforming buffers, landscaping, screening elements, and exterior lighting shall be upgraded to comply with this Code’s applicable standards for such features if any of the following development activities are proposed for the site containing the nonconforming site feature:
    a. An increase in the total square footage of the vehicular use area, including parking, loading, circulation, and driveway areas;
    b. A structural addition that increases the combined total gross floor area of all existing structures by more than 500 square feet or 20 percent, whichever is less;
    c. Building elevation changes involving 50 percent or more of the exterior walls of a roofed structure on the property within a two-year period, excluding minor cosmetic maintenance such as painting, replacing lighting fixtures, or replacing awnings or signs;
    d. Any tenant change of a stand-alone nonresidential structure that also involves substantial building elevation changes as determined by the Director, excluding minor cosmetic maintenance such as painting, replacing lighting fixtures, or replacing awnings or signs;
    e. Any tenant change of a nonresidential structure that is the anchor tenant of the property that also involves substantial building elevation changes as determined by the Director, excluding minor cosmetic maintenance such as painting, replacing lighting fixtures, or replacing awnings or signs;
    f. On a site containing nonconforming buffers or screening, expansion of outdoor operations, storage, or display that increases the gross square footage of such areas by a certain percentage, shall require upgrading to offset a corresponding percentage of the buffer or screening nonconformity.

G. Nonconforming Signs
(1) Maintenance
Any nonconforming sign may be continued in use; provided, however, that in the event any such sign is hereafter damaged to exceed 50 percent of the reproduction value according to appraisal thereof by competent appraisers, or is removed by any means whatsoever, including an Act of God, such sign may be restored, reconstructed, altered or repaired only to conform with the provisions of this Code.
(2) Alteration and Replacement
    a. Alteration to nonconforming signs may be made only if such alteration will bring such sign into conformity with the provisions of this Code.
    b. However, if the sign is on a separate structure specifically built for the purpose of displaying a sign, the sign face or sign panel within a nonconforming sign structure may be replaced with a new sign for the same or a new use provided the sign structure is not changed or altered in any manner and the panel is essentially the same size and dimensions, and provided all other applicable provisions of this Code are addressed in a conforming manner, including, at a minimum, the following:
        1. Sign color;
        2. Sign legibility (items of information and font styles); and
        3. Sign illumination.
    c. When altering a sign that is nonconforming due to height or size, all incentives available to allow for an increase to the height and/or size of the sign shall be applied prior to a permit for the alteration being approved.
    d. Replacement of individual tenant panels on an existing monument sign shall comply with sign color and sign legibility requirements on their own, not necessarily for the entire sign.

H. Illegal Nonconformities
An illegal nonconformity exists when:
(1) A nonconforming structure is destroyed or substantially destroyed or neglected by an intentional act of the owner or an agent without a proper permit. If this occurs, the nonconforming structure shall lose its nonconforming status and thereafter shall be required to be in conformity with existing codes. If a nonconforming use was in the destroyed or substantially destroyed structure, the nonconforming use and all site improvements shall lose their nonconforming status and be required thereafter to come into compliance with existing codes.
(2) A use, structure, or site improvement occurs to a nonconformity without being lawfully authorized in accordance with the provisions of this section. Such use and/or structure shall therefore cease all operations until such time that the required plans and/or permits are approved.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

B. Official Zoning District Map
(1) Incorporation of Map
    a. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Code are shown upon the Official Zoning Map.
    b. The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk, and shall bear the seal of the City and the date of adoption.
    c. The Official Zoning Map shall be located in the office of the Director and shall be available for inspection at the City Clerk’s Office and/or the Sedona Community Development Department.
    d. The Official Zoning Map shall be maintained by the Sedona Community Development Department. Official zoning districts shall be determined by the Director, where the Official Zoning Map does not reflect recent changes.
(2) Zoning District Boundaries
    a. Except where otherwise indicated, zoning district boundaries shall follow municipal corporation limits, section lines, lot lines, centerlines of public rights-of-way, or extensions of such lines.
    b. Where the zoning district boundary follows the centerline of Oak Creek, the boundary shall follow the channel centerline of the creek. In the event of a natural change in the location of the creek, the zoning district boundary shall move with the channel centerline.
    c. Where a zoning district boundary divides a lot or parcel, or follows or crosses property that is not subdivided, the location of such boundary, unless indicated by legal description with distance and bearing or other dimension, shall be determined by the scale of the Official Zoning Map by the Director.
    d. Where a zoning district boundary coincides with a right-of-way line and the right-of-way line is abandoned, the zoning district boundary shall then follow the adjacent zoning district boundary.
    e. Where a zoning district boundary is shown by specific dimension, such dimension shall determine the limits of the zoning district.
(3) Boundary Clarification
    a. In the event that a zoning district boundary is unclear or is disputed, the Director shall determine the location of the zoning district boundary.
    b. Any appeal of the Director’s determination of the zoning district boundary shall be heard by the Board of Adjustment/Hearing Officer per Section 8.8.D, Appeal.
(4) Amendments to Map
Changes in the boundaries of any zoning district require an amendment to the Official Zoning Map per Section 8.6.A, Rezoning (Zoning Map Amendment). Amendments shall be noted on the Zoning District Map with the case number, the number of the amending ordinance, and the previous and amended zoning.
(5) Annexations
City zoning shall be adopted as soon as practicable for areas annexed by the City. In cases where new zoning is not proposed, the RS-70 district shall be applied to the annexed area(s).

C. Organization of this Article
(1) Base Zoning Districts
    a. Content
    Sections 2.2 through 2.19 of this article follow a common structure and describe the purpose and intended character of the zoning districts, the lot and building standards applying to development in the districts, and any district-specific development standards. Tables of “Other Standards” are included to highlight many commonly referenced standards such as off-street parking and landscaping requirements; however, these tables are illustrative only and do not include the full range of requirements of this Code that may apply to a particular project.
    b. Graphics
    For each base zoning district, this article includes an illustration depicting how the district’s lot and building standards apply to lots and typical building forms. Illustrations are intended to exemplify the general character of the district and do not show specific locations or buildings. Illustrations do not necessarily reflect all the standards that may apply to a particular development. If a standard shown in an illustration is inconsistent with the respective table of lot and building standards, the standards in the table shall govern.
    [IMAGE: <2.1C.png>]
(2) Overlay Districts
    a. Overlay zoning districts are established by an amendment to the Official Zoning Map (see Section 8.6.A, Rezoning (Zoning Map Amendment). They are superimposed over one or more underlying base or planned development zoning districts. If the standards for an overlay district expressly conflict with those for an underlying base zoning district, planned development district, or another applicable overlay district, the more restrictive standards shall apply.
    b. Section 2.22, Overlay Districts, identifies the overlay zoning districts and sets forth each district’s purpose and the standards that modify those of underlying districts.
(3) Obsolete Districts
    a. The RS-5A, Special Use (SU), and Parking (P) zoning districts are declared obsolete upon adoption of this Code.
    b. No land will be rezoned to an obsolete zoning district. The City Council may modify the allowed uses, special uses, and development standards within these zoning districts. Landowners are encouraged to rezone land from an obsolete zoning district classification. The Council may offer incentives, such as modified application fees, in order to accomplish this goal.
    c. Development in an obsolete zoning district is subject to the requirements and conditions that were in place at the time the properties were rezoned under the 1995 Land Development Code (as amended). In addition, all other standards of this Code shall apply to obsolete zoning districts, including the standards in in Article 5: Development Standards, and Article 7: Subdivision, unless otherwise stated in the requirements and conditions in place at the time the properties were rezoned under the 1995 Land Development Code (as amended).

2.21. PD: Planned Development District

A. Purpose
The Planned Development district is intended to achieve the following purposes:
(1) To implement the Sedona Community Plan and Community Focus Area plans;
(2) To allow various combinations of land uses;
(3) To ensure compatibility between residential and nonresidential and/or mixed-use areas and to minimize potential noise and visual impacts to residential areas from adjacent more intensive uses; and
(4) To facilitate development by permitting greater flexibility than allowed by the strict application of the Code in exchange for more creative and imaginative designs with a higher level of amenities and public benefits than is otherwise possible under the base zoning districts.

B. Establishment of a Planned Development District
Planned development districts are established by the City’s approval of a PD rezoning pursuant to Section 8.6.B, Rezoning to Planned Development District. The PD procedure shall not be used when a conditional use permit, variance, minor modification, or rezoning to a base zoning district could achieve a similar result.

C. PD Lot and Building Standards
Development in a PD district is subject to standards included in, or referenced in, an approved PD development plan.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

2.22. Overlay Districts

A. H: Historic
(1) Purpose
The Historic district is intended to promote the use of historic areas for the education and welfare of the community; to encourage the retention of historic properties and to keep them in active use and in their original appearance, setting, and placement; to ensure harmonious growth and development by encouraging the preservation and rehabilitation of Historic districts. It is also intended that new or remodeled structures located within Historic districts be designed and constructed to harmonize with structures located within the immediate vicinity in order to maintain the character of the district and preserve property values.
(2) Applicability
Properties zoned as an Historic district retain the uses of and are subject to the regulations of the underlying base zoning district. In the case where historic preservation and zoning regulations conflict, Section 8.7, Historic Preservation Procedures, takes precedence.
(3) Establishment of an Historic District
Historic districts are established by the City’s approval of a rezoning pursuant to Section 8.6.A, Rezoning (Zoning Map Amendment).

A. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to provide uniform methods of measurement for interpretation and enforcement of the lot and building standards in this Code.

B. Density
(1) Calculation Generally
Density shall be calculated by the number of dwelling units per acre within a proposed development site, excluding public and private streets and rights-of-way, and public access easements that restrict the surface use of the property.
(2) Calculation for Co-Housing, Live/Work, and Multifamily Dwellings
Solely for purposes of calculating density, the number of dwelling units shall be calculated for co-housing, live/work, and multifamily dwellings as follows:

(3) Affordable Housing Exemption
Dwelling units that are deed-restricted to meet the City’s affordable housing criteria in the Development Incentives and Guidelines for Affordable Housing (DIGAH) shall be exempt from density calculations. Such qualifying affordable units shall be deed-restricted for a minimum of 30 years.

C. Lot and Space Requirements
(1) Minimum Lot Dimensions
    a. Any lot that is created, developed, used, or occupied shall meet the minimum lot size and frontage requirements set forth in this article for the zoning district in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this Code for particular uses. New lots shall also meet the development standards set forth in Section 7.3, Subdivision Standards.
    b. No space needed to meet the width, setback, area, open space, impervious coverage, parking, or other requirements of this Code for a lot or building may be sold or leased away from such lot or building.
    c. No parcel of land that has less than the minimum lot width or lot area requirements for the zoning district in which it is located may be divided from a larger parcel of land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of building or development as a lot.
(2) Number of Principal Buildings or Uses per Lot
    a. Except for projects approved as co-housing pursuant to Section 3.3.A(1), Dwelling, Co-Housing, only one principal building for single-family uses or duplexes, with permitted accessory buildings, may be located upon a lot or unplatted tract. Every dwelling shall have legal means of access to a right-of-way.
    b. Where a lot or tract of land is used for multifamily, mixed-use, commercial, or industrial purposes, more than one principal building may be located upon the lot but only when such buildings conform to all requirements of this Code applicable to the uses and district.
    c. No lot shall be divided to contain more dwelling units than are permitted by the regulations of the zoning district in which they are located.

D. Setbacks
(1) Measurement
Setbacks referred to in this Code shall be measured as stated in the definitions article (Article 9) under the term “setback.”
(2) Setback from National Forest Lands
For all zoning districts, the setback from National Forest lands shall be a minimum of 20 feet.
(3) Single-Family Attached and Multifamily Dwellings
    a. Multifamily dwellings on one lot shall be construed as one structure for purpose of measuring setbacks. (See “a” in Figure 2-1.)
    b. For purposes of setback calculations for side-by-side single-family attached or multifamily dwellings, only those dwelling units that do not share a common wall with an adjacent unit (end units) need observe the required side setback for the district. (See “b” in Figure 2-1.)Figure 2-1: Setbacks for Single-Family Attached and Multifamily Dwellings

    +-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
(5) Steep Slopes
The Director may require greater setbacks for properties in the mixed-use and nonresidential districts to avoid development of steep slopes adjacent to public rights-of-way.
(6) Contextual Front Setbacks
The front setback for infill development may be established as a range based on the locations of the primary structures on abutting lots in the same zoning district located on the same street frontage as, and on each side of, the subject lot (e.g., two abutting lots set the range), as approved by the Director. (See Figure 2-2.)Figure 2-2: Contextual Setbacks
[IMAGE: contextual setbacks <2-2.png>]
(7) Corner Lots
On corner lots, front setbacks shall be established along the shorter property line abutting a street. (See Figure 2-3.) The Director, at their sole discretion, may allow the front setback to be established along the longer property line in instances such as:
    a. The building entrance is provided along the longer property line;
    b. The building has multiple entrances; and/or
    c. The longer property line is less than 20 percent longer than the shorter property line.Figure 2-3: Corner Lots
[IMAGE: corner lots <2-3.png>]
(8) Corner Sight Distance
On any corner lot where a front and side setback are required, all development activity and site improvements shall comply with Section 5.4.F, Visibility Triangles.
(9) Double-Frontage Lots
In the case of double-frontage lots, front setbacks shall be provided on all frontages. (See Figure 2-4.)Figure 2-4: Double-Frontage Lots
[IMAGE: double frontage <2-4.png>]
(10) Irregularly Shaped Lots
    a. Generally
    Structures on irregularly shaped lots shall comply with the following:
        1. Lots with multiple street frontages, except for corner lots, shall be required to comply with front setbacks along each lot line abutting a street.
        2. Lots with multiple side and/or rear lot lines not abutting a street shall comply with side setback requirements for all lot lines except that any lot line abutting a street shall comply with the front setback and the lot line farthest from the front lot line shall comply with the rear setback. (See Figure 2-5.)
    b. Alternatives Approved by Director
    The Director may establish alternative setbacks for properties with irregularly shaped lots based on unique site and/or lot conditions.Figure 2-5: Irregularly Shaped Lots
    [IMAGE: irregularly shaped lots <2-5.png>]

E. Building Height
(1) Measurement
    a. Generally
    The height of a building shall be measured as the vertical distance above the natural grade to the top of a flat roof or parapet, the deck line of a mansard roof, or to the top of the ridgeline of the highest gable of a pitched roof or hip roof.
    b. Previously Developed and/or Graded Sites
    On previously developed and/or graded sites, the Director may require an alternative determination of the location of natural grade from which height will be measured from, based on previous grading and the surrounding natural grade.
    c. Plane Options
    Building height is measured by establishing:
        1. Horizontal Plane
        An imaginary horizontal plane, from the highest point at natural grade within the footprint of the building. No part of a building or structure shall exceed 22 feet in height for single-family uses or 25 feet for multifamily uses, as measured from this plane, except for those authorized exceptions in Section 2.24.E(3). Commercial, mixed-use, and other nonresidential buildings may not use this plane measurement. (See “1” in Figure 2-6); and
        2. Parallel Plane
        An imaginary plane that parallels the existing natural terrain, measured vertically from any point of the building or structure to natural grade. No part of a building or structure, exclusive of the exceptions in Section 2.24.E(3) and/or the alternate standards in Section 2.24.E(4), shall exceed 22 feet in height as measured from this plane. Commercial, mixed-use, and other nonresidential buildings shall use this plane measurement. (See “2” in Figure 2-6.)
    d. Areas of rugged terrain with a width of less than 25 feet shall not be included when establishing imaginary planes.Figure 2-6: Building Height
[IMAGE: building height <2-6.png>]
(2) Maximum Overall Building or Structure Height
In addition to the maximum height requirements as stated in Section 2.24.E(1)c, Plane Options, the maximum overall height of any building or structure shall not exceed 40 feet measured vertically from the highest parapet or roof ridge to the natural or finish grade at the lowest point adjacent to the building exterior, excluding posts and masonry piers supporting decks or patios. This maximum height limitation applies to flat, gable, and pitched roofs, but shall not apply to the other generally established exceptions set forth in Table 2.7. (See Figure 2-7.)Figure 2-7: Maximum Overall Building Height
[IMAGE: max overall building height <2-7.png>]
(3) Exceptions to Height Requirements
No building or part of a building shall exceed the maximum building height within any zoning district unless authorized in the table below or elsewhere in this Code.

(4) Alternate Height Standards
The alternate height standards in this section apply only to projects that measure height pursuant to the parallel plane option in Section 2.24.E(1)c.2.
    a. Multiple Buildings Located on One Site
        1. Where three or more buildings are located on a parcel, except for single-family residential uses, the maximum permitted height may be increased to allow greater building height diversity pursuant to the following:
        +--------------+------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
        | Total Number | Number of Buildings Eligible | Maximum Amount of Height Increase |
        | of Buildings |     for Increased Height     |                                   |

        +--------------+------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
        2. Increases in height for multiple buildings located on a site shall not create adverse impacts on adjacent properties or the community, and such buildings shall comply with all applicable standards in Section 5.7, Site and Building Design.
    b. Wall Plane Relief and Reduced Light Reflectance Values (LRV)
        1. An applicant may be eligible for greater height limits than otherwise established in this Code, as measured by the established imaginary plane in Section 2.24.E(1)c.2, provided the proposed development accumulates credits for unrelieved building planes or light reflectance values pursuant to Table 2.9, below. Each credit point earned is valued at one-half foot in greater height eligibility. Credit points can be earned by complying with either the largest unrelieved building plane requirement and/or the LRV percentage reduction.
        2. The maximum additional height allowed through any single wall plane relief or reduced light reflectance value alternate standard, or combination of wall plane relief and reduced light reflectance value alternate height standards, shall not exceed five feet.
Example: If the maximum height is 22 feet and the applicant earns six credit points, then the eligible height increase is three feet for a total of 25 feet maximum height. The six credit points can be earned independently or in combination. An applicant could earn two credit points for a 500 square foot largest unrelieved building plane, and another four credit points for an LRV percentage of 22.

F. Impervious Coverage
(1) Total Impervious Coverage Calculation
The area of the lot covered by the following shall be included in the calculation of total impervious coverage in all districts:
    a. Principal buildings;
    b. Accessory buildings, parking garages, carports, and utility and storage sheds;
    c. Porches, stairways, elevated walkways, paved areas, or areas otherwise covered with materials impervious to water; and
    d. Parking areas and driveways, regardless of surfacing materials unless an alternative pervious paving system is approved by the Director.
(2) Building Coverage Calculation
The area of the lot covered by the following shall be included in the calculation of building impervious coverage in all districts:
    a. Principal buildings; and
    b. Accessory buildings, parking garages, carports, and utility and storage sheds.
(3) Grading and Drainage
As impervious coverage increases, there may be additional need for drainage provisions, including retention and detention systems. See Section 5.3, Grading and Drainage.

G. Minor Modification
In addition to the generally applicable exceptions to the rules of measurement set forth in this section, also see Section 8.8.B, Minor Modification. All available incentives and allowances in this Code shall be used before a minor modification may be considered.

Article 3: Use Regulations

Sections:
3.1.        Purpose and Organization of this Article
3.2.        Table of Allowed Uses
3.3.        Use-Specific Standards
3.4.        Accessory Uses and Structures
3.5.        Temporary Uses and Structures

3.1. Purpose and Organization of this Article

A. Purpose
This article identifies the land uses allowed in Sedona’s zoning districts and establishes standards that apply to certain uses with unique characteristics or impacts.

B. Organization
(1) Section 3.2, Table of Allowed Uses, lists uses allowed by district and provides cross-references to applicable use-specific standards.
(2) Section 3.3, Use-Specific Standards, establishes use-specific standards applicable to specific land uses.
(3) Section 3.4, Accessory Uses and Structures, establishes standards applicable to accessory uses and structures.
(4) Section 3.5, Temporary Uses and Structures, establishes standards applicable to temporary uses and structures.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

3.2. Table of Allowed Uses
Table 3.1 lists the uses allowed within all base zoning districts. Each listed use is defined in Section 9.4, Use-Related Definitions.

A. Explanation of Table Abbreviations
(1) Uses Permitted By-Right
A “P” in a cell indicates that the use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of the LDC.
(2) Uses Requiring a Conditional Use Permit
A “C” in a cell indicates that the use is only permitted in the respective zoning district with approval of a conditional use permit pursuant to Section 8.4.B, Conditional Use Permit.
(3) Prohibited Uses
A blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective zoning district.
(4) Accessory Uses
An “A” in a cell indicates that the use is only permitted in the respective zoning district as an accessory use. If the letter “A” is accompanied by the letter “C” in the same cell, the use is only permitted in the respective zoning district as an accessory use and requires approval of a conditional use permit pursuant to Section 8.4.B, Conditional Use Permit.
(5) Use-Specific Standards
Regardless of whether or not a use is allowed by right or with approval of a conditional use permit, additional standards may be applicable to that use. Use-specific standards are identified and cross-referenced in the last column of Table 3.1.

B. Table Organization
In Table 3.1, land uses and activities are classified into general use categories and specific use types based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. This classification provides a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. This classification does not list every use or activity that may appropriately exist within each use category. Certain uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably have been listed in one or more other categories. The use categories are intended as an indexing tool and are not regulatory. For example, the use category “Residential” contains two use subcategories “Household Living” and “Group Living.” Specific use types such as “Dwelling, Duplex” and “Assisted Living Facility” are regulatory.

C. Use for Other Purposes Prohibited
Approval of a use listed in Table 3.1, and compliance with the applicable use-specific standards for that use, authorizes that use only. Buildings and structures shall not be erected, altered, or enlarged except for the uses listed in Table 3.1. All other uses not specifically listed are prohibited and shall be unlawful unless the Director has determined an appropriate use type for the unlisted use pursuant to the procedure in subsection D below.

D. Classification of New and Unlisted Uses
The following procedure shall apply if an application is submitted for a use type that is not specifically listed in Table 3.1. Submission and approval of such an application shall be required prior to approval of any other permit or development approval associated with the use.
(1) Director Determination of Appropriate Use Type
The Director shall determine the appropriate use type for the proposed use. In making such determination, the Director shall consider the potential impacts of the proposed use including the nature of the use and whether it includes dwellings, sales, processing, or storage; and typical operations, employment characteristics, nuisances, requirements for public utilities, and transportation requirements.
(2) Uses and Use-Specific Standards Requiring a Code Text Amendment
In making a determination on a new or unlisted use, the Director may determine that such new or unlisted use requires a text amendment of this Code. The Director may also determine that Code text amendments for additional use-specific standards are necessary to reduce potential impacts to surrounding properties or the community. Code text amendments shall follow the procedures in Section 8.6.C.
(3) Appeal of Director’s Determination
An appeal of the Director’s determination shall be made pursuant to the procedures in Section 8.8.D, Appeal.

B. Approvals Required
All applications for PWSF shall be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission (Commission) at a public hearing as set forth in Section 8.4.B, Conditional Use Permit, based on potential location, aesthetic or visually related impacts as a result of the proposed antenna’s height, color, size and the like, except as set forth below.
(1) All applications for: (a) concealed replacement tower collocations that do not constitute a “substantial change” on an existing tower or base station that has been designed and approved to accommodate multiple wireless collocations; or (b) replacements of existing nonconcealed towers with concealed towers; shall each be subject to review and approval by the Director, relative to the review criteria provided in Section 4.3.C, Approval Criteria.
(2) All applications for any wireless communication facilities within a ROW that meet the eligibility criteria for “small cell facilities” in A.R.S. §9-591 et seq. shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer in accordance with the provisions of application processes and approval criteria that are set forth in Title 12, Sedona City Code and A.R.S. §9-591.

C. Approval Criteria
In considering any application for a conditional use permit for the establishment of a tower or base station, the Director or Commission’s decision shall be guided by the application of the following criteria:
(1) Use of suitable existing towers or base stations is preferred over placement of new towers;
(2) New base stations that do not exceed height limitations for the zoning district are preferred over base stations that do exceed the height limitation for the zoning district;
(3) Concealed wireless communication facilities that cannot be readily observable by pedestrians on adjacent streets to such facility are preferred over facilities that are readily observable by pedestrians on adjacent streets;
(4) Collocation of multiple uses on a single wireless communication facility will have significant favorable weight in evaluating the application;
(5) Network development plans that achieve the fewest number of wireless communication facilities of all users reasonably necessary for commercial coverage are preferred;
(6) Location in nonresidential zoning districts is preferred over residential districts;
(7) Suitability of the location for collocation of governmental public service wireless service facilities.

D. Location by Zoning District
(1) Generally
    a. No wireless communication facilities shall be allowed in any Open Space Districts.
    b. Wireless communication facilities may be permitted in the following districts subject to approval by the Director or Commission as set forth in Section 4.3.B, Approvals Required.

        4. Antenna heights and power levels of the proposed facility and all other facilities on the subject property; and
        5. A statement from the applicant that demonstrates that alternative locations, configurations and facility types have been examined; and addresses in narrative form the feasibility of any alternatives that may have fewer adverse effects on adjacent properties than the facility, configuration and location proposed including but not limited to:
            i. Height;
            ii. Mass and scale;
            iii. Materials and color;
            iv. Illumination; and
            v. Information addressing the following items:
                a. The extent of any commercial development within the geographic search ring of the proposed facility;
                b. The proximity of the structure to any residential dwellings;
                c. The proximity of the structure to any public buildings or facilities;
                d. The existence of tall and like structures within the geographic search ring of the proposed structure.
    q. Citizen Participation Plan and Report as set forth in Section 8.3.D, Citizen Review Process, when a conditional use permit is required.
    r. A statement that the proposed facility conforms with state of the art, as defined herein, or alternatively, that state of the art technology is unsuitable for the proposed facility and the basis for same. Costs of state of the art technology that exceed facility development costs shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
    s. Any other materials and data as may be required by the Director.

F. Expert Review

(3) Nonconformities
The standards of this Code relating to nonconformities may also apply to redevelopment activities. See Section 1.6, Nonconformities.

C. Planned Developments
(1) Development within any new planned development established after the effective date of this Code shall be subject to this Article 5: Development Standards, unless alternative standards are adopted as part of the PD approval that, in the determination of the Director, are at least equal to the standards set forth in this article.
(2) Development of a residential structure within an existing planned development established prior to the effective date of this Code is exempt from this Article 5: Development Standards.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

5.3. Grading and Drainage

A. Purpose
This section establishes standards that regulate earthwork construction, including excavation, embankments, grading, and drainage on property located within the City, in order to reduce siltation into Oak Creek and to protect, preserve, and enhance the natural environment, including natural land forms and vegetation.

B. Applicability
(1) Generally
    a. No person shall do any work in or over any drainage way or floodplain, nor shall any person do any grading, filling, excavating, cutting, or other site earthwork, without first obtaining the proper permit and/or authorization pursuant to the Engineering Manual.
    b. In no case shall alteration of any drainage way identified in the 1994 SCS Floodplain Management Study as a permanent or intermittent watercourse be permitted, except as allowed in Section 5.3.B(2), Exemptions.
    c. Submittals for development of individual residential lots within flood-prone areas shall comply with the City’s Engineering Manual and with the requirements of the Arizona Department of Water Resources State Standard 6-05 and associated attachments, as they currently exist or may be amended in the future.
(2) Exemptions
    a. Generally
    Unless otherwise provided in this Code, written authorization shall not be required, nor shall the City prohibit:
        1. The construction of bridges, culverts, dikes and other structures necessary to the construction of public highways, public roads, and streets intersecting a watercourse;
        2. Any flood control district, county, city, or town or other political subdivision from exercising powers granted to it under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 21, Flood Control Districts; or
        3. The construction of streams, waterways, lakes, and other auxiliary facilities in conjunction with the development of public parks and recreation facilities by a federal or state public agency or a political subdivision of the state of Arizona.
    b. Existing Development
    Unless otherwise provided in this Code, this this section shall not apply to:
        1. Existing legal uses of property or the right to continuation of such legal use, and reasonable repair or alteration of such property pursuant to Section 1.6, Nonconformities;
        2. Reasonable repair of structures constructed with the written authorization required by A.R.S. § 48-3613;
        3. Facilities constructed or installed pursuant to a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility issued pursuant to A.R.S. Title 40, Chapter 2, Article 6.2, Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Committee; and
        4. Improvements to existing streets or highways, or improvements to existing fill slopes, that do not conform with this this section that is authorized in writing by the City Engineer.
    c. Liability
    These exemptions do not preclude any person from liability if that person’s actions increase flood hazards to any other person or property. Neither the issuance of a building permit, nor compliance with the provisions of this this section, or with any conditions imposed in the building permit, shall relieve any person from responsibility for damage to other persons or property, nor impose any liability upon the City for damage to other persons or property.

C. Compliance Required
(1) All earthwork construction and storm water management systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the provisions of this Code, the Engineering Standards Manual, and the standards of other applicable regulating authorities.
(2) In the case where requirements in this Code conflict with requirements in the Engineering Standards Manual, Yavapai County Flood Control District, or Coconino County Flood Control District, the more stringent requirement as determined by the City Engineer shall apply.
(3) The provisions in this this section shall not be construed to prevent the enforcement of other laws that prescribe more restrictive limitations, nor be presumed to waive any limitations imposed by other statutes or ordinances.

D. General Standards
(1) Grading and Slope Protection
In addition to the grading standards in the Engineering Standards Manual, the following general standards shall apply:
    a. All buildings, structures, driveways, and roads shall, to the maximum extent practicable, follow the natural contours of the land to minimize disturbed area.
    b. Grading and cut-and-fill practices shall be minimized and shall blend scale, form, and visual character into the natural landforms and minimize exposed scars. Level grading of entire lots without respect for existing landforms or neighboring development is prohibited.
    c. Sharp angles shall be rounded off, in a natural manner, at the top and ends of cut and fill slopes (within approximately five feet of the sharp angle) unless steep angles are a natural character of the site. Where this would damage tree root systems, the amount of rounding off may be reduced and shrubs used instead to hide the transition.
    d. Except for driveways, cut-and-fill slopes shall be entirely contained within a lot and natural grade at the lot lines shall be maintained.
    e. Where the existing terrain is generally level, slopes greater than 1:3 are prohibited within five feet of property lines.
    f. Finished floor elevations of buildings and parking areas shall transition with the grades of the site.
    g. On sloped properties, structures shall be designed to step down with the existing topography. Building placement on slopes shall incorporate stepped vertical massing and plan view offsets to save existing vegetation and landforms.
(2) Storm Drainage Facilities
In addition to the storm water management standards in the Engineering Standards Manual, the following general standards shall apply:
    a. Generally
        1. All developments shall be designed with considerations for existing, temporary, and post-development drainage impacts and flows. These considerations shall include quantity, quality, and method of delivery of drainage flows.
        2. Project designs shall provide drainage or storm water capture/low-impact development measures on the project site so that off-site storm drainage flows do not increase, are not more polluted, or differently delivered than existing flows, unless adequate provisions satisfactory to the City Engineer are made to accommodate the flow off site.
    b. Design measures shall be implemented to prevent nonstorm drainage flows from flowing between or off of properties.
    c. All development proposals shall, to the maximum extent feasible, preserve existing drainage courses in as natural a manner as possible. Storm water may be directed into natural or landscaped areas where infiltration can occur (bio-retention basins, swales, rain gardens).
    d. No obstruction, including walls and fences, shall be placed within a drainage facility, roadside ditch, wash, or drainage easement, unless authorized by the City Engineer.
    e. Maintain existing riparian areas in undisturbed form unless authorized by the City Engineer.
(3) Detention Basins
Detention basins can serve multiple purposes, including removing sediment from storm water runoff and reducing runoff. Detention basins shall be designed as natural-looking and usable resources and shall:
    a. Be designed in free-form shapes to blend with the natural landscape. They may be integrated into a park or recreation area with controlled access and signage that provides for the safe public use of such areas.
    b. Be landscaped to serve as areas of visual interest, and to soften their appearance.
    c. Incorporate landscape materials that are consistent with the overall landscape palette of the project and that comply with the standards in Section 5.6, Landscaping, Buffering, and Screening.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

5.4. Access, Connectivity, and Circulation

A. Purpose
The purpose of this Section 5.4 is to support the creation of a highly connected transportation system within the City in order to:
(1) Promote multimodal travel in Sedona by providing options for automobiles, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians;
(2) Connect neighborhoods to each other;
(3) Connect neighborhoods to local destinations such as employment, schools, parks, and shopping centers;
(4) Reduce vehicle miles of travel and travel times;
(5) Mitigate the traffic impacts of new development;
(6) Reduce storm water runoff, reducing heat island effect from large expanses of pavement, improving water quality, and minimizing dust pollution;
(7) Improve air quality;
(8) Reduce emergency response times;
(9) Increase effectiveness of local service delivery;
(10) Free up arterial capacity to better serve regional long-distance travel needs; and
(11) Avoid the creation of large, isolated tracts without routes for through traffic or pedestrian and bicycle connections.

B. Applicability
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.4, the standards in this section shall apply to all development.

C. Circulation Plan Required
(1) All development, except for single-family residential uses within previously platted subdivisions, shall prepare a circulation plan. The circulation plan shall meet the requirements of the Administrative Manual, which at minimum shall include:
    a. Street connectivity;
    b. Emergency and service vehicle access;
    c. Parking movements;
    d. Loading operations;
    e. Turning radii;
    f. Traffic calming measures where future “cut-through” traffic is likely; and
    g. Other similar issues identified by the Director.
(2) The Director may waive the requirement for a circulation plan on a case-by-case basis in the event that a development is expected to have no impact upon circulation or proposes no change in existing circulation patterns. This provision shall not be construed to exempt development that includes additional parking, driveways, or substantial modifications to the existing pedestrian network.
(3) A circulation plan shall be submitted with the respective site plan or subdivision application, as appropriate.

D. Street Connectivity
(1) Purpose
Street and block patterns should include a clear hierarchy of well-connected streets that distribute traffic over multiple streets and avoid traffic congestion on principal routes. Within each development, the access and circulation system should accommodate the safe, efficient, and convenient movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians through the development, and provide ample opportunities for linking adjacent neighborhoods, properties, and land uses. Local neighborhood street systems are intended to provide multiple direct connections to and between local destinations such as parks, schools, and shopping.
(2) Standards
    a. Continuation and Connection to Public Roadways
    The vehicular access and circulation for a development shall incorporate the continuation and connection of public street roadways and associated rights-of-way that have been extended or connected to the boundary of the development site from existing or approved abutting developments.
    b. Extension of Circulation System to Site Boundaries
    The vehicular access and circulation for a development shall provide for the extension or connection of proposed internal public street roadways and associated rights-of-way to those boundaries of the development site whenever such extensions or connections are or may be necessary to ensure that the development site or the abutting property will have:
        1. At least two vehicular access points to and from an external through street system;
        2. Convenient and efficient access by vehicles needed to provide police, fire, and emergency services; and
        3. Convenient and efficient access by vehicles needed to provide other public services.
    c. Connection to Bikeways and Sidewalks
    An extension or connection of a public street roadway and right-of-way to an abutting property, street, or right-of-way shall include the extension or connection of associated bikeways and sidewalks.
    d. Temporary Turnaround
    The Director and/or the City Engineer may require a temporary turnaround at the end of a roadway extension if needed to facilitate traffic flow or to accommodate emergency vehicles pending the roadway’s connection to other roadways.
    e. Waiver or Modification of Connection Requirements
    The Director and/or the City Engineer may waive or modify the requirements or standards for extension or connection of a public roadway from or to an abutting property if such extension is impractical or undesirable because it would:
        1. Require crossing a significant physical barrier or environmentally sensitive area (e.g., watercourses, floodplains, riparian areas, steep slopes, wildfire hazard areas);
        2. Require the extension or connection of a proposed internal public street to an abutting property with existing development whose design makes it unlikely that the street will ever be part of a network of public streets (for example, the abutting existing development has no public streets, or there are no “stubbed-out” street rights-of-way or open corridors between the proposed development site and public streets in the abutting development to accommodate a current or future extension or connection);
        3. Require the extension or connection of a proposed internal public street to an abutting property owned by a government or public utility to which vehicular access is restricted, or other property to which vehicular access is restricted by easement or deed; or
        4. Require the extension or connection of a proposed internal public street to an abutting property that is developed or zoned for a use whose level and type of generated traffic would be incompatible with the proposed development.
(3) Cul-de-Sacs and Dead-End Streets
    a. Where residential developments have cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets, such streets shall be connected to the closest local or collector street or to cul-de-sacs in adjoining subdivisions via a sidewalk or multi-use path, except where deemed impractical by the Director.
    b. All stub streets and temporary dead-end streets greater than 150 feet in length shall terminate in a cul-de-sac.
(4) Gates and Restrictions on Access to Streets, Driveways, or Alleys
The standards of this subsection apply to all residential, commercial, and industrial development. They do not apply to individual detached houses with gated private driveways. For the purpose of this provision and this section, the term “gate” means any barrier or similar device that would allow access or passage to a certain person, group of people, or type of traffic and not to the general public or to transient traffic.
    a. Gating of Public Streets
    Public streets, sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and public alleys may not be gated.
    b. Approval Required
    No other street, driveway, sidewalk, bicycle or pedestrian pathway, or alley may be gated and no vehicular or pedestrian/bicycle (traffic) access may be otherwise restricted along any street without the City’s express written approval, in accordance with the standards of this section.
    c. New Streets and Alleys
    Permission to restrict access from public streets to private streets or to gate or otherwise restrict access to private streets, driveways, sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and alleys may be granted by the City Engineer in conjunction with the Director; provided, that the proposed design does not result in a restriction of access to any existing street, sidewalk, bicycle or pedestrian pathway, or alley. Before approval of any restriction on access to a newly created street, sidewalk, bicycle or pedestrian pathway, or alley, the City Engineer in conjunction with the Director shall forward the request to the Sedona Fire District and any other relevant agencies for their review and comment.

E. Driveways and Access
(1) General
    a. Every lot shall have sufficient access providing reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles and for those needing access to the property for its intended use.
    b. All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets shall be constructed so that:
        1. Vehicles may safely enter and exit the property;
        2. Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized; and
        3. Shared driveways are provided to the maximum extent feasible to minimize the number of access points to streets (except for driveways within residential subdivisions or along private residential streets).
    c. Unobstructed, direct, and convenient access for vehicles to and from a public street shall be provided for all off-street parking spaces. Access from any parking area to a public street shall be designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit in forward drive.
    d. All driveways shall be surfaced with materials that have textures and colors that would enhance visual compatibility with native site surroundings. Such materials may include paving blocks or bricks, exposed aggregate concrete and asphalt, but specifically does not include uncolored concrete.
    e. All driveways from existing private or public roads that interfere with a natural or constructed drainage course shall provide a drainage culvert that meets the Engineering Standards.
(2) Driveways Fronting State Highways
Unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer, driveways providing ingress and/or egress from state highways shall comply with the following:
    a. Only one driveway access point per property shall be allowed.
    b. Driveways along state highways shall not be located closer than 40 feet from another driveway.
    c. Access approval from the Arizona Department of Transportation shall be obtained.
(3) Residential
In addition to the above general requirements in Section 5.4.E(1) and (2), all residential development shall be subject to the following:
    a. There shall be no direct driveway access (ingress or egress) from any single-family residential lots to any arterial street or highway unless no other legal access alternative is available.
    b. Multifamily development sites shall include a minimum of two access points to the maximum extent practicable. An exception may be made by the City Engineer where a site is landlocked by existing development or other physical or legal constraints, or where existing natural features on the site require the use of protective measures that would otherwise make a second access drive infeasible, or where the small size of the site makes dual access unnecessary.
    c. Driveways shall be no less than 20 feet in length from the face of a garage, carport, or other structure intended to house vehicles to the near edge of the sidewalk or public right-of-way.
    d. Within the front setback, each driveway at its widest point shall be not more than 30 feet in width, measured at right angles to the center line of the driveway, except as that distance may be increased by permissible curb return radii.
    e. Driveways providing access to single-family residential lots shall be located a minimum of 30 feet from any road intersection.
(4) Nonresidential
In addition to the above general requirements in Section 5.4.E(1) and (2), all nonresidential development shall be subject to the following:
    a. Vehicle Maneuvering
    Vehicles shall not be allowed to back out or otherwise maneuver from a property into a City arterial or roadway if, in the opinion of the City Engineer, a potential traffic safety concern is present.
    b. General Driveway Standards
    All driveways providing access to a public right-of-way shall comply with adopted City Engineering standards.
(5) OC District
In the OC district, the following additional standards apply:
    a. All streets, driveways, parking areas, and walkways shall be surfaced with gravel or other permeable surfacing except where necessary to meet ADA requirements, or where determined to be infeasible, for the scope of the project, or where the Fire District requires a different material.
    b. To limit the number of access points and curb cuts on Schnebly Hill Road, developments shall take access from shared driveways to the maximum extent feasible.

F. Visibility Triangles
(1) On all lots or parcels of land on which a front setback is required, no obstruction that will obscure the view of motor vehicle drivers shall be placed within the triangular area formed by joining points measured 30 feet along the property line from the intersection of two streets, or by joining points measured 10 feet back along a driveway and lot line from the point of intersection of the driveway and lot line. On a site-specific basis; as an alternative, the City Engineer may apply AASHTO standards based on a site-specific evaluation of intersection visibility. (See Figure 5-1.)
(2) Within the area of the triangle there shall be no sight-obscuring or partly obscuring wall, fence, sign, or foliage higher than 36 inches above curb grade or, in the case of trees, foliage lower than six feet.
(3) Vertical measurement shall be made from the top of the curb on the street adjacent to the nearest street of the triangle or, if no curb exists, from the edge of the nearest traveled way.Figure 5-1: Visibility Triangle
[IMAGE: visibility triangle <5-1.png>]

G. Cross-Access between Adjacent Uses
(1) All nonresidential development shall be designed to allow for cross-access to adjacent properties to encourage shared parking and shared access points on public or private streets, even if no current connection exists (in order to enable future connections). This may be established by one or more of the following:
    a. Connecting streets and drives;
    b. Coordinating parking structure and parking lot entrances;
    c. Common service/delivery areas;
    d. Legally shared parking structures and parking lots;
    e. Linkages between parking lots and parking structures; or
    f. Providing shared driveways for two adjacent lots from public rights-of-way to minimize curb cuts.
(2) When cross-access is deemed impractical by the Director and/or City Engineer on the basis of topography, the presence of natural features, or vehicular or pedestrian safety factors, this requirement may be waived provided that appropriate bicycle and pedestrian connections are provided between adjacent developments or land uses.
(3) Cross-access and maintenance agreements associated with such interconnections shall be provided, if necessary, with the associated subdivision or development application.

H. Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation
(1) Sidewalks
    a. Unless exempted in subsection H(1)b of this subsection, sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all arterials, collector streets, and local streets, including cul-de-sacs, and within and along the frontage of all new development or redevelopment.
    b. Sidewalks are not required for:
        1. Existing local streets in single-family residential zoning districts unless called for in an applicable CFA plan; and
        2. Steep-slope areas where sidewalks on one side of the street may be approved to reduce excessive slope disturbance, adverse impacts on natural resources, and potential soil erosion and drainage problems.
(2) On-Site Pedestrian Walkways
All development shall provide an on-site system of pedestrian walkways that meets the following standards:
    a. Areas to Connect
    On-site pedestrian walkways shall provide direct access and connections to and between:
        1. The primary entrance or entrances to each building, including pad site buildings;
        2. Any sidewalks, walkways, or multi-use paths on adjacent properties that extend to the boundaries shared with the development;
        3. Any parking areas intended to serve the development;
        4. Any sidewalk system along the perimeter streets adjacent to the development;
        5. Any public transit station areas, transit stops, park and ride facilities, or other transit facilities on site or along an adjacent street;
        6. Any adjacent residential neighborhoods (planned or existing); and
        7. Any adjacent or on-site public park, trail system, open space, greenway, or other public or civic use or amenity.
    b. Walkway Design
    Required on-site pedestrian walkways shall be a minimum width of five feet; however, the Director and/or City Engineer may require a wider walkway based on site characteristics such as, but not limited to, anticipated pedestrian volume, street classification, zoning of adjacent properties, and location within a CFA. All required walkways shall:
        1. Be distinguishable from areas used by vehicles using one or more of the following techniques:
            i. Changing surfacing material, patterns, and/or paving color, but not including the painting of the paving material;
            ii. Changing paving height;
            iii. Decorative bollards;
            iv. Raised median walkways with landscaped buffers;
        2. Be designed with similar and/or complementary details, colors, and finishes as other interconnected walkways;
        3. Have adequate lighting for security and safety;
        4. Be conveniently and centrally located on the subject property;
        5. Be ADA accessible; and
        6. Not include barriers that limit pedestrian access between the subject property and adjacent properties.
(3) Pedestrian Access through Parking Areas
All parking lots that contain more than 50 parking spaces shall include pedestrian walkways through the parking lot to the primary building entrance or a sidewalk providing access to the primary building entrance. At a minimum, walkways shall be provided for every three driving aisles or at a distance of not more than 150-foot intervals, whichever is less. (See Figure 5-2.)Figure 5-2: Example Pedestrian Access through a Parking Lot
[IMAGE: pedestrian access parking <5-2.png>]
(4) Pedestrian Access through Parking Garages
Pedestrian walkways shall be provided through parking garages from the parking area to the abutting public right-of-way and sidewalk and/or to the primary entrance of the building served. Pedestrian walkways shall not use vehicle entrance or exit driveways from the parking area to a public right-of-way.
(5) Multi-Use Trails
Multi-use trails, separated from automobile traffic, are encouraged to enhance pedestrian and bicycle travel.
    a. Trails shall:
        1. Connect to the street system in a safe and convenient manner;
        2. Be well-signed with destination and directional signing;
        3. Connect origin and destination points such as residential areas, schools, shopping centers, parks, USFS trail systems, etc.; and
        4. Be designed in such a manner that motor vehicle crossings can be eliminated or significantly minimized.
    b. Multi-use trails designated in the Transportation Master Plan (TMP), Community Focus Area Plan, or other specific plan shall require a minimum width of 10 feet, unless an alternative width is required by an adopted CFA plan.
    c. In the OC District:
        1. Public access easements shall be provided to ensure future public access to a continuous and connected trail system.
        2. Trail connections to established National Forest trails shall be provided where appropriate and as approved by representatives of the Coconino National Forest.
        3. Development with frontage on the west side of Schnebly Hill Road shall provide a trail that connects to the sidewalk at the SR 179 roundabout; shall be set back from the road to improve safety; and shall be designed to preserve the historic irrigation ditch to the maximum extent feasible.
        4. Development with frontage on Oak Creek shall provide a publicly accessible trail (“creekwalk”) where appropriate to create a continuous and connected trail parallel to the creek.
        5. The creekwalk and associated amenities shall be designed to have minimal impacts on the riparian habitat and floodway of Oak Creek, with materials and construction that blend with the natural environment.
        6. Trails and pathways shall be surfaced with gravel or other permeable surfacing and be designed to blend with the natural environment and rural character, except where necessary to meet ADA requirements, or where determined to be infeasible, for the scope of the project, or where the Fire District requires a different material.
(6) Use and Maintenance of Sidewalks, Walkways, and Trails
    a. Restrictions on Use
    Sidewalks, walkways, and trails are intended to provide pedestrian and bicycle access. Vehicle parking, garbage containers, merchandise storage or display, utility boxes and poles, signs, trees, and other obstructions shall not encroach into the required minimum width of any required sidewalk, trail, walkway, or other pedestrian way.
    b. Maintenance and Snow Removal
    Sidewalks, trails, and walkways required by this title shall be maintained in usable condition throughout the year.
(7) Bicycle Circulation
Designated bicycle lanes are required in the design of all arterial and collector streets where low traffic speeds and volumes allow bicyclists and motorists to share the road safely.

5.5. Off-Street Parking and Loading

A. Purpose
This section is intended to provide off-street parking and loading facilities in proportion to the generalized parking, loading, and transportation demands of different land uses. This section is also intended to help protect the public health, safety, and general welfare by:
(1) Avoiding and mitigating traffic congestion;
(2) Avoiding and mitigating the adverse visual impact of large concentrations of exposed parking;
(3) Reducing storm water runoff, reducing heat island effect from large expanses of pavement, improving water quality, and minimizing dust pollution;
(4) Providing necessary access for service and emergency vehicles;
(5) Providing for safe and convenient interaction between vehicles and pedestrians; and
(6) Providing flexible methods of responding to the transportation and access demands of various land uses in different areas of the City.

B. Applicability
(1) New Development
Unless otherwise exempted by Section 5.5.B(3), the standards in this Section 5.5 shall apply to all development and land uses established after the effective date of this Code.
(2) Expansions and Enlargements
    a. The off-street parking and loading standards of this Section 5.5 apply when the gross floor area of an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged by 15 percent or more for primary uses of the property, 25 percent or more for supportive nonprimary uses of the property, or for any expansion or enlargement that requires a conditional use permit. In such cases, the number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (pre-existing plus expansion) shall equal 100 percent of the minimum ratio established in Table 5.2, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces.
    b. For single-family detached dwellings, any additional expanded parking provided pursuant to this section shall be restricted to covered parking.
(3) Exemptions
The following shall be exempt from the requirements in Table 5.2, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces, but shall comply with parking area design standards if parking is provided:
    a. Properties containing less than 5,000 square feet of lot area, except for single-family and duplex dwellings.
    b. Expansions or enlargements that increase the square footage of an existing conforming structure or conforming use by less than 15 percent gross floor area; provided, that any existing off-street parking remains unaltered.
(4) Change in Use
Off-street parking and loading shall be provided for any change of use that would result in a requirement for more parking or loading spaces than the existing use as defined in this Section 5.5.
(5) Mixed-Use Development
For new mixed-use development, the total requirement for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately, subject to the modifications set forth below.
    a. To reflect the reduced automobile use associated with mixed-use developments, all uses within a mixed-use zoning district that are part of a mixed-use development shall be eligible for the following reductions from the minimum off-street parking requirements in Table 5.2, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces:
        1. M1 district: 10 percent parking reduction;
        2. M2 district: 15 percent parking reduction; and
        3. M3 district: 30 percent parking reduction.
    b. The total number of parking spaces required of a use or uses may be further reduced by the Director if the applicant prepares a parking demand study that demonstrates a reduction is appropriate based on the expected parking needs of the development, availability of mass transit, and similar factors. The parking and loading demand study shall be prepared pursuant to Section 5.5.C(5), Discretionary Requirement Based on Demand Study.

C. Calculation of Parking and Loading Requirements
(1) Area Measurements
All square-footage based parking and loading requirements shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area of the subject use. Structured parking within a building shall not be counted in such computation.
(2) Fractions
When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction exceeding 0.5 shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
(3) Parking and Loading for Multiple Uses
    a. Lots containing more than one use shall provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.
    b. The total number of spaces may be reduced if the Director approves a parking and loading demand study, prepared by a professional traffic engineer, which shows that on a single auto trip, more than one land use is employed on one lot (see “Shared Parking” published by the Urban Land Institute and Chapter 7, “Parking and Service Facilities,” published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers).
(4) Parking and Loading for Unlisted Uses
For uses not expressly listed in Table 5.2, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces, the Director is authorized to:
    a. Apply the minimum off-street parking space requirement specified in Table 5.2, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces, for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use (based on operating characteristics, the most similar related occupancy classification, or other factors determined by the Director); or
    b. Establish the minimum off-street parking space requirement by reference to parking resources published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) or other acceptable source of parking demand data; or
    c. Establish the minimum off-street parking space and loading requirements based on a parking and loading demand study prepared by the applicant according to Section 5.5.C(5), Discretionary Requirement Based on Demand Study.
(5) Discretionary Requirement Based on Demand Study
Uses that reference this subsection in Table 5.2, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces, have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it difficult to specify a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving an application for a use subject to this subsection, the Director shall apply the off-street parking and loading standards on the basis of a parking and loading demand study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall estimate parking demand for the proposed use based on the recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), Urban Land Institute, the International Council of Shopping Centers, the American Planning Association, or other acceptable source of parking demand data for uses and/or combinations of uses of comparable activities, scale, bulk, area, and location.

D. Minimum Off-Street Parking Spaces Required
(1) Minimum Required Off-Street Parking

(2) Accessible Parking
The number and design of accessible parking spaces shall be pursuant to the International Building Code (IBC) as adopted in the Sedona City Code and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended.
(3) Bicycle Parking
    a. Minimum Required Bicycle Parking
    Unless exempted by Section 5.5.D(3)b, all multifamily and nonresidential development shall provide off-street bicycle parking spaces at a ratio of one bicycle parking space per 10 vehicle parking spaces, with no development providing less than two bicycle parking spaces.
    b. Bicycle Parking Reduction
    The Director may reduce the number of bicycle parking spaces required due to building site characteristics.
    c. Bicycle Parking Location and Design
        1. Location
        Required off-street bicycle parking spaces shall be provided with bike racks, bike lockers, or similar parking facilities that comply with the following standards:
            i. Located in a visible, well-lit ground-level area;
            ii. Conveniently accessible to the primary entrances of a development’s principal building(s);
            iii. Does not interfere with pedestrian traffic; and
            iv. Is protected from conflicts with vehicular traffic.
        2. Multiple Building Developments
        For developments with multiple buildings, bicycle parking shall be distributed evenly among principal buildings.
        3. Design
            i. Bicycle parking areas shall not be used for any other purposes.
            ii. Bicycle parking spaces shall be installed using bicycle racks that are effective for storage and are permanently anchored to a hard surface.
(4) Bus and Large Vehicle Parking
    a. For parking lots with a capacity of more than 50 parking spaces, applicants shall demonstrate ability to accommodate parking for buses, recreational vehicles, and other large, oversized vehicles.
    b. If separate oversized parking spaces are provided to accommodate buses and large vehicles, each oversized parking space may be credited as six standard spaces to satisfy the required number of off-street parking spaces.

E. Parking Alternatives, Credits, and Adjustments
(1) Generally
    a. The Director may approve parking alternatives, credits, and adjustments to the off-street parking spaces required by Table 5.2, Required Off-Street Parking Spaces, in accordance with the standards in this subsection E.
    b. Adjustments to required off-street parking spaces for multifamily dwellings shall not reduce the minimum required amount of parking by more than 20 percent.
(2) Shared Parking or Off-Site Parking
The Director may approve shared parking and/or off-site parking for developments and/or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods, if the shared and/or off-site parking complies with the following:
    a. Location
    Every shared and/or off-site parking space for nonresidential uses shall be located within 500 feet (measured along a legal pedestrian route) of the property on which the shared parking is provided. The Director may authorize farther distances for shared parking facilities where shuttle services are available.
    b. Parking and Loading Demand Study Required
        1. Shared and/or off-site parking shall only be approved if the applicant clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared and/or off-site parking through a parking and loading demand study. Such study shall be prepared pursuant to Section 5.5.C(5), Discretionary Requirement Based on Demand Study.
        2. For shared parking, separate uses located on the same or adjacent properties which are not operated simultaneously, a shared parking arrangement may be allowed if it is in accordance with the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Standards for shared parking (current edition) and the Urban Land Institute publication Shared Parking Second Edition (2005, Mary S. Smith et al.) and approved by the Director.
    c. Parking Agreement Required
        1. Written Agreement
            i. The parties involved in the joint use of shared parking facilities and/or the use of off-site parking facilities shall submit a written agreement to the Director with the following:
                a. A legal written and recorded agreement;
                b. Proof of continuing use and maintenance.
            ii. The City shall be party to the agreement and any subsequent amendments to such agreement.
        2. Approval
            i. Such agreement shall be approved by the Director prior to issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the shared and/or off-site parking facility.
            ii. Subsequent revocation of such agreement may render any parking facilities that do not comply with this Code nonconforming.
(3) Structured Parking
    a. Parking Requirements Reduction
    The Director may reduce off-street parking requirements for developments providing structured parking.
    b. Height of Parking Structure
    The height of a parking structure shall not exceed the height of the principal building it is intended to serve.

The site analysis shall examine a site’s physical properties, amenities, unique attribute, character, and neighboring environment.

D. Site Design
(1) Intent
Site design standards address a development’s relationship to its surrounding natural features and development patterns. They also address the relationship between key elements within the site. Site design standards should be considered at the outset, and throughout, the design process. These standards are intended to:
    a. Ensure development relates to the physical characteristics of the site;
    b. Ensure building scale, orientation, and design relates to the surrounding uses and streets, and creates a cohesive visual identity and an attractive street scene;
    c. Ensure site design for efficient pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and vehicular circulation patterns, and create a high-quality pedestrian environment;
    d. Promote design environments built to human scale;
    e. Ensure delivery, trash, and loading facilities are located so as not to impede regular vehicular and pedestrian circulation and access routes; and
    f. Ensure safe and efficient access between buildings and parking areas.
(2) Responsiveness to Natural Site Conditions and Context
Site design shall respond to the following standards:
    a. General
        1. Building envelopes and areas of disturbance shall be selected on the basis of natural landforms, native vegetation and native mature trees, underlying geology, floodways and floodplains, drainage ways, and required setbacks.
        2. Structures and access shall be designed and located to fit into the topographic contours of the site, minimize disturbance of sensitive areas, and preserve geologic and natural vegetative features. Natural vegetation, significant rock outcroppings, and existing landforms shall be retained to the maximum extent practicable. Flexibility and creativity are encouraged in designing development around existing features.
        3. Site design shall maximize the use of disturbed land for roads, parking areas, or structures in order to preserve natural, undisturbed areas.
    b. Retaining Walls
    Where retaining walls are required, they should be faced with natural rock and/or constructed to blend with adjacent surroundings. If retaining walls are constructed of block and finished with stucco, they shall be painted a dark earth-tone color. The use of dry stack rock walls, where structurally appropriate, is strongly encouraged.
    c. Trees and Vegetation
    Trees and vegetation shall be maintained to provide slope stability and prevent visual scarring wherever possible. Revegetation with native plant materials is encouraged following development. A revegetation landscape plan is required for disturbed site areas.
(3) Sensitive Area Protection in the OC Zoning District
The following standards implement the Schnebly CFA plan; see pages 13–14.
    a. Preservation of Oak Creek
        1. The Oak Creek floodway and riparian habitat shall be permanently protected in its natural state to preserve riparian habitat, maintain storm water functions, minimize flood damage, and serve as an historical focal point of Sedona, and character-defining feature of the area.
        2. Permanent structures shall be located outside the Oak Creek floodway, with only minor improvements allowed within the floodway such as trails, recreation amenities, or temporary structures such as yurts or tents.
    b. Open Space
    Open space shall be a defining feature of the area, protected for its natural resources, wildlife habitat, riparian and scenic values, and rural character, subject to the following standards:
        1. Development shall be clustered to preserve open space, which shall comprise at least 25 percent of the site, and may include hillsides, floodplains, and other features, but shall not include paved areas.
        2. Open space shall be uninterrupted and contiguous with open space and natural areas on adjacent properties.
        3. Drainages flowing into Oak Creek shall be retained unaltered as linear corridors of natural open space.
        4. Hillsides that are identified in the Schnebly CFA Plan as visible from Uptown and Highway 89 shall be preserved as open space to retain scenic views and to minimize erosion.
        5. Uses within open space areas may include:
            i. Park, greenway, trails, and other recreation amenities.
            ii. Orchards, gardens, and other agricultural uses.
(4) Protection from Potential Hazards
All proposed development shall be designed to protect the public from the potential hazards of drainage, debris flow, fire, and erosion. Projects shall be designed with existing features in order to minimize disturbance to, and therefore mitigation of, land surfaces and hillsides.
(5) Relationship to the Public Realm and Adjacent Developments
    a. Development shall respect local development patterns and site features to the maximum extent practicable when such development patterns contribute to a unified visual appearance. Site designs shall respond to local contextual influences and to the design and layout of adjoining developments.
    b. Elements that shall be coordinated between adjacent sites to the maximum extent practicable include:
        1. Shared driveways for accessing adjoining streets;
        2. Linkages of internal vehicular circulation systems;
        3. Linkages of interior pedestrian systems;
        4. Linkages/continuation of open space systems;
        5. Perimeter open space and landscape buffer zones;
        6. Areas and access for refuse collection;
        7. Drainage and detention facilities; and
        8. Linkages of any other networks and/or functional areas where a coordinated site design approach will benefit the cohesiveness of a larger area, such as shared utility easements.
(6) Utilities
    a. All water, sewer, telephone, cable television, electric lines (12 KV or less), and other utilities shall be underground unless an administrative determination is made that physical barriers render undergrounding utilities infeasible. Transformers, pedestals, fire hydrants, and other appurtenances normally associated with “underground” utility installations are permitted on the surface of the ground.
    b. Temporary emergency facilities may be erected and maintained above the surface of the ground for a period of four months. Other temporary aboveground utilities expected to be utilized for a longer period of time may be erected and maintained only after obtaining a temporary use permit for the use being served in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.4.D.
    c. Wherever possible, underground utilities shall be located within or immediately adjacent to the disturbed areas of a lot or parcel (such as driveways and roadways). In any event, all areas disturbed by the installation of the underground utilities shall be revegetated and/or landscaped.
    d. Apparatus needed for the operation of active or passive solar energy systems or other alternate energy systems, including, but not limited to, overhangs, movable insulating walls and roofs, attached or detached solar collectors, reflectors and piping, may be permitted by the Director for any use subject to the specifications set forth by the Director.

E. Building Placement and Orientation
(1) Intent
The intent of these standards is to ensure that buildings are oriented to emphasize public spaces, with entryways clearly visible from key locations, because the location and orientation of individual buildings within the network of streets, pedestrian connections, and open spaces on a site largely establishes the character of a development.
(2) Building Locations (Multi-Building Developments)
Within developments that have three or more buildings, buildings shall be arranged and grouped using one or more of the following techniques:
    a. Frame the corner of an adjacent street intersection or entry point to the development;
    b. Frame and enclose parking areas on at least two sides; or
    c. On sites of five acres or more, frame and enclose a “main street” pedestrian and/or vehicle access corridor within the development.
(3) Building Separation (Commercial and Public/Semi-Public Buildings)
The minimum building separation between adjacent commercial and public/semi-public buildings in multi-building developments shall increase from a minimum of 10 feet to 20 feet, in proportion to the length of the walls adjacent to each other as depicted in Figure 5-11 and in Table 5.6 as follows:
+-----------------------+---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
|                       |                    Minimum Building Separation                     |
+-----------------------+---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| If adjacent building  | 20 feet | 21 – 30 feet | 31 – 40 feet | 41 – 50 feet | 51 feet and |
| length (A) is:        |         |              |              |              | over        |
+-----------------------+---------+--------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| Then minimum building | 10 feet | 12.5 feet    | 15 feet      | 17.5 feet    | 20 feet     |
| separation (B)        |         |              |              |              |             |
| shall be:             |         |              |              |              |             |

F. Building Design
(1) Intent
Building design directly impacts the character and function of new development. The building design standards are intended to:
    a. Ensure that new building design is sensitive to and compatible with the Sedona built and natural environment, which is achieved through compliance with this Code;
    b. Ensure that multi-building or phased developments use compatible schemes of materials, colors, and architectural vocabulary to ensure consistency;
    c. Ensure building materials are durable and have low-maintenance requirements in the semi-arid environment;
    d. Encourage sustainable development by limiting the amount of resources necessary to construct and operate buildings and by designing buildings to be adaptable for multiple uses;
    e. Ensure that buildings are compatible in architectural style and proportionate to elements within the project site, adjacent and neighboring properties, and the area within which they are located.
(2) Building Form
    a. Building Massing
    In order to maximize the integration of the built environment with the natural environment, and to minimize the distractions of the built environment, all new development proposals should incorporate means of reducing the apparent size and bulk of buildings by complying with the standards in this subsection.
        1. Single-Family Residential
            i. All single-family residential buildings and structures shall be composed of multiple visual building masses based on the following requirements:
                a. All single-family residential buildings or structures over 1,000 square feet but under 2,000 square feet in gross floor area shall be composed of at least two visual building masses of differing heights and at least two visual building masses of differing planes.
                b. All single-family residential buildings or structures 2,000 square feet or greater in gross floor area shall be composed of at least three visual building masses of differing heights and at least three visual building masses of differing planes.
            ii. Such visual building masses shall (keyed to Figure 5-12):
                a. Vary in height vertically by a minimum of two feet from any adjacent mass or masses;
                b. Be 100 square feet minimum; and
                c. Have a minimum depth of six feet.
                d. An upper story that is recessed by a minimum depth of six feet shall qualify as a visual building mass.
                e. Depth and width dimensions shall be measured perpendicular to each other.Figure 5-12: Visual Building Mass
    [IMAGE: visual building mass <5-12.png>]
        2. Multifamily Residential
            i. All multifamily residential buildings or structures 2,500 square feet or greater in gross floor area shall be composed of at least three visual building masses of differing heights and planes.
            ii. Such visual building masses shall (keyed to Figure 5-12):
                a. Vary in height vertically by a minimum of two feet from any adjacent mass or masses;
                b. Be 100 square feet minimum; and
                c. Have a minimum depth of six feet.
                d. An upper story that is recessed by a minimum depth of six feet shall qualify as a visual building mass.
                e. Depth and width dimensions shall be measured perpendicular to each other.
            iii. The structures permitted in Section 2.24.D(4), Exceptions to Setback Requirements, shall not be considered as a separate visual building mass for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this subsection.
        3. Commercial and Public/Semi-Public
        All commercial and public/semi-public buildings or structures 2,500 square feet or greater in gross floor area shall be composed of at least three visual building masses of differing heights and planes. (See Figure 5-13.)
            i. Such visual building masses shall vary in height vertically by a minimum of three feet from any adjacent mass or masses.
            ii. In plan and elevation view, the largest single building mass shall contain no more than 60 percent of the total building footprint, and the largest two building masses together shall contain no more than 80 percent of the total building footprint.
            iii. In plan view, each mass shall be offset from adjacent masses with a minimum depth of six feet.
            iv. An upper story that is recessed by a minimum depth of six feet shall qualify as a visual building mass. Depth and width dimensions shall be measured perpendicular to each other.
            v. The structures permitted in Section 2.24.D(4), Exceptions to Setback Requirements, shall not be considered as a separate visual building mass for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this subsection.Figure 5-13: Commercial and Public/Semi-Public Visual Building Mass
        [IMAGE: visual bldg mass commercial <5-13.png>]
    b. Building Proportions and Scale
        1. Vertical Elements
        Taller buildings or portions of a building shall be located internally to a site or structure so that buildings step down in height as they reach the edges of the site or structure.
        2. Height Transitions
            i. A new building that applies alternate standards in the area adjacent to an existing residence (Section 2.24.E(4), Alternate Height Standards) and has a height that exceeds that of an adjacent existing residential building by 10 feet or more shall provide a transition using at least two of the following techniques:
                a. “Stepping down” building height and mass along the shared property line to meet the height of the existing neighboring building along a minimum of 50 percent of the new building’s length. The “stepped-down” portion of the new building shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width and depth. This option is available only where the existing building is located along the property line adjacent to the new building;
                b. Increasing the side yard setback a minimum of five feet beyond that which is required and providing a landscape buffer along the shared property line;
                c. Providing variations in the side building wall and/or roof form so that new structures have a comparable scale as neighboring buildings along the shared property line;
                d. Utilizing a roof pitch and overhang similar to that of the neighboring structures; and
                e. Utilizing dormers and sloping roofs to accommodate upper stories.
            ii. In the Uptown area, where one building abuts another, the new development shall incorporate a minimum of three design elements to show elements of “continuous connection” to neighboring buildings. Elements shall include, but are not limited to, common parapet heights, covered walkway fascias, similar building materials, and similar building forms.
    c. Building Articulation
        1. Horizontal Articulation
            i. Buildings shall be designed to reduce unrelieved planes by dividing façades into a series of smaller components. Each building elevation, regardless of exterior wall plane setback or the location of interior, shall incorporate one or more of the following elements for every 30 feet of elevation:
                a. Menu of Articulation Elements
                    1. Projections, recessions, or reveals such as, but not limited to, columns, pilasters, cornices, and bays, and having a change of wall plane that is a minimum of 24 inches in depth and that has the effect of casting shadows;
                    2. Glazed windows and doors, if used to comply with this standard shall comprise not less than 30 percent of the elevation of which they are a part;
                    3. Change in texture and/or masonry pattern; and/or
                    4. Awnings or canopies extending at least four feet beyond the building face.
                b. Number of Articulation Elements Required
                The number of articulation elements required per each 30 feet of building façade shall be determined by building type, as set forth below:
                    1. Single-family or duplex residential: Not required.
                    2. Multifamily: At least one articulation element required.
                    3. Nonresidential: At least two articulation elements required.
            ii. The Director shall have the authority to waive this requirement when the building is not visible from adjacent properties or the public right-of-way.
        2. Vertical Articulation
        Mixed-use and commercial buildings shall be designed to include a clearly identifiable base, body, and top, with horizontal elements separating these components.
            i. Base
            The building base shall establish a strong connection to the ground and site through the use of any of the following design techniques:
                a. Incorporation of low planters and walls;
                b. Use of base architectural veneer banding or a wainscot, and treatments defined by different materials, textures, or colors. Base colors should typically be darker than upper level colors; and/or
                c. Carefully integrated covered walkways, trellises, or architectural awnings that provide deep shadow at ground level. This has the added advantage of achieving a more articulated building mass.
            ii. Upper Stories
                a. For multiple-story buildings, each upper floor shall have a reduction in floor area of at least 10 percent from the immediately lower floor.
                b. This section does not apply to levels below the ground floor. For purposes of this provision, the “ground floor” shall be the floor with the nearest elevation to the adjoining street.
        3. Unrelieved Building Plane (Commercial and Public/Semi-Public Buildings)
            i. No exterior wall of a building or structure shall have an unrelieved building plane that exceeds 800 square feet in area.
            ii. An unrelieved building plane that exceeds 800 square feet may be approved by the Director or Commission if the wall is located on an interior side or rear property line adjacent to an existing building, or if the wall is being used for a mural or artwork.
            iii. A break or separation between unrelieved building planes is defined as an interruption of the building wall plane with:
                a. A recess or an offset measuring at least three feet in depth and 10 feet in width. The offset angle determining the “break” shall be between 45 degrees and 90 degrees to the wall;
                b. A change of building materials; or
                c. A balcony.
        4. Varied Facades
            i. The spacing of elements in façades shall be varied rather than repetitive, with a high priority placed on the three-dimensional interplay of light and shadow.
            ii. Topographical changes shall be reflected by vertical offsets in the façades of buildings.
        5. Transparency (Windows, Doors, and Openings)
            i. The ground-floor level of each façade facing a public street or other public area such as a plaza, park, or sidewalk shall contain a minimum of 30 percent windows or doorways. Upper floors of each façade facing a public street shall contain a minimum of 15 percent windows. For these requirements, a lesser amount may be allowed if limited by state and/or local energy codes, up to the maximum percentage possible.
            ii. The proportion of solid area to window and door area shall be noted on the elevations.
            iii. “Storefront”-type glass walls shall not extend in a continuous unbroken façade longer than 20 feet.
            iv. Windows shall not be obstructed with permanent or temporary signage except as allowed in Article 6: Signs.
        6. Roofline Variation
        The roofline silhouette of buildings shall be varied in order to reduce the visual impact of line and form contrast with the natural environment. To reduce the visual impact of roof mass, no roofline along any building elevation shall exceed 50 feet in length without a visual variation that incorporates:
            i. Projections, recessions, dormers that alter the vertical or horizontal plane of the roof by at least two feet;
            ii. Change in roof height of at least two feet; or
            iii. Distinct parapet designs and cornice treatments.
    d. Building Length (Multifamily Residential and Lodging Uses)
        1. Any multifamily residential or lodging building that exceeds 150 feet in length shall be limited in height such that a minimum of 25 percent of the building footprint is no more than 16 feet in height. The portion of the building subject to this regulation shall be unbroken and not separated into smaller areas, and shall be visible from both sides of the elevation longer than 150 feet in length.
        2. The maximum length of any multifamily residential or lodging building, regardless of its height, shall be 200 feet measured from one end of the building along its longest elevation to the opposite end inclusive of elevator shafts, interior and exterior stairs, balconies and covered patios, and covered walkways.
(3) Architectural Style and Character
    a. Compatibility
    Buildings shall be designed to be compatible with the predominant architectural design of the community and the surrounding area. If a project is proposed within an area with building design that does not meet this Section 5.7, then the project should propose building design that is consistent with this Section 5.7.
    b. Building Design as Signage
    Building elevations and/or elements used to comply with these standards shall not function as signs. The incorporation of certain design elements that are unique or symbolic of a particular business shall be unobtrusive and secondary to the overall architectural design.
    c. Comprehensive and Unified Design
        1. If a building or center has a primary architectural theme, that theme should be used around the entire building. This can include, but is not limited to, the use of tile accents, stucco designs, awnings, cornice treatments, stepped parapets, trellises or arbors with live plant material, textured materials such as stone or brick, planters, or colored panels.
        2. All building façades facing public streets shall be designed with a similar level of design detail, patterning, and finish. Blank walls void of architectural detailing shall not be permitted. Exceptions may be granted for those areas that the applicant can demonstrate are not visible from adjacent development or public rights-of-way.
        3. Accessory structures shall be designed and finished to complement the principal structure through the use of the same colors, materials, textures, shape, and architectural style.
        4. In a multi-building development:
            i. The architectural design of all buildings (including freestanding outparcel structures) shall be organized around a consistent architectural theme in terms of the character, materials, texture, color, and scale of buildings.
            ii. All buildings in a single development, whether developed at a single time or in phases, shall share at least four architectural features in order to create continuity within the overall development. These features include, but are not limited to, the following:
                a. Overhangs;
                b. Canopies or porticos;
                c. Recesses or projections;
                d. Arcades;
                e. Raised corniced parapets over the entrance;
                f. Roof style and materials;
                g. Arches;
                h. Outdoor patios;
                i. Tower elements (at strategic locations);
                j. Display windows;
                k. Integral planters that incorporate landscaped areas or seating areas; and
                l. Water features.
    d. OC Zoning District Historic Resources
    While some existing structures in the OC District do not exhibit sufficient architectural integrity to meet local landmark criteria, they may nevertheless retain significant architectural features and/or be located in a setting or context that conveys the events of Sedona’s history. Protection of historic resources shall be an important consideration in all development and redevelopment proposals. The following standards shall apply:
        1. When development is proposed on a property that contains a structure that is at least 50 years of age, a Historic Resource Survey shall be completed prior to site development in order to document the resource, determine its historic significance and integrity, and determine the feasibility of its preservation and integration into the new development.
        2. Architectural details shall be designed to include materials and architectural features that reflect the character and cultural history of the area, are simple in design (i.e., without excessive or elaborate ornamentation), and complement the character of adjacent historic resources.
        3. Historic resources shall be reused and incorporated into the overall design of the development to the maximum extent practicable.
(4) Building Materials
    a. Exterior Materials Generally
    With respect to all materials that are used on the exterior of a structure, the following apply:
        1. Mirrored or reflective surfaces or any treatments that change transparent or semi-transparent windows into mirrored surfaces are prohibited. Tinted glass is acceptable.
        2. Metallic surfaces shall be treated to reduce reflections.
    b. Prohibited Exterior Finishes
        1. Unless allowed under subsection F(4)b.2 below, the following materials are prohibited as exterior finishes:
            i. Cedar or other wood shakes;
            ii. Faux rock – simulated cement or similar rock products, i.e., “cultured stones”;
            iii. Highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials;
            iv. Exposed unfinished foundation walls;
            v. Exposed plywood or particleboard;
            vi. Glass curtain walls;
            vii. White, brightly colored, or reflective roofs;
            viii. Unfinished, exposed standard CMUs;
            ix. White exterior surfaces on skylights;
            x. Shiny acrylic or similar paint finishes on stucco.
        2. The use of a building material otherwise prohibited by this subsection may be allowed by the Director on a case-by-case basis if the Director finds that:
            i. The use of the proposed material complies with the intent of this Code and other applicable City codes; and
            ii. The proposed material is compatible in terms of general appearance, quality and durability, architectural style, design, color, and texture; and
            iii. The material aids in the prevention of fires or provides some other community benefit, such as reclaimed or re-purposed materials.
(5) Building Color
    a. Intent
    The color contrast of structures with the natural dark green of the vegetation, and rust reds of the red rocks and soils, is a concern with respect to reducing visual impacts of the built environment and trying to blend it with the natural environment. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that structures, walls, garage doors, roofs, fences, or other large exposed surface areas blend with the surrounding natural environment without calling undue attention to the development.
    b. Requirements
        1. Hue
            i. Exterior building materials and colors shall match or enhance the tone of the surrounding landscape to the maximum extent practicable.
            ii. Exceptions may be allowed by the Director on a case-by-case basis for railings and other building appurtenances.
        2. Light Reflectance Value and Chroma
            i. Materials and colors used shall not exceed the following light reflectance values (LRV) and Munsell values:
            +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+
            |            Building Size             |      Maximum LRV /      |
            |                                      | (Maximum Munsell Value) |
            +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+
            | Less than 5,000 square feet          | 38 percent / (7)        |
            +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+
            | Between 5,000 square feet and 20,000 | 28 percent / (6)        |
            | square feet                          |                         |
            +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+
            | Greater than 20,000 square feet      | 20 percent / (5)        |
            +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+
            ii. For all colors, the maximum chroma permitted is 2, with the following exceptions:
                a. If a color with a Munsell value of 6 (LRV 28 percent) is proposed, the chroma may be increased to 4.
                b. If a color with a Munsell value of 5 (LRV 20 percent) is proposed, the chroma may be increased to 6.
            iii. Gutters, downspouts, railings, posts and poles, and garage doors shall meet the color requirements for the primary structure.
            iv. Window and door trim and other similar trim may exceed the allowable LRV for the primary structure by 10 percent (for example, if the primary structure is allowed an LRV of 38 percent, trim would be allowed an LRV of 48 percent) and the allowable chroma for the primary structure by 2.
            v. Unpainted shiny metallic surfaces are prohibited.
    c. Evaluation of Color
    The applicant shall submit with any development application a color sample with an assigned LRV and chroma value for every color used on the subject buildings or structures. Materials without assigned LRV and/or chroma values may be accepted by the Director if such materials can be adequately compared to the Munsell templates available in the office of the Director.
    d. Alternate Standards
    Alternate standards may be approved pursuant to Section 2.24.E(4), Alternate Height Standards.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

5.8. Exterior Lighting

A. Purpose

    b. All signs erected or maintained shall conform at all times to the approved Master Sign Plan. Any deviations from an approved Master Sign Plan shall be unlawful unless and until a revised Master Sign Plan is approved.
    c. For developments covering multiple properties, the property owner(s) may elect to have the entire development considered a uniﬁed development site for the purposes of the Master Sign Plan.
(2) Master Sign Plan Requirements
    a. Contents
    A Master Sign Plan shall set forth a master plan for all signage for an entire parcel or development site and include the following information:
        1. Sign dimensions and approximate locations;
        2. Materials and colors;
        3. Proposed illumination, including illumination levels;
        4. Maximum numbers of items of information per sign face;
        5. A design theme with illustrative examples of each sign type and the proposed general locations of each sign type;
        6. A demonstration that the Master Sign Plan will improve the aesthetics of the development and will not have an adverse impact on the use, enjoyment, or value of property in adjacent or nearby residential districts; and
        7. Any other maps, drawings or materials as required by the Director (including a colored rendering of the sign) to adequately describe the sign proposal. The application and any exhibits shall become the property of the City.
    b. Prohibited Signs and Sign Elements
    Prohibited signs and sign elements are not eligible for inclusion in a Master Sign Plan unless speciﬁcally indicated in this article.
    c. Architectural Theme
    All signs shall be architecturally integrated into or complimentary to the design of the building(s) and character of the site, and shall use similar and coordinated design features, materials, and colors. The Master Sign Plan shall establish an integrated architectural vocabulary and cohesive theme for the development site.
    d. Community Character
    The signage proposed in a Master Sign Plan shall not have an adverse impact on the community character of the district in which the development site is located, or of the City of Sedona.
    e. Nonconforming Signs

        1. The height, area, number, and location of signs permitted through the Master Sign Plan shall be determined based on the following criteria:
            i. The overall size of the development site and the scale of the use or uses located or anticipated to be located there (larger land areas and scales of use tend to favor larger signs and/or more signs);
            ii. Relationship between the building setback and sign location (additional signage may be appropriate for buildings with less visibility, particularly where buffering is providing an aesthetic and/or environmental beneﬁt to the City);
            iii. Length of frontage on a public right-of-way (larger frontages may justify more or larger signs, particularly if the size of the frontage tends to prevent sign clutter from multiple adjacent parcels);
            iv. Classiﬁcation of street the development site fronts on (frontage along an arterial or collector street may justify more or larger signs than frontage along a local street);
            v. Access and visibility to the site;
            vi. Intended traffic circulation pattern and the need for wayﬁnding;
            vii. Hierarchy of signage;
            viii. Relationship between the site and adjacent uses;
            ix. The desired function of the site; and
            x. Consistency with the objectives and design policies of the Community Plan and any applicable Community Focus Area plans.
    c. Lighting
    Lighting standards shall not deviate from the standards of this article.
(4) Master Sign Plan Review
    a. Generally
    Master Sign Plans for new construction or redevelopment shall be reviewed as part of the development review process as set forth in Section 8.4.A, Development Review.

Where signage is to be placed on or associated with a designated historic landmark, the design, graphics and materials of such signage shall be consistent with the historic character and context of the structure or site and be in compliance with the landmark approval.

G. Location
(1) No signs shall be placed on or about public property or within any public right-of-way, unless otherwise permitted. Such signs may be deemed refuse and subject to removal by the Director.
(2) No sign or sign structure shall be erected in such a manner that any portion of its surface or supports will interfere with free use of all ﬁre appliances, including hydrants, standpipes, automatic ﬁre sprinkler connections, and the like. Fire lanes shall not be obstructed by the placement of any sign or sign structure.
(3) No sign shall obstruct any window to such an extent that any light or ventilation is reduced to a point below that required by any law or ordinance.

H. Maintenance
(1) All signs shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. The display surfaces of all signs shall be kept neatly painted or posted at all times.
(2) Any sign determined by the Director to be a hazard to safety, health, or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or electrical shall be remedied immediately.

The City Engineer may approve a sign within the traffic visibility triangle if it can be demonstrated that it does not impact traffic safety.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

6.6. Sign Measurements and Calculations

A. Sign Area
(1) Sign area is calculated as the area within a continuous perimeter with up to eight straight sides that encloses the limits of text and graphics of a sign, together with any frame or other material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign’s message from the background against which it is placed. (See Figure 6-1, Figure 6-2, and Figure 6-3.) The area excludes the structure upon which the sign is placed (unless the structure is an integral part of the display or used to differentiate it), but includes any open space contained within the outer limits of the display face of a sign, or between any component, panel, strip, or ﬁgure of any kind composing the display face, whether this open space is enclosed by a frame or border or not.
(2) Support structures will not be counted against total sign area as long as such elements are appropriately scaled to the size of the copy as determined by the Director.Figure 6-1: Building Sign Area
[IMAGE: sign area building <6-1.png>]Figure 6-2: Monument Sign Area
[IMAGE: sign area monument <6-2.png>]Figure 6-3: Projected Sign Area
[IMAGE: sign area projected <6-3.png>]

B. Sign Height
(1) Sign height is measured as the vertical distance from the average elevation of the ﬁnish grade within a six-foot radius at the base of the sign to the top of the sign, including all backgrounds and support structures, exclusive of any ﬁlling, berming, mounding, or landscaping, solely done for the purpose of locating the sign.
(2) If natural grade at the base of a sign is lower than the grade of an adjacent road, the height of the sign may be measured from the top of curb elevation. (See Figure 6-4.)Figure 6-4: Sign Height
[IMAGE: sign height <6-4.png>]

C. Items of Information
An item of information is a word, logo, abbreviation, symbol, geometric shape, image, or number with 10 or fewer digits (punctuation of numbers does not increase the number of items of information).
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

6.7. Design Standards Applicable to All Signs
This section provides minimum design guidance for all signs, regardless of speciﬁc type or location. These guidelines address issues related to sign legibility, placement, color, materials, and illumination. These guidelines are intended to ensure business owners install quality signs that add to and support the character and unique beauty of Sedona. Following these standards from the onset of a project will help to ensure that the signs are designed as an integral element of the building design architecture and not as an afterthought.

A. Sign Legibility
In the interest of public safety, the following standards are meant to ensure that signs have adequate visibility and legibility. Deviations may be permitted through approval of a Master Sign Plan if it can be shown that the proposed deviation will not have a negative impact on visibility and legibility of the sign.
(1) Signs 15 Square Feet or Less
    a. Maximum of seven items of information;
    b. Maximum of two font styles.
(2) Signs over 15 Square Feet (See Figure 6-5)
    a. Maximum of 12 items of information;
    b. Maximum of three font styles.Figure 6-5: Sign Legibility
    [IMAGE: sign legibility <6-5.png>]
(3) Items of Information (see Section 6.6, Sign Measurements and Calculations)
A brief message should be used whenever possible. A sign with a brief, succinct message is simpler and faster to read, looks cleaner, and is generally more attractive.
(4) Font Styles
    a. An effective sign should do more than attract attention; it should communicate its message clearly. This is directly related to the readability of words and phrases. The most signiﬁcant inﬂuence on legibility is lettering style and spacing. Typefaces that are difficult to read reduce the sign’s ability to communicate. Crowding letters, words, or lines will make any sign more difficult to read. Conversely, over-spacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually, again obscuring the message.
    b. Signs should use letters on a contrasting background.
    c. There should be an adequate amount of contrast between the colors to increase legibility. If there is little contrast between the brightness or hue of the message of a sign and its background, it will be difficult to read.

B. Sign Placement
In order to assist in wayﬁnding, signs throughout a development site should be placed in a strategic manner, in similar locations and in a similar fashion throughout the center so that customers can easily identify business locations.
(1) Wayﬁnding signs for businesses shall be placed at or near the public entrance or main parking area to indicate the most direct access to the business.
(2) Signs shall be placed consistent with the proportions of the building’s façade. For example, a particular sign may ﬁt well on an upper, more basic wall, but would overpower and obstruct the ﬁner detail of a lower storefront area.
(3) Signs shall not be located so that they cover or interrupt the architectural details or ornamentation of a building’s façade.
(4) Signs shall not be mounted higher than the eave line or top of the parapet wall of the building and no portions of the sign shall extend beyond the ends of the wall to which it is attached.
(5) The location and extent of signs and advertising should not obstruct scenic views.
(6) Repetitious signage information on the same building frontage should be avoided.

C. Sign Color
The City of Sedona has long placed a strong emphasis on building design and aesthetics, including regulations of color to ensure the built environment blends into the surrounding natural environment. In order to ensure the signs adhere to this same standard, sign colors are regulated in a similar way to building colors.
(1) Sign colors shall provide sufficient contrast to be legible, yet be subdued enough to blend with the natural landscape and/or surrounding structures.
(2) Background colors shall be limited to no more than three on a single sign. Too many colors overwhelm the viewer’s ability to process fast what the sign is communicating. Limit use of accent colors to increase legibility.
(3) The background area of a sign, exclusive of any letters, words, or symbols, shall comply with the exterior color requirements of Section 5.7.F(5), Building Color, except as noted below.
    a. Not more than 10 percent of the sign background area shall exceed these color requirements.
    b. Natural materials including, but not limited to, rock, natural wood, tile, and brick, which do not comply with these color requirements, may be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Director.
(4) Text colors are not subject to the same color restrictions as background colors, but should provide sufficient contrast. Bright and glossy or ﬂuorescent colors and reﬂective surfaces are prohibited.
(5) Sign colors shall relate to and complement the materials or color scheme of the buildings, including accent and trim colors.
(6) Signs may be painted directly on building façades. The Director shall review such requests on a case-by-case basis and make a determination based on a review of whether the proposed sign interferes with the architectural integrity of the building.

D. Sign Materials
(1) Materials shall be selected with consideration for the architectural design of the building’s façade. Sign materials shall complement the architecture and materials of the structure.
(2) Acceptable sign materials include:
    a. Wood (carved, sandblasted, etched, sealed and painted, or stained).
    b. Red rock and river rock.
    c. Tile (painted, sealed, inlaid tiles).
    d. Metal, including rusted metal (formed, etched, cast, engraved, primed or factory coated).
    e. Stucco, when used to match an existing building on site.
    f. High density sign foam, when designed to successfully imitate another acceptable sign material.
    g. Decorative iron or wood brackets are preferred for sign hardware support.
    h. Requests to use alternative materials may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Director.
(3) Signs with Relief
    a. Signs with relief are encouraged but not required.
    b. The total base sign area may increase by 20 percent when a minimum of 50 percent of the total copy area incorporates three-dimensional relief. (See Figure 6-6.)Figure 6-6: Signs with Relief
[IMAGE: signs with relief <6-6.png>]

E. Sign Illumination
Sign illumination is necessary to ensure businesses can be found when open after dark. However, as a Dark Sky Community, Sedona seeks to limit outdoor lighting to only what is necessary and to minimize light pollution. The following illumination standards seek to achieve a balance between providing sufficient sign lighting while ensuring maintenance of the dark skies.
(1) Illumination is only permitted on permanent signs in commercial districts. Temporary signs and signs in residential districts cannot be illuminated, unless approved as a part of a Master Sign Plan.
(2) The intensity of sign lighting shall not exceed that necessary to illuminate and make legible a sign from the adjacent travel way or closest right-of-way; and the illumination of a sign shall not be obtrusive to the surrounding area as determined by the Director.
(3) Signs should only be illuminated if the existing ambient light (such as from street lights or from interior lighting from a building) is not sufficient to light the sign.
(4) When illumination is used, the light shall be contained to the sign and no light shall spill over.
(5) Illumination for signs shall conform to all provisions of Section 5.8, Exterior Lighting. Sign lighting shall be treated as Class 1 lighting and shall conform to the lamp, shielding, and time restrictions and shall count towards the lumen cap for the property.
(6) Sign illumination shall be limited to a maximum of two different colors.
(7) External Illumination
    a. Fixtures chosen for external illumination shall be architecturally compatible with the building to which they are attached.
    b. Externally lit signs shall be illuminated only with steady, stationary, shielded light sources directed solely onto the sign without causing glare. (See Figure 6-7.)Figure 6-7: Externally Lit Building Sign
    [IMAGE: gooseneck lights <6-7.png>]
    c. External lighting ﬁxtures shall be fully shielded and directed down.
    d. Ground mounted uplighting may be used when it can be demonstrated that no light will spill off of the sign face. (See Figure 6-8.)Figure 6-8: Ground Mounted Uplighting of Monument Sign
    [IMAGE: ground mounted lights <6-8.png>]
(8) Internal Illumination
Internally illuminated signs are prohibited except as permitted below:
    a. Individual halo-lit letters with solid opaque faces that do not permit any light to come through the face and that are silhouetted against a softly illuminated wall. (See Figure 6-9.)Figure 6-9: Individual Halo-Lit Letters with Opaque Face
    [IMAGE: individual halo-lit letters <6-9.png>]
    b. Metal-faced box signs with cut-out letters and soft-glow lighting sources. (See Figure 6-10.)Figure 6-10: Opaque Face with Soft Glow Letters
    [IMAGE: opaque face with soft glow letters <6-10.png>]
(9) Prohibited Illumination Methods
    a. Light bulbs or lighting tubes used for illuminating a sign shall not be visible from adjacent public rights-of-way or residential properties.
    b. The ﬁxtures used to illuminate signs shall not be directed toward nearby residential properties.
    c. Other than one sign per business, with a maximum of two square feet, digital or electronically lit messages of any kind, or signs having the same effect, are prohibited.
    d. Blinking, rotating, ﬂashing, hanging, or reﬂecting lights are prohibited.
    e. Visible raceways and transformers for individual letters are prohibited.

        4. Electronic or LED monitors (such as TV screens) shall not be used as window signs.

C. Site Signs
(1) Site signs are permitted for each individual parcel or group of parcels that the owners have declared to be a development site for sign purposes. Sign area accumulates for the parcel or development site, regardless of the number of businesses on that parcel.
(2) The following signs are considered site signs, are allotted per property, and shall not count against the total allowable signage for any one business. These signs are permitted at the discretion of the property owner and/or property management company.
    a. Monument (Freestanding) Signs
        1. There shall be no more than one monument sign per street frontage per site and a maximum of two monument signs per site.Figure 6-15: Monument Sign

(1) Generally
Development of lands that are subject to periodic inundation, subsidence of the earth’s surface, high water table, or have difficult topography, unstable soils, or other natural or manmade hazards to life or property shall be avoided to the maximum extent practicable, unless it can be substantiated that:
    a. The proposed lot configurations and sizes, grading and drainage techniques or other special development approaches are reasonable and necessary to protect the public health, safety, or general welfare on any lands to be subdivided that are impacted by these characteristics.
    b. The sensitive lands are protected through a cluster subdivision, pursuant to Section 7.3.J(2), Cluster Subdivision.
    c. The Council may approve subdivision of such land upon receipt of evidence from the City Engineer, the County Flood Control Districts, State and County Health Authorities, and other area Emergency Services Authorities that the construction of specific improvements can be expected to render the land suitable. Construction upon such land shall be prohibited until specified improvements have been planned and construction guaranteed.
(2) Steep Slope and Ridgeline Development
    a. Lot lines and streets shall be located on or near the crest of ridges or hilltops to preclude prominent line of sight building construction. Building pads shall not be located on or near the crest of ridge lines; and

    d. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. Where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets shall be not less than required by the Engineering Standards Manual.
    e. The street pattern shall not cause adjacent property to be landlocked nor prevent access to public land.
(3) Street Intersections
    a. Streets shall be arranged in relation to existing topography to produce streets of reasonable gradient to facilitate adequate drainage and to produce desirable lots of maximum utility.
    b. Where a subdivision abuts or contains the right-of-way of a drainage way, a limited access highway or an irrigation ditch or abuts a commercial or industrial land use, the Director may require the location of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of this right-of-way at a distance suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land. This distance shall be determined with due regard for approach grades, drainage, bridges or future grade separations.
(4) Street Design Standards
    a. Streets shall be related appropriately to the expected use of the property. Minimum requirements for street right-of-way, pavement width, and other standards for public and private streets are set forth in the Engineering Standards Manual.
    b. Other designs and materials may be required for the construction of streets, curbs, and sidewalks when, in the determination of the City Engineer, such methods would be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the design of the development or neighborhood.
    c. Turnarounds shall be provided at the ends of cul-de-sacs and at elbows on one-way streets. Turnarounds shall meet the minimum requirements of the Sedona Fire District.
(5) Sidewalks
Unless otherwise provided in this Code, sidewalks shall be provided by the developer and installed on both sides of all arterials, collector streets, and local streets (including loop lanes and cul-de-sacs), and within and along the frontage of all new development. Also see Section 5.4.H, Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation.

G. Street Naming and Traffic Control Signs
(1) Continuation of Existing Names
The subdivider shall indicate the street name for public streets on the preliminary plat by projecting existing north-south and east-west street names that fall in alignment. Where no current streets are in alignment, the subdivider may propose a name subject to final approval by the City Engineer and City Council.
(2) Street Signage
    a. All streets in a subdivision shall be named and identified by signs installed at every street intersection.
    b. These signs shall be standard street signs as indicated in the current edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
    c. All traffic control signs, as well as street name signs, required in a subdivision shall be provided and installed by the City at the expense of the subdivider in conformance with the current edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and any relevant Arizona state supplements.

8.3. Common Review Procedures

A. General
This section describes the standard procedures and rules applicable to all development applications unless otherwise stated in this Code. Common review procedures include seven steps, as shown below in Figure 8-1, Common Review Procedures, not all of which are applicable to every development application. Application-specific procedures in Sections 8.4 through 8.8 identify additional procedures and rules beyond those in this section.Figure 8-1: Common Review Procedures
[IMAGE: <Figure8-1.png>]

B. Pre-Application Meeting
(1) Purpose
The pre-application meeting is intended to provide an opportunity for the applicant to meet with City staff to review applicable submittal requirements and review procedures associated with the proposed development concept.
(2) When Required
A pre-application meeting is required according to Table 8.1, Summary Table of Review Procedures.
(3) Procedure
    a. Request
    The applicant shall submit a request for a pre-application meeting to the Director.
    b. Scheduling
    The Director shall schedule pre-application meetings and notify appropriate staff and the applicant of the time and location of the meeting.
(4) Effect
Any information or discussions held at the pre-application meeting shall not be binding on the City or the applicant. Discussions of potential conditions to mitigate impacts do not reflect actions by the decision-making body until and unless a decision-making body takes formal action to attach that condition to a development approval.
(5) Preliminary Conceptual Review
Depending on the size and scale of the development proposal, the Director may recommend or require, or the applicant may request, a preliminary conceptual review hearing with the Planning and Zoning Commission. Such hearing shall be scheduled as a public hearing before the Commission and shall be noticed in accordance with Section 8.3.F, Scheduling and Notice of Public Hearings.

C. Application Submittal and Handling
(1) Authority to Submit Application
    a. Unless expressly stated otherwise in this Code, a development application shall be submitted by:
        1. The owner, contract purchaser, or any other person having a recognized property interest in the land on which development is proposed; or
        2. A person authorized to submit the application on behalf of the owner, contract purchaser, or other person having a recognized property interest in the land, as evidenced by a letter or document signed by the owner, contract purchaser, or other person.
    b. If there are multiple owners, contract purchasers, or other persons authorized to submit the application, all such persons shall sign the application or a letter or document consenting to the application.
    c. No application shall be submitted prior to attending a pre-application meeting, if required per Table 8.1, Summary Table of Review Procedures.
    d. Applications will not be accepted from property owners/applicants who are:
        1. In violation of, or not in compliance with, either this Code, Sedona City Code or Arizona Revised Statutes, unless, through the application and permitting process, the owner/applicant attempts to resolve any and all violations or compliance issues or is part of a plan of action, accepted by the Director, to do so; or
        2. Have been determined by the City to owe delinquent transaction privilege taxes or any other delinquent fees payable to the City pursuant to this Code or City Code, unless the owner/applicant has entered into a written payment agreement approved by the City relating to payment of any and all outstanding obligations and is current in making any and all payments under the terms of such an agreement.
(2) Application Content
    a. The application shall be submitted to the Director on a form established by the Director. The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating compliance with application requirements.
    b. Some of the requirements listed below will not apply to a given proposal or piece of property; in those instances, the Director may waive those requirements.
    c. The information requested by this Code, and as required by other applicable codes and ordinances, may be combined into one or more maps or plans; provided, that the combined maps or plans adequately and legibly depict the required information.
    d. If required information has previously been submitted to the City and formed the basis of an approved development project, the same information need not be submitted again (for example, an applicant for a single-family residential building permit is not required to submit information previously submitted in conjunction with the subdivision plat approval).
    e. After approval of any development plan, any change to the approved plan shall be resubmitted for a new approval prior to proceeding with the changed portion of the development plan.
(3) Waivers of Submittal Requirements
The Director may waive certain submittal requirements in order to reduce the burden on the applicant and to tailor the requirements to the information necessary to review a particular application. The Director may waive such requirements upon finding that the projected size, complexity, anticipated impacts, or other factors associated with the proposed development clearly, in his or her opinion, support such waiver.
(4) Application Fees
    a. Application fees shall be paid at the time of submittal according to the type of application on the development review fee schedule. The fee schedule shall be established by resolution of the City Council and reviewed periodically.
    b. In the event the Director determines that it is necessary to utilize the services of a consultant not on staff, the Director may impose additional fees associated with such outside consultant. The Director shall inform the applicant of the necessity to utilize the services of a consultant and the applicant may choose whether or not to proceed with the application.
(5) Application Review Timeline
The Director shall establish a review timeline for development applications and shall include that information in the Administrative Manual. The Director may amend the timeline to ensure effective and efficient review under this Code.
(6) Determination of Application Completeness
The Director shall determine whether the application is complete or incomplete within five business days of submittal. A complete application shall be processed according to the procedures in this article. An incomplete application shall not be processed or reviewed. Any deficiencies noted by the Director shall be addressed by the applicant prior to resubmitting the application.
(7) Abandoned Applications
If an application has not been resubmitted to address staff-noted deficiencies within three months, such application shall be deemed abandoned and all fees forfeited. The applicant may request three additional months to address staff-noted deficiencies. Abandoned applications shall require a new pre-application meeting and may be subject to additional fees.
(8) Minor Application Revisions
An applicant may revise an application after receiving notice of compliance deficiencies following staff review, or on requesting and receiving permission from an advisory or decision-making body after that body has reviewed, but not yet taken action on, the application. Revisions shall be limited to changes that directly respond to specific requests or suggestions made by staff or the advisory or decision-making body, as long as they constitute only minor additions, deletions, or corrections and do not include significant substantive changes to the development proposed in the application, as determined by the Director. All other application revisions shall be processed as a new application.
(9) Application Withdrawal
    a. After an application has been accepted, the applicant may withdraw the application at any time by submitting a letter of withdrawal to the Director.
    b. An applicant is not entitled to a refund of application fees for withdrawn applications. However, the Director may refund fees not expended during the first round of staff review if the application is withdrawn prior to preparation of any official written comments.
(10) Concurrent Review
    a. Where possible without creating an undue administrative burden on the City’s decision-making bodies and staff, this Code intends to accommodate the simultaneous processing of applications for different permits and approvals that may be required for the same development project in order to expedite the overall review process.
    b. Review and decision-making bodies considering applications submitted simultaneously shall render separate recommendations and decisions on each application based on the specific standards applicable to each approval.
    c. Examples of concurrent filing and processing of applications include, but are not limited to:
        1. Development review and conditional use permit;
        2. Development review and rezoning;
        3. Conditional use permit and rezoning; and
        4. Rezoning and subdivision.
    d. Some forms of approval depend on the applicant having previously received another form of approval, or require the applicant to take particular action within some time period following the approval in order to avoid having the approval lapse. Therefore, even though this Code intends to accommodate simultaneous processing, applicants should note that each of the permits and approvals set forth in this Code has its own timing and review sequence, and so as a result, concurrent filings are not guaranteed to expedite the respective timing and review sequences of any particular permit or approval herein.

D. Citizen Review Process
(1) Purpose
The citizen review process is intended to:
    a. Ensure that applicants pursue early and effective citizen participation in conjunction with their applications, giving them opportunity to understand and try to mitigate any real or perceived impacts their application may have on the community;
    b. Ensure that citizens and property owners within the community have an adequate opportunity to learn about applications that may affect them and to work with applicants to resolve concerns at an early stage of the process; and
    c. Facilitate ongoing communication between the applicant, interested citizens, and property owners throughout the application review process.
The citizen review process does not pertain to a specific review body or committee. It is not intended to produce complete consensus on all applications, but to encourage applicants to be good neighbors and to allow for informed decision-making.
(2) Applicability
    a. Every applicant who is proposing a project that requires a public hearing, except for those application types listed in subsection 8.3.D(2)b below, shall prepare a citizen participation plan following the pre-application meeting and submission of the application. Implementation of the plan shall begin upon submittal of the application.
    b. A Citizen Participation Plan shall not be required for an application for a variance, Certificate of Appropriateness, appeal, minor conditional use permit (except those associated with a development review), or extension of time for an existing approval.
(3) Target Area
The level of citizen interest and area of involvement will vary depending on the nature of the application and the location of the site. At a minimum, the target area shall include the following:
    a. Property owners within the public hearing notice area required by other sections of this Code;
    b. The head of any homeowners association, or community/neighborhood appointed representative adjoining the project site; and
    c. Other interested parties who have requested that they be placed on the notification list for a particular project.
    d. The Director may determine that additional notices or areas should be provided.
(4) Citizen Participation Plan
At a minimum, the Citizen Participation Plan shall include:
    a. How those interested in and potentially affected by an application will be notified that an application has been submitted;
    b. How those interested and potentially affected parties will be informed of the substance of the change, amendment, or development proposed by the application;
    c. How those affected or otherwise interested will be provided an opportunity to discuss the applicant’s proposal with the applicant and express any concerns, issues or problems they may have with the proposal in advance of the public hearing;
    d. The applicant’s schedule for completion of the Citizen Participation Report; and
    e. How the applicant will keep the Community Development Department informed on the status of their citizen participation efforts.
(5) Public Notice
These requirements are in addition to public notice provisions required by Section 8.3.F, Scheduling and Notice of Public Hearings.
(6) Additional Meetings
The Director may require the applicant to hold additional citizen participation meetings based on:
    a. The length of time between the last citizen participation meeting and the date of the submittal of the application;
    b. The extent of changes that have occurred to the development proposal since the last citizen participation meeting was held; and/or
    c. The length of time between last public hearing (such as a conceptual review hearing) and the date of submittal for further development application consideration.
(7) Citizen Participation Report
The applicant shall provide a written report to the Director and the Planning and Zoning Commission on the results of their citizen participation effort (prior to the notice of public hearing). The Citizen Participation Report shall include the information specified in the Administrative Manual.

E. Staff Review and Action
(1) Referral to Staff and Review Agencies
The Director shall distribute the complete application to appropriate staff and appropriate review agencies, per the Administrative Manual.
(2) Staff Review and Application Revisions
Staff shall review the application and shall consult with applicable City departments and participating reviewing agencies with jurisdiction over public health and safety. Staff shall submit recommendations and comments to the applicant in a form established by the Director. The applicant shall attend a meeting with the appropriate staff as determined by the Director to discuss staff recommendations and comments. The application will not move forward for further review until the Director determines that the applicant has adequately responded to the City’s recommendations and comments, or the applicant requests that the application move forward without responding to the City’s recommendations and comments.
(3) Applications Subject to Staff Recommendation
    a. Staff Report
    If an application is subject to staff review and recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or City Council per Table 8.1, Summary Table of Review Procedures, staff shall prepare a written staff report that summarizes the proposal, findings, and recommendations.
    b. Distribution and Availability of Application and Staff Report
    The Director shall submit a copy of the staff report to the applicant and the advisory and/or decision-making body, and shall make the staff report and related materials available for public review at least seven calendar days prior to the hearing at which the application is scheduled to be heard.
(4) Applications Subject to Staff Decision
    a. If an application is subject to staff review and a final decision by the Director, the Director shall make a decision based on the review standards applicable to the application type. The decision shall be in writing and shall clearly state reasons for a denial or conditions of approval.
    b. Appeals of administrative decisions may be made pursuant to Section 8.8.D, Appeal.
(5) Approval Criteria Applicable to all Applications
    a. Generally
        1. Unless otherwise specified in this Code, City review and decision-making bodies shall review all development applications submitted pursuant to this article for compliance with the general review criteria stated below.
        2. The application may also be subject to additional review criteria specific to the type of application, as set forth in Sections 8.4 through 8.8.
        3. If there is a conflict between the general review criteria in this section and the specific review criteria in Sections 8.4 through 8.8, the applicable review criteria in Sections 8.4 through 8.8 control.
    b. Prior Approvals

8.6. Ordinance Amendments

A. Rezoning (Zoning Map Amendment)
(1) Purpose
    a. The purpose of the rezoning procedure is to make amendments to the Official Zoning Map of the City of Sedona to reflect changes in public policy, adopted plans, or changed conditions. The zoning classification of any parcel in the City may be amended using this procedure. The purpose is neither to relieve particular hardships nor to confer special privileges or rights on any person. Rezonings should not be used when a conditional use permit, variance, or minor modification could be used to achieve a similar result.
    b. Changes to the characteristics of zoning districts (such as setback requirements) and development standards (such as parking requirements) shall be processed as Code text amendments pursuant to Section 8.6.C, Code Text Amendment.
(2) Applicability
Pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-462.01, the provisions of the Zoning Map may periodically be amended or repealed.
    a. Rezonings Generally
    The application submittal and review procedure for rezonings, excluding those to a historic district or to a planned development district, is set forth in Section 8.6.A(3) below.
    b. Rezoning to a Historic District
    The application and review process for a rezoning to a historic district shall be the same as for general rezonings as set forth in this Section 8.6.A, Rezoning (Zoning Map Amendment), with modifications as set forth in Section 8.7.C, Historic District Designation.
    c. Rezoning to a Planned Development District
    The application and review process for a rezoning to a planned development district is in Section 8.6.B, Rezoning to Planned Development District.
    d. Lodging Density Rezoning
    A lodging density rezoning is required for any request to increase the number of lodging units in excess of the number allowed by right in a Lodging District or by an approved development agreement. The application and review process for a lodging density rezoning shall be the same as for general rezonings as set forth in this Section 8.6.A, Rezoning (Zoning Map Amendment), including the criteria applicable for conditional rezoning approval.
    e. Conditional Rezoning Approval
    In order to mitigate the negative impact of the applicant’s proposed use on the citizens of Sedona and surrounding properties and to ensure compatibility with adjacent land uses, the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the Council may approve a rezoning conditioned upon one or more of the following:
        1. Development in accordance with a specific schedule for the development of specific improvements or uses for which zoning is requested;
        2. Development in accordance with a specific site plan or a site plan to be subsequently approved under this Code;
        3. Modifications in the otherwise applicable floor area ratio, lot coverage, building height, or density;
        4. Public dedication of rights-of-way for streets, alleys, public ways, drainage, public utilities and the installation of improvements that are reasonably required by or directly related to the effect of the rezoning; and/or
        5. Other conditions reasonably calculated to mitigate the impact of the proposed development.

        In reviewing a proposed rezoning, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider whether:
            i. The rezoning is consistent with and conforms to the Sedona Community Plan, Community Focus Area Plans, other adopted plans, and the purposes of this Code;
            ii. The rezoning is consistent with and conforms to the purpose statement of the proposed zoning district;
            iii. Substantial changes in the subject area warrant a zoning change; and/or
            iv. The intensity of development in the new zoning district is not expected to create significantly adverse impacts to surrounding properties or the neighborhood.
        4. Legal Protest
        Legal protests of a rezoning shall follow the procedures in A.R.S. § 9-462.04(H).
    g. Post-Decision Actions and Limitations
        1. Processing of Conditional Rezonings
            i. When a rezoning is subject to condition(s), the official Zoning Map shall include a notation that the zoning is conditional and the number of the rezoning application file where the conditions are set forth.
            ii. Any condition imposed by the City Council shall be set forth in the ordinance changing the zoning district classification.
            iii. Any proposed revisions or changes to an approved conditional rezoning application shall be submitted in the same manner and subject to the same approval process as the original application.

B. Rezoning to Planned Development District
(1) Purpose
The zoning classification of any parcel may be changed to a Planned Development (PD) district pursuant to this subsection. The purpose of a rezoning to a PD is to achieve greater flexibility than allowed by the strict application of the Code while providing greater benefit to the City and to ensure efficient provision of services and utilities. The PD procedure shall not be used when a conditional use permit, variance, minor modification, or rezoning to an existing base zoning district could achieve a similar result.
(2) Applicability
    a. The approval of a PD constitutes a zoning district amendment and is established by rezoning an area in an existing zone district to PD zoning, or by initial zoning of newly annexed territory to PD zoning. The approved PD establishes the location and character of the uses and the unified development of the tract(s).
    b. An application to rezone to a PD district may be submitted for any contiguous area of one acre or more within any combination of zoning districts. A PD may be initiated by anyone owning at least 50 percent of the land within the area affected by the proposed PD.
(3) Application Submittal and Review Procedure

            i. The Commission shall consider and make findings for removal of landmark status and removal from the City of Sedona’s Historic Resource Register. The removal of any designated historic resource shall be granted only if the Commission finds that the historic resource no longer conforms to any of the criteria as set forth in Section 8.7.B(3), Landmark Designation Criteria, or any one or more of the following:
                a. That the historic resource has been destroyed or demolished by natural disaster, accident or fire;

            iv. No person shall carry out any demolition, in whole or part, on any landmark, without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness approval from the Commission.
            v. Each property designated as a landmark shall be maintained to ensure weather resistance and a secured condition, faithful to its historic character.
            vi. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent routine maintenance and repair, as defined. Any exterior alteration, restoration, renovation, reconstruction in compliance with the definition of routine repair and maintenance shall be permissible without application and review. Property owners and/or their representatives are encouraged to consult with staff prior to any work being performed to discuss its scope and compliance with the definition of routine maintenance and repair; however, consultation is not required.
(3) Landmark Designation Criteria
The Commission shall evaluate each historic resource within an area that is included in an application and may designate it as a landmark if it is determined to possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association; and, being at least 50 years old or having achieved significance within the past 50 years if the property is of exceptional importance; and exhibits one or more of the following:
    a. Association with events that have made significant contributions to the broad patterns of our local, state, or national history; or
    b. Association with the lives of persons significant in our local, state, or national past; or
    c. Embodiment of distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction, or representing the work of a master architect, artist, engineer, or craftsman, or high artistic values or representing a significant and distinguishable entity which individual components may lack distinctiveness; or
    d. Information important in the understanding of the pre-history or history of our community or region.

C. Historic District Designation
(1) Purpose
This section establishes the procedures for the designation of a historic district, which is an overlay zone in which designated properties retain the uses of and are subject to the regulations of the underlying zoning district(s). The underlying zoning, which relates primarily to land use and density, continues to be administered by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Historic Preservation Commission administers the regulations as they relate to the historic district designation. In the case where historic preservation and zoning regulations conflict, the Historic Preservation Ordinance takes precedence.
(2) Application Submittal and Review Procedure
A rezoning approval is required in order to receive a historic district designation. The application and review process for a rezoning to a historic district shall be the same as for general rezonings as set forth in Section 8.6.A, Rezoning (Zoning Map Amendment), with the following modifications:
    a. Authorization to File Application
        1. If more than one property owner is included in a proposed rezoning to a historic district, written consent of at least 51 percent of the property owners of record within the boundaries of the proposed district shall be submitted with the application.
        2. Requests for historic district designations may be initiated by the Historic Preservation Commission, Planning and Zoning Commission, City Council, a property owner, or the agent of a property owner.
    b. Application Submittal and Handling
        1. An application for rezoning to a historic district shall first be submitted to the Historic Preservation Commission.
        2. Upon acceptance of complete application for a historic district, no demolition or building permits shall be issued by the City until the process as described in this section has been completed and City Council has made its decision.
    c. Review and Recommendation (Historic Preservation Commission)
        1. The Historic Preservation Commission shall hold a public hearing concerning the proposed rezoning, at which time interested parties and citizens shall have the opportunity to be heard. After the public hearing, unless the applicant requests that the application be withdrawn, the Historic Preservation Commission shall make a report and recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
        2. The recommendation shall include the following:
            i. A map showing the proposed boundaries of the historic district and identifying all structures within the boundaries, including classification as contributing or noncontributing;
            ii. An explanation of the significance of the proposed district and description of the cultural resources within the proposed boundaries;
            iii. A set of findings documenting the recommendation of the Historic Preservation Commission;
            iv. Proposed design guidelines for applying the criteria for review to future development and redevelopment in the nominated historic district; and
            v. The recommendations of the Commission may include reasonable additional conditions and/or modifications to the proposed district property boundaries as deemed necessary to promote the purpose of the district.
        3. If an application is withdrawn after the Historic Preservation Commission hearing, the Historic Preservation Commission may refuse to accept another application for the same or substantially the same rezoning on the same property or any part of it within a year of the date the original application was filed on the same property or a portion of it.
    d. Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission
    The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the Historic Preservation Commission’s recommendations. Following conclusion of its public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit its recommendation to the City Council.
    e. Action by the City Council
    Following conclusion of its public hearing, the Council may approve the historic district as recommended or in a modified form, stipulating those conditions it deems necessary to carry out the purpose of this district and this Code.
    f. Approval and Adoption
    The supporting statements, design guidelines, and all other documents submitted with the application for a historic district shall be approved and adopted by the Council and included in the ordinance establishing the historic district.
    g. Effect of Historic District Designation
        1. Upon approval of a historic district designation by the City Council, the affected property(ies) shall be included in the Historic Property Register and on any other applicable documents as appropriate for its preservation. The City’s Zoning Map shall be updated to reflect the new zoning district boundaries. The City’s parcel information database shall be updated to include those properties identified within the historic district as contributing and noncontributing.
        2. No person shall carry out any exterior alteration, restoration, renovation, reconstruction, new construction, demolition, or removal, in whole or in part, without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Commission pursuant to Section 8.7.E.
        3. No person shall make any material change in the exterior appearance of a designated property, its color, materials, light fixtures, signs, sidewalks, fences, steps, paving, or other elements which affect the appearance of the property without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness pursuant to Section 8.7.E.
        4. Each property designated as a contributing property shall be maintained in good condition and faithful to its historic character.
        5. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent normal maintenance and repair which does not involve change in exterior design, material, color, or appearance.
        6. In addition to any other required review and/or approval, any proposed construction within a historic district shall also be subject to Commission review according to any design guidelines which may have been applied to that district and other applicable criteria.
(3) Historic District Designation Criteria
Each structure, site, building, landscape, or property within an area that is included in a historic district rezoning application shall be evaluated and may be designated a historic district if it is determined to possess integrity of location, design, settings, materials, workmanship, feeling and association; and be at least 50 years old or having achieved significance within the past 50 years if the property is of exceptional importance; and exhibits one or more of the following:
    a. Association with events that have made significant contributions to the broad patterns of our local, state, or national history;
    b. Association with the lives of persons significant in our local, state, or national past;
    c. Embodiment of distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or representing the work of a master architect, artist, engineer or craftsman, or high artistic values or representative of a significant and distinguishable property or person whose individual components may lack distinctions; and
    d. Information important in the understanding of the pre-history or history of the community or region.

D. Economic Hardship
(1) An application for demolition or removal of a landmark or property within a historic district may, if appropriate, be accompanied by a request for relief from economic hardship.
(2) Before granting such request, the Commission shall study the historic or cultural value of the property and shall review options including incentives to the owner for restoration or recommendation to Council that the City purchase the property.
(3) Separate standards and application requirements may be established by the City for granting economic hardship relief for income-producing properties and for nonincome-producing properties.
    a. Investment or Income-Producing Properties
    Economic hardship relief may be granted if the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that a reasonable rate of return cannot be obtained from a property which retains features which contribute to its distinctive appearance and character, either in its present condition or if rehabilitated, either by the current owner or a potential buyer. Economic hardship relief shall not be granted due to any of the following circumstances: willful destructive acts committed or caused by the owner or tenants; purchase of the property for substantially more than its fair market value; failure to perform normal maintenance and repair; or failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants or provide normal tenant improvements.
    b. Nonincome-Producing Properties
    Economic hardship relief may be granted if the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that the property has no reasonable use as a single-family dwelling or for institutional use, either in its present condition or if rehabilitated, either by the current owner or a potential buyer. Economic hardship relief shall not be granted due to any of the following circumstances: willful destructive acts committed or caused by the owner; purchase of the property for substantially more than its fair market value; failure to perform normal maintenance and repair; or failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants or provide normal tenant improvements.

E. Certificate of Appropriateness (or No Effect)
(1) Purpose
It is the intent of this process to ensure, insofar as possible, that properties designated as a landmark or a property within a historic district shall be in harmony with the architectural and historical character of the property or district.
(2) Applicability
    a. Certificate of Appropriateness
    A Certificate of Appropriateness is required before commencing any exterior improvements or development, including alteration, restoration, renovation, reconstruction, new construction, demolition, or removal, in whole or in part, of any landmark or property located within a historic district, whether or not the work will require a building permit. Building permits for exterior work on landmarks or properties within historic districts cannot be issued without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness.
    b. Certificate of No Effect
    Requests for exterior improvements, including alterations, restoration, renovation, reconstruction, or new construction for exterior work on landmarks that are deemed to be of “no effect” by the Chairperson and Director may be eligible for a certificate of no effect, which can be issued administratively using the procedure below.
    c. Certificate is Prerequisite to Building Permit
    If a building permit is sought from the City without a Certificate of Appropriateness or certificate of no effect, the issuance of the permit shall be deferred until after a Certificate of Appropriateness or certificate of no effect is issued for the subject property.
(3) Application Submittal and Review Procedure
Figure 8-15 identifies the applicable steps from Section 8.3, Common Review Procedures, that apply to the review of applications for certificates of appropriateness (or no effect). Additions or modifications to the common review procedures are noted below.Figure 8-15: Certificate of Appropriateness (or No Effect)
[IMAGE: <Figure8-15.png>]
    a. Pre-Application Meeting
    A pre-application meeting shall be held in accordance with Section 8.3.B, Pre-Application Meeting.
    b. Application Submittal and Handling
    The application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be submitted, accepted, and revised, and may be withdrawn, in accordance with Section 8.3.C, Application Submittal and Handling.
    c. Staff Review and Action
    The Director shall review the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness and prepare a staff report and recommendation in accordance with Section 8.3.E, Staff Review and Action, with the following addition:
        1. Application Acceptance
        Upon acceptance of a complete application, no building or demolition permits affecting the proposed landmark shall be issued by the City until the process as described herein has been completed and the Commission has made its decision.
        2. Certificate of No Effect
        If an application qualifies for a certificate of no effect, the Director shall contact the Chairperson of the Historic Preservation Commission to review the application and confirm qualification of the application. If an application is found to qualify for a certificate of no effect, the Director shall issue a certificate of no effect within seven working days of receipt of the complete application.
    d. Scheduling and Notice of Public Hearings
    If the Director determines that the proposed changes would require a Certificate of Appropriateness, the application shall be scheduled for a public hearing before the Historic Preservation Commission and noticed in accordance with Section 8.3.F, Scheduling and Notice of Public Hearings.
    e. Review and Decision (Historic Preservation Commission)
    The Commission shall review the application and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application in accordance with Section 8.3.G, Review and Decision, based on the specific criteria in Section 8.7.E(4), Certificate of Appropriateness Approval Criteria.
        1. Review Guidelines and Criteria
        The Commission may utilize the following documents and criteria as guidelines when considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness:
            i. Approved design guidelines for a designated historic district;
            ii. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation;
            iii. Secretary of the Interior’s Preservation Briefs and other information developed by U.S. Department of the Interior Park Service, Arizona Historic Preservation Office, National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Alliance of Preservation Commissions, Association of Preservation Technology, and the Old House Journal; and
            iv. Any other guidelines as adopted by the City.
    f. Post-Decision Actions and Limitations
    All common procedures in Section 8.3.H, Post-Decision Actions and Limitations, shall apply, with the following modifications:
        1. No change shall be made in the approved plans of a project after issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness without resubmittal to the Director and approval of the change at an administrative level, if that change is determined to be of no significant impact on the original proposed work set forth in the application. If the change is determined to have a significant impact on the original proposed work, the Director shall schedule a public hearing before the Commission in the same manner as the original Certificate of Appropriateness consideration.
        2. A Certificate of Appropriateness (or no effect) expires six months from the date of issuance unless work is started within that time.
        3. If work exceeds that specified in the Certificate of Appropriateness (or no effect), the certificate shall be revoked.
        4. The Certificate of Appropriateness (or no effect) required by this section shall be in addition to any other permit(s) or review required for the proposed project.
(4) Certificate of Appropriateness Approval Criteria
It is the intent of this article to ensure, insofar as possible, that a historic resource designated as a landmark within an historic district shall be in harmony with and complementary to the architectural and historical character of the historic resource or district. When reviewing an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a Certificate of Appropriateness based on the following:
    a. Any proposed new construction shall be distinguishable from the historic architecture; and
    b. The proposed work does not detrimentally alter, destroy or adversely affect any architectural or landscape feature; and
    c. The proposed work will be compatible with the relevant historic, cultural, educational or architectural qualities characteristic of the structure or district and shall include but not be limited to materials and elements of size, scale, massing, proportions, orientation, surface textures and patterns, details and embellishments and the relationship of these elements to one another; and
    d. The proposed work conforms with review guidelines and/or other applicable criteria; and
    e. The exterior of any new improvement, building, or structure in a designated historic district or upon a landmarked site will not adversely affect and will be compatible with the external appearance of existing designated buildings and structures on the site or within a historic district.

F. Demolition of Historic Resource
(1) Demolition Approval Required
No person, firm, corporation, or other entity shall demolish a landmark or contributing property within a historic district or cause or allow such demolition to be done, nor shall any permit for such demolition be issued, unless the demolition is approved by the Commission and a Certificate of Appropriateness is issued.
(2) Demolition Approval Criteria
    a. A landmark or contributing property may be demolished if:
        1. The Chief Building Official has determined that an imminent safety hazard exists and that demolition of the structure is the only feasible means to secure the public safety; or
        2. The Commission finds, after review, that maintenance, use and/or alteration of the designated property in accordance with the requirements of this article would cause immediate and substantial economic hardship on the property owner(s) because rehabilitation in a manner which preserves the historic integrity of the resource:
            i. Is infeasible from a technical, mechanical, or structural standpoint; and/or
            ii. Would leave the property with no reasonable economic value because it would require an unreasonable expenditure taking into account such factors as current market value, permitted uses of the property, and the cost of compliance with applicable local, state and federal requirements.
            Costs necessitated by the neglect or failure of the current owner(s) to maintain the property need not be considered in making this finding; or
        3. The Commission finds that the demolition of a contributing property would not have a substantial adverse impact on the historic significance or integrity of a historic district.
    b. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof for all findings required for approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition.
    c. Notice of Demolition
    If demolition is approved, the property owner(s) may be required to publish notice at least 10 days prior to the scheduled demolition date, in a newspaper of general circulation, of the availability of materials for salvage. Upon request, the Commission may make this information available to persons who may be interested in contacting the owner(s) to arrange for possible salvage of historic building materials.
(3) Architectural Documentation Prior to Demolition of Historic Buildings
Applications for permits for the demolition of buildings that are in part (original structure with later additions) or in their entirety 50 or more years old must include architectural documentation to provide a permanent record of buildings of historical significance before their loss. Demolition applications are available from the Community Development Department.
    a. Applicability
    These regulations apply to all demolition permit requests involving buildings that are in part or in their entirety 50 or more years old, but are not individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places; and do not meet the eligibility criteria for the National Register of Historic Places or Designation as a Landmark in Sedona. Documentation is not required if the demolition will be limited to an addition that is less than 50 years old, for accessory buildings such as sheds, and mobile or manufactured homes regardless of age.
    b. Review Required
    The applicant must submit documentation in conjunction with a demolition permit application submittal. The documentation will be reviewed and found complete pursuant to this article prior to issuance of a demolition permit.
    c. Application and Review Process
        1. Prior to the submittal of a demolition permit application, the applicant may meet with the Director. At that time, the Director will determine whether the application requires documentation.
        2. At the time of submittal, the applicant must submit the demolition permit application and all required architectural documentation to the Community Development Department.
        3. The Director shall review the submitted architectural documentation and approve the materials for completeness. The Director determines and informs the applicant that the required architectural documentation is complete, or of any additional documentation which is required within five working days of the submittal date.
        4. If the Director determines that the required architectural documentation is complete, then a demolition permit application may be processed. The applicant must demonstrate compliance with all provisions of the LDC before a demolition permit will be issued.
    d. Documentation Required
        1. Current photographs of the front, rear and sides of the building to be completely or partially demolished; and
        2. Copies of old photographs of the building to be completely or partially demolished (taken at least 20 years prior to the demolition application), if in the possession of the applicant; and
        3. A list of any important historical events or historically significant persons related to the building to be demolished, if known to the applicant.
    e. Documentation Optional
        1. Floor plans with measured dimensions; and
        2. Photographs of all interior rooms; and
        3. A “context photograph” illustrating the relationship between the building to be completely or partially demolished and the nearest adjacent buildings; and
        4. A general description of construction materials, such as exterior walls, roofing, windows, porches, and carports of the building to be demolished.
    f. Documentation Retention
    Upon approval of the demolition permit, the Director shall retain the architectural documentation as a record of a lost historic resource.

G. Maintenance and Repair
(1) Each historic resource designated as a landmark, and historic resources designated as contributing properties within a historic district, shall be properly maintained in weather-resistant, secure condition and faithful to its historic appearance and character.
(2) Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of any exterior feature of any historic resource designated as a landmark or contributing property within a historic district, which does not involve change in design, material, color, or exterior appearance. The Commission shall not consider the interior arrangements or alterations to the interior of a building, unless designation specifically includes the interior or a portion thereof.
(3) All exterior maintenance and repair not deemed to be routine maintenance and repair as defined herein, requires an application for determination of a Certificate of Appropriateness or Certificate of No Effect. Repairs that involve change in exterior appearance may be determined by the Director and Chairperson to have no significant impact on historic appearance and character, and thereby qualify for a Certificate of No Effect.
[Ord. 2018-12, 11-14-18 (Res. 2018-34)].

8.8. Flexibility and Relief

A. Variance
(1) Purpose
The variance procedure is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this Code where strict application of the Code would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship preventing the use of the land as otherwise allowed by the Code. The variance procedure is not intended to allow a use in a zoning district where it is not currently permitted, or to alleviate inconveniences or financial burdens imposed on landowners.
(2) Applicability
    a. Any property owner seeking relief from this Code may request a variance when the strict application of the Code would result in an undue hardship.
    b. Variances may be granted from the regulations of all articles of this Code, with the exception of Section 5.3, Grading and Drainage, and Article 7: Subdivision.
(3) Application Submittal and Review Procedure
Figure 8-16 identifies the applicable steps from Section 8.3, Common Review Procedures, that apply to the review of variances. Additions or modifications to the common review procedures are noted below.Figure 8-16: Variance
[IMAGE: <Figure8-16.png>]
    a. Pre-Application Meeting
    A pre-application meeting shall be held in accordance with Section 8.3.B, Pre-Application Meeting.
    b. Application Submittal and Handling
    The variance application shall be submitted, accepted, and revised, and may be withdrawn, in accordance with Section 8.3.C, Application Submittal and Handling. A single application may include requests for variances from more than one regulation applicable to the same site, or for similar variances on two or more adjacent sites with similar characteristics.
    c. Staff Review and Action
    The Director shall review the application and prepare a staff report and recommendation in accordance with Section 8.3.E, Staff Review and Action.
    d. Scheduling and Notice of Public Hearings
    The variance application shall be scheduled for a public hearing before the Board of Adjustment and noticed in accordance with Section 8.3.F, Scheduling and Notice of Public Hearings.
    e. Review and Decision (Board of Adjustment)
        1. The Board shall hold a public hearing on an application for a variance. At a public hearing, the Board shall review the application, statements and drawings submitted and shall receive public comments and pertinent evidence concerning the variance, particularly with respect to the findings in Section 8.8.A(4).
        2. Within 21 days following the close of the public hearing on a variance application, the Board shall act on the application.
            i. The Board may grant a variance as the variance was applied for or in a modified form or the application may be denied.
            ii. A variance may be revocable, may be granted for a limited time period, or may be granted subject to conditions the Board may prescribe.
            iii. Upon failure to act within the prescribed 21-day period, the Board shall lose jurisdiction and the request shall be deemed denied. An appeal may be taken to the Superior Court, as prescribed by state law.
            iv. Any proposed revisions or changes to an approved variance application shall be submitted in the same manner and subject to the same approval process as the original review.
        3. The Board’s decision shall be based only on the record of the public hearing and shall be reduced to writing; include findings of fact based on competent, material, and substantial evidence presented at the hearing; reflect the determination of contested facts; and state how the findings support compliance with applicable review standards.
    f. Post-Decision Actions and Limitations
    All common procedures in Section 8.3.H, Post-Decision Actions and Limitations, shall apply, with the following modification:
        1. Expiration and Revocation of Variance Approval
        A variance permit shall expire and may be considered for revocation following one year of inactivity, as defined in Section 8.3.H(3), Expiration and Revocation of Approval.
(4) Variance Findings
The Board of Adjustment may approve a variance upon making all of the following findings:
    a. The subject property has an exceptional shape, topography, building configuration or other exceptional site condition that is not a general condition throughout the zone district;
    b. The strict application of the Code standards for which a variance is sought would produce undue hardship not related to purposes of convenience or financial burden;
    c. The applicant did not create the hardship by their own actions;
    d. The variance requested does not harm the public and does not impair the intent or purposes of this Code, goals, and policies, including the specific regulation for which the variance is sought;
    e. The variance request will not violate building or fire code requirements or create a safety hazard; and
    f. The requested variance is the minimum relief necessary from the subject standards of the Code.

B. Minor Modification
(1) Purpose
The minor modification procedure is intended to allow relatively small adjustments or deviations from the dimensional or numeric standards of this Code where strict application of the Code would result in practical difficulty or undue hardship preventing the use of the land as otherwise allowed by the Code. Minor modifications are intended to provide greater flexibility when necessary, without requiring a formal zoning amendment or variance. The minor modification procedure is not a waiver of current standards of this Code and shall not be used to circumvent the variance procedure.
(2) Applicability
    a. Other Incentives are Prerequisite
    All available incentives and allowances in this Code shall be used before a minor modification may be considered, including but not limited to the exceptions in Section 2.24, Measurements and Exceptions. (For example, an applicant shall apply all available alternate standards for increased height before applying for a minor modification for increased height.)
    b. Table of Allowable Minor Modifications
    An application for a minor modification that is not related to a request for “reasonable accommodation” under the Federal Fair Housing Act or the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act may request only the types of adjustments shown in Table 8.3.

    c. Reasonable Accommodations Under the FFHA
        1. In response to a written application identifying the type of housing being provided and the portions of the Federal Fair Housing Act that require that reasonable accommodations be made for such housing, the Director is authorized to take any of the following actions in order to provide reasonable accommodations without the need for a rezoning or variance:
            i. Modify any facility spacing, building setback, height, lot coverage, or landscaping requirement by no more than 10 percent; or
            ii. Reduce any off-street parking requirement by no more than one space.
        2. The Director may approve a type of reasonable accommodation different from that requested by the applicant if the Director concludes that a different form of accommodation would satisfy the requirements of the Federal Fair Housing Act with fewer impacts on adjacent areas. The decision of the Director shall be accompanied by written findings of fact as to the applicability of the Fair Housing Act, the need for reasonable accommodations, and the authority for any reasonable accommodations approved. Requests for types of accommodation that are not listed above may only be approved through a variance or rezoning process.
    d. Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA)
    The Director may grant minor modifications in order to eliminate a substantial burden on religious exercise as guaranteed by the Federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, as amended. In no circumstance shall the Director approve a modification that allows a religious assembly use, or any uses, structures, or activities accessory to it, in a zoning district where this Code prohibits such use or accessory use, structure, or activity.
(3) Limitations on Minor Modifications
    a. Except when requested as a reasonable accommodation for FFHA or RLUIPA purposes, a request for a minor modification shall not be used to further modify a development standard that, as applied to the subject property, already qualifies as an exception to, or modification of, a generally applicable development standard required under Article 5: Development Standards.
    b. The minor modification procedure shall not apply to any proposed modification or deviation that results in:
        1. An increase in the overall project density;
        2. A change in permitted uses or mix of uses;
        3. A deviation from building or fire codes;
        4. A deviation from engineering standards;
        5. Requirements for public roadways, utilities, or other public infrastructure or facilities; or
        6. A change to a development standard where that same standard was already modified through a separate minor modification or variance.
(4) Application Submittal and Review Procedure
    a. Application Submittal and Handling
        1. An application for a minor modification shall only be submitted and reviewed concurrently with an application for a conditional use permit, temporary use permit, development review approval (minor or major), single-family residential review, or plat approval (minor, preliminary, final, or condominium). Each Code standard in Table 8.3 shall be considered a separate minor modification request as it relates to the approval criteria in Section 8.8.B(5), but multiple modifications may be considered in one minor modification application.
        2. A minimum of 15 days prior to a decision on a proposed minor modification, the owners of all properties within 100 feet of the exterior boundaries of the subject property shall be notified by first class mail.
    b. Review and Decision
        1. Where the concurrently reviewed application requires review and approval by the Director, the Director shall review the application and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the modification based on the criteria in Section 8.8.B(5).
        2. Where the concurrently reviewed application requires review and approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council, the Commission or Council, as applicable, shall review and decide the minor modification application based on the criteria in Section 8.8.B(5).
    c. Effect of Approval
    Approval of a minor modification authorizes only the particular adjustment of standards approved, and only to the subject property of the application.
    d. Expiration of Minor Modification
    A minor modification shall automatically expire if the associated development application is denied or if approval of the concurrently reviewed application expires, is revoked, or otherwise deemed invalid.
(5) Minor Modification Approval Criteria
A minor modification may be approved if the decision-making body finds that the modification:
    a. Will not create a hardship on adjacent properties;
    b. Is not necessitated by the applicant’s actions;
    c. Is subject to conditions to ensure that the modification shall not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the subject property is located;
    d. Will not result in adverse impacts unless adequately mitigated;
    e. Furthers the goals of the Sedona Community Plan or other adopted plans; and/or
    f. Is of a technical nature and is required to:
        1. Compensate for an unusual site condition; or
        2. Protect a sensitive resource, natural feature, or community asset.

C. CFA Alternative Standards Request

        3. The Director may authorize the development of accessory uses that are not otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) but that are supported by and consistent with the goals and standards of the adopted CFA plan. In providing such authorization, the Director may establish use-specific standards applicable to such accessory uses beyond those set forth in Section 3.3, Use-Specific Standards.
    b. Not Eligible if Already Modified
        1. The application of CFA Alternative standards authorized by this section shall not be considered where the same standard(s) on the subject property were already modified through a separate minor modification or variance.
        2. Modifications to an approved PD plan require a PD plan amendment pursuant to Section 8.6.B(3)g.4, PD Plan Amendments.

        1. The requirement of a dedication or exaction as a condition of granting approval for the use, improvement, or development of real property; or
        2. The adoption or amendment of a zoning regulation that creates a taking of property in violation of A.R.S. § 9-500.13.
