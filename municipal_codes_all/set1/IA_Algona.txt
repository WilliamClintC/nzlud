ALGONA, IOWA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Algona, Iowa 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Algona, Iowa, Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1988, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Paul R. Doster, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1039, passed November 5, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

In lieu of such bond, the holder of a franchise, license or lease may provide proof of self-insurance which the city many deem to be an acceptable alternative.

2.  Misappropriates property which the person has in trust, or property of another which the person has in the person's possession or control, whether such possession is lawful or unlawful, by using or disposing of it in a manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the trust or of the owner's right's in such property, or appropriates such property to the person's own use, when the owner of such property is known to the person. Failure by a bailee or lessee of personal property to return the property within seventy-two hours after a time specified in a written agreement of lease or bailment shall be evidence of misappropriation. 
3.  Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer of possession, or ownership of another, or the beneficial use of property of another, by deception. When compensation for goods and services is ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of such goods or the rendering of such services, the refusal to pay or leaving the premises without payment or offer to pay or without having obtained from the owner or operator the right to pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives rise to an inference that the goods or services were obtained by deception. 
4.  Exercises control over stolen property knowing such property to have been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that such property has been stolen, unless the person's purpose is to promptly restore it to the owner or to deliver it to an appropriate public officer. The fact that a person is found in possession of property which has been stolen from two or more persons on separate occasions, or that the person is a dealer or other person familiar with the value of such property and has acquired it for a consideration which is far below its reasonable value, shall be evidence from which the court or jury may infer that the person knew or believed that the property had been stolen. 
5.  Takes, destroys, conceals, or disposes of property in which someone else has a security interest, with the intent to defraud the secured party. 
6.  This paragraph intentionally omitted. 
7.  Obtains gas, electricity or water from a public utility or obtains cable television or telephone service from an unauthorized connection to the supply or service line or by intentionally altering, adjusting, removing or tampering with the metering or service device so as to cause inaccurate readings. 
8.  This paragraph intentionally omitted. 
9.  Obtains the temporary use of video rental property with the intent to deprive the owner of the use and possession of the video rental property without the consent of the owner. 
10.  Any act that is declared to be theft by any provision of the Algona Municipal Code. 
B.  The theft of property as defined above not exceeding two hundred dollars in value is a simple misdemeanor. 
(Ord. 910 § 4 (part), 2003)

9.36.030 - Video rental property theft.

B.  The fact that a person obtains possession of video rental property by means of deception, including but not limited to furnishing a false name, address, or other identification to the owner, is evidence that possession was obtained with intent to knowingly deprive the owner of the use and possession of the video rental property. 
C.  The fact that a person having lawfully obtained possession of video rental property, fails to pay the owner the fair market value of the video rental property or to return or make arrangements acceptable to the owner to return the video rental property to the owner within forty-eight hours after receipt of written notice and demand from the owner is evidence of an intent to knowingly deprive the owner of the use and possession of the video rental property. 
D.  It shall be an affirmative defense to a prosecution under Section 9.36.010(A)(9)(a), if the defendant in possession of video rental property pays the owner the fair market value of the video rental property or returns the property to the owner within forty-eight hours of arrest, together with any standard overdue charges for the period that the owner was unlawfully deprived of possession, but not to exceed one hundred twenty days, and the value of the damage to the property, if any. 
(Ord. 910 § 4 (part), 2003) 
9.36.040 - Theft detection devices-Shield or removal prohibited. 
A.  A person shall not remove or attempt to remove a theft detection device with the intent of committing a theft and without the permission of the merchant who is displaying or selling the goods, wares or merchandise. 
B.  For the purposes of this section, "theft detection shielding device" means any laminated or coated bag or device designed to shield merchandise from detection by an electronic or magnetic theft alarm system or any other system designed to alert a person of a possible theft.

Chapter 10.52 - ABANDONED VEHICLES 

10.52.010 - Definitions. 
    For use in this chapter the following terms are defined: 
A.  "Abandoned vehicle" means any of the following: 
1.  A vehicle that has been left unattended on public property for more than forty-eight hours and lacks current registration plates or two or more wheels or other parts which renders the vehicle inoperable; or 
2.  A vehicle that has remained illegally on public property for more than seventy-two hours; or 
3.  A vehicle that has been unlawfully parked on private property or has been placed on private property without the consent of the owner or person in control of the property for more than twenty-four hours; or 
4.  A vehicle that has been legally impounded by order of the police department and has not been reclaimed for a period of ten days; or 
5.  Any vehicle parked upon a street determined by the police department to create a hazard or obstruction to other vehicle traffic. 
If the owner or operator of a vehicle is unable to move the vehicle, notifies the police department of his problem and requests assistance in the removal of the vehicle, then a vehicle shall not be considered abandoned for a period of fifteen days from the date the police were notified. 
B.  "Department" means the police department of the city of Algona, Iowa. 
C.  "Private property" means any real property within the city which is not public property as defined in this section. 
D.  "Public roperty" means any public right-of-way open for the purposes of vehicular travel. 
E.  "Vehicle" means every device in, upon, or by which a person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway or street, excepting devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks, and shall include without limitation a motor vehicle, automobile, truck, trailer, motorcycle, tractor, buggy, wagon, farm machinery or any combination thereof. 
(Added during 1988 codification) 
10.52.020 - Impoundment-Authority. 
    The department may, without prior notice or hearing, remove and impound any abandoned vehicle on public property and any abandoned vehicle on private property. The department may employ city personnel, equipment and facilities or hire other personnel, equipment and facilities for the purpose of removing, preserving, storing or disposing abandoned vehicles. Nothing in this chapter shall govern the procedures of any police officer in taking into custody and impounding any vehicle to be used or proposed to be used as evidence in a criminal case involving crimes other than violations of this chapter. 
(Added during 1988 codification) 
10.52.030 - Impoundment-Notification of owners and lienholders. 
A.  When a vehicle is taken into custody under the provisions of this chapter or under any provisions of state law, the department shall notify, within twenty days, by certified mail, the last known registered owner of the vehicle, all lienholders of record, and any other known claimant to the vehicle or to personal property found in the vehicle, addressed to their last known addresses of record, that the abandoned vehicle has been taken into custody. Notice shall be deemed given when mailed. The notice shall describe the year, make, model and serial number of the vehicle, describe the personal property found in the vehicle, set forth the location of the facility where the vehicle is being held, and inform the persons receiving the notice of their right to reclaim the vehicle and personal property within twenty-one days after the effective date of the notice upon payment of all towing, preservation and storage charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of notice required pursuant to this section. The notice shall also state that the failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within the time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner and all lienholders of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle and that failure to reclaim the vehicle is deemed consent to the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or disposal of the vehicle to a demolisher. The notice shall state that any person claiming rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes the planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the department or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this section may ask for a hearing before the city administrator to contest those matters. The notice shall also state that a request for a hearing must be in writing and received by the department prior to the expiration of the twenty-one-day reclaiming period. In addition, the notice shall state that in the event a hearing is requested, immediate release of the vehicle may be obtained by posting a cash bond in an amount equal to the sum of the impoundment fee, towing charges, preservation charges, storage charges and notice charges. If the persons receiving the notice do not ask for a hearing or do not exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within the twenty-one-day reclaiming period, the owner and lienholders shall no longer have any right, title, claim or interest in or to the vehicle. No court in any case in law or equity shall recognize any right, title, claim or interest of the owner and lienholders after the expiration of the twenty-one-day reclaiming period. 
B.  If the identity of the last registered owner cannot be determined, or if the registration contains no address for the owner, or if it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and addresses of all lienholders, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general circulation in the area where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all requirements of notice under this section. The published notice may contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles but shall be published within the same time requirements and contain the same information as prescribed for mailed notice in this section. 
C.  The owner or any lienholders may, by written request delivered to the department prior to the expiration of the twenty-one-day reclaiming period, obtain an additional fourteen days within which the vehicle may be reclaimed. 
(Added during 1988 codification) 
10.52.040 - Impoundment-Fees. 
    Before the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of any vehicle that has been impounded under the provisions of this chapter or any other provision of law may recover such vehicle, such person shall present to the department evidence of such person's identity and right to possession of the vehicle, shall sign a receipt for its return, and shall pay the costs of: 
A.  An impoundment fee of ten dollars if claimed within five days of impounding, plus one dollar for each additional day within the reclaiming period; and 
B.  Towing charges; and 
C.  Preservation charges; and 
D.  Storage charges; and 
E.  Notice charges. 
(Added during 1988 codification) 
10.52.050 - Impoundment-Hearing. 
A.  The registered owner or any lienholder of record may object to the legality of the impoundment or the assessment of fees and request a hearing thereon. Request for a hearing after an impoundment shall be made in writing and received by the department prior to the expiration of the twenty-one-day reclaiming period. No person shall be entitled to more than one hearing on each impoundment. After requesting a hearing, the objector shall be informed of the reason for the impoundment and a hearing shall be held, without unnecessary delay, before a hearing officer who shall be the city administrator. Upon request of the objector, the hearing may be set for a later time and date, however, the new date shall be no later than twenty days after the original hearing date. 
B.  At the hearing, the hearing officer shall consider the objection, make a decision as to the legality of the impoundment and immediately notify the objector in writing of the decision. The decision shall state either of the following: 
1.  That impoundment is authorized by law, an explanation for the basis of that decision, and an itemization of the charges assessed pursuant to this chapter. Any bond posted shall be applied to the satisfaction of the charges itemized by the hearing officer; 
2.  That impoundment is not authorized by law, and if the vehicle has been impounded, that the vehicle will be released to the objector upon the objector presenting to the department evidence of such person's identity and right to possession of the vehicle, and after the objector signs a receipt for its return. All costs of removal, preservation, storage and notification accruing through the fourth day after the hearing officer's decision are waived and will be paid by the city. All costs accruing thereafter shall be paid prior to recovery of the vehicle. Any bond posted shall be refunded. 
C.  The decision of the hearing officer shall be final. 
D.  Failure of the objector to appear at the scheduled hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and the bond shall be forfeited. 
E.  The only issue to be considered at the hearing shall be the validity of the determination that the vehicle is an abandoned vehicle. The hearing will not be determinative of or adjudicate any outstanding or unsettled traffic violation notice or warrant. 
(Added during 1988 codification) 
10.52.060 - Auction or disposal-State statutes adopted.

(Ord. 998, § 1, 10-7-2013) 
13.04.690 - Inspections. 
    Every person, firm or corporation owning improved real estate or contractors/builders who are building a house or other structure within the city that discharges into the city's sanitary sewer system or on the ground shall allow an employee of the city or their designated representative to inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system. This requirement may also be met by having the property owner contract with a licensed plumber to perform the inspection. The plumber must inspect the property and the sump pump system and complete and return an inspection form provided by the city documenting the results of the inspection. All costs associated with an inspection by a privately retained plumber shall be the responsibility of the property owner. 
    Any property owner or contractor/builder of a new home refusing to allow their property to be inspected within thirty days of the date city employees or their designated representatives have requested admittance to the property, shall immediately become subject to the daily surcharge noted in Section 13.04.720, unless the property owner or contractor/builder of a new home pays the monthly surcharge in lieu of inspection as noted in Section 13.04.720. Any owner of property or contractor/house builder found to violate Article V of this chapter shall make the necessary changes to comply with Article V and furnish proof of the changes to the city within ninety days from the date the city delivered notice of the violation to the owner or contractor/builder.

1.  Any person found to be violating any provision of Article V of this chapter, shall be served by the city with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing at least ninety days for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations. 
2.  Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit provided for in subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of a municipal infraction. Each day in which any such violation occurs shall be deemed a separate offense. 
3.  Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the city by reason of such violation. The city will also retain any and all civil remedies including but not limited to injunction or abatement actions to remedy a violation. 
4.  In addition to the penalties noted above, a civil surcharge of ten dollars per day may be imposed by invoice and/or added to every sewer billing mailed to tenants or property owners or to the contractor/builder of a new house which are found not to be in compliance herein. The surcharge will be levied daily against those properties found not to be in compliance with Article V of this chapter until the property has been certified by the public works director or his or her representative that the property is in compliance. The surcharge will be levied against the tenant or property owner and/or contractor/builder of a new house on the thirty-first day after notice of the violation has been provided to the tenant/owner/contractor/builder. Should a person who has been notified of noncompliance and has corrected that noncompliance, be found out of compliance with Article V of this chapter a second time, said person will be fined one hundred dollars a day commencing upon the day said person is found to be in noncompliance. There shall be no grace period for bringing the system into compliance a second time. 
5.  A property owner or the contractor/builder of a new home can pay a monthly surcharge of one hundred dollars in order to avoid a viewing of the property to determine if the property is engaged in an illegal discharge into the sanitary sewer system. This surcharge shall commence on the first day of the month following the month when either the property owner or contractor/builder provides written notice to the city of their intent to act pursuant to this provision or thirty days after the city provides written notice to the property owner or contractor/builder of the need to permit access for inspection and the property owner or builder/contractor fails to permit inspection regardless of whether written notice is given to the city. This surcharge shall continue to accrue as long as the property owner or contractor/builder continues to own the property without providing the information noted above. This surcharge is intended to offset the added cost associated with having the wastewater treatment facility process clear water unnecessarily when the status of a property's connection to the sanitary sewer system cannot be ascertained.

6.  "Control zone" means airspace extending upward from the surface of the earth which may include one or more airports and is normally a circular area of five statutes, angles in radius, with extensions where necessary to include instrument approach and departure paths. 
7.  "Instrument runway" means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities or area type navigation equipment, for which an instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned. 
8.  "Minimum descent altitude" means the lowest altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure, where no electronic glide slope is provided. 
9.  "Minimum enroute altitude" means the altitude in effect between radio fixes which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets obstruction clearance requirements between those fixes. 
10.  "Minimum obstruction clearance altitude" means the specified altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airway routes, or route segments which meets obstruction clearance requirements for the entire route segment and which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within twenty-two miles of a VOR. 
11.  "Runway" means a defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
12.  "Visual runway" means a runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on a FAA approved airport layout plan, a military services approved military airport layout plan, or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority.

(Ord. 764 § 2, 1991; Ord. 756 §§ 2, 3, 1990: Ord. 750 § 1 (part), 1989) 
Article II. - Sewer Service Charge System 

13.12.020 - Creation. 
    The city establishes a sewer service charge system whereby revenues will be generated for debt service and operation, maintenance and replacement. 
(Ord. 750 § 1 (part), 1989) 
13.12.030 - Classes of users. 
    There will be two classes of users: 
A.  Residential, commercial and institutional; 
B.  Industrial. 
(Ord. 750 § 1 (part), 1989) 
13.12.040 - Rate structure. 
    All users will be billed based on the following rate structure: 
A.  Four dollars and twenty-two cents per service, per month, plus four dollars and twenty-eight cents per one hundred cubic feet of water use. 
1.  The fixed charge of four dollars and twenty-two cents (or the increased amount as provided in paragraph 3 below) per service, per month is for administration. 
2.  The charge per one hundred cubic feet of water use will be used for debt service, operation, maintenance and replacement. 
3.  Beginning July 1, 2017, and then on each July 1 thereafter, the four dollars and twenty-two cents per service, per month fee and the four dollars and twenty-eight cents per one hundred cubic feet of water use fee will both be automatically increased four percent each year, with the amounts being charged being rounded up to the next penny. 
B.  In addition to the rates stated above, users that discharge an extra-strength waste will be subject to an extra-strength service charge. An extra-strength waste is defined as a waste having either a BOD 5 concentration greater than three hundred milligrams per liter (mg/l) or a suspended solids concentration greater than three hundred fifty milligrams per liter (mg/l). The following formula will be used to compute the BOD 5 extra-strength service charge: 
BOD 5 Service Charge ($) = (Monthly Average BOD 5 (mg/l) - 300 (mg/l)) × (62.4 (lb/ft 3 ) × 10 -6 ) × (Total Monthly Flow in cubic feet) × (rate per pound ($)). Rate per pound is $0.15. The city council will set this rate on an annual basis. 
    The following formula will be used to compute the suspended solids extra-strength service charge: 
TSS Service Charge ($) = (Monthly Average TSS (mg/l) - 350 (mg/l)) × (62.4 (lb/ft 3 ) × 10 -6 ) × (Total Monthly Flow in cubic feet) × (rate per pound ($)). Rate per pound is $0.15. The city council will set this rate on an annual basis. 
    Negative values will not be credited against the billing. Users not providing automatic waste-monitoring equipment will be billed on the basis of BOD 5 and suspended solids as determined by analysis of twenty-four-hour composite samples collected during the billing period by the superintendent. Industrial users must provide a suitable point for metering and sample collection and shall cooperate in every way with the superintendent. Where it is evident that a constituent of the waste significantly inhibits the standard analysis of BOD 5 , the charges may be billed on the basis of the TOC analysis. 
C.  In addition to the rates stated above, users who are on property that discharges natural precipitation from a roof, sump pump, footing drain tile or other source into the city's sanitary sewer system will be subject to an additional service charge in the amount of twenty-one dollars and sixty cents per month. This additional service charge shall go into effect twelve months after the property owner has been notified that prohibited discharges are entering the sanitary sewer system and corrective action must be taken. For all property owners notified prior to July 1, 1996, this additional service charge will go into effect beginning July 1, 1997.

Appeals of any provision of any of the codes will be submitted in writing at least one week prior to a regular city council meeting. The Algona City Council has the power not only to interpret the codes but also to waive any provisions of a code as determined by majority vote. Such waivers may cover all construction or buildings in the city. The power of the city council to waive provisions of a code does not permit the council to impose rules or regulations not listed in the code without the normal amending procedure required by law when an ordinance is amended. The city council may, however, impose specific rules and agreements negotiated with an appellant concerning only the construction of a specific building as covered by a specific appeal. Granting of a waiver either with or without additional rules or regulations does not obligate the city council to make the same agreement with any other appellant. Each and every appeal will be considered separately on its own merit.

15.32.010 - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the city and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing flood losses with provisions designed to: 
A.  Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially; 
B.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
C.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public utilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement; 
D.  Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard; 
E.  Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.

(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999) 
(Ord. No. 1036, § 6, 1-15-2018) 
15.32.170 - Action on permit application. 
    The administrator shall, within a reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or disapprove the application. In addition, if the proposed floodplain development includes excavation, grading or filling of more than ten cubic yards of dirt, the city council shall also approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefor. The administrator shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by the board of adjustment. 
(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999) 
15.32.180 - Construction and use to be as provided in application and plans. 
    Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the state, that the finished fill, building floor elevations, floodproofing or other flood protection measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the use or occupancy of any structure. 
(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999) 
15.32.190 - Conditional uses, appeals and variances. 
    The board of adjustment shall hear and decide (1) applications for conditional uses upon which the board is authorized to pass under this chapter; (2) appeals, and (3) requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter; and shall take any other action which is required of the board. 
A.  Conditional Uses. Requests for conditional uses shall be submitted to the administrator, who shall forward such to the board of adjustment for consideration. Such requests shall include information ordinarily submitted with applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the board of adjustment. 
B.  Appeals. Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the board of adjustment and with the official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the board of adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
C.  Variances. The board of adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards. 
1.  Variances shall only be granted upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances. 
2.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the one hundred-year flood would result. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands. 
3.  Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
4.  In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the administrator that (a) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and (b) such construction increases risks to life and property. 
5.  All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the Department of Natural Resources. 
D.  Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment. 
1.  Hearings. Upon the filing with the board of adjustment of an appeal, an application for a conditional use or a request for a variance, the board shall hold a public hearing. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence. The board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department of Natural Resources. 
2.  Decisions. The board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal, conditional use or variance within a reasonable time. In passing upon an appeal, the board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision. In granting a conditional use or variance, the board shall consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe such conditions as contained in Section 15.32.210. 
(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999) 
15.32.200 - Factors upon which the decision to grant variances is based. 
    In passing upon applications for variances, the board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and: 
A.  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments; 
B.  The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream to the injury of others; 
C.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions; 
D.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
E.  The importance of the service provided by the proposed facility to the city; 
F.  The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location; 
G.  The availability of alternate locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use; 
H.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future; 
I.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
J.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
K.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site; 
L.  The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges; 
M.  Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter. 
(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999) 
15.32.210 - Conditions attached to variances. 
    Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to: 
A.  Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities; 
B.  Limitation on periods of use and operation; 
C.  Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions; 
D.  Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving the purpose of this chapter; 
E.  Floodproofing measures designed to be consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The board of adjustment shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area. 
(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999) 
15.32.220 - Appeals to the court. 
    Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board. 
(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999)

2.  Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses. 
3.  If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Except as provided in subsection (A)(2) of this section, any use which has been conditional use or variance shall be considered a conforming use. 
(Adopted by Ord. 868, 1999)

Chapter 15.36 - ABATEMENT OF DANGEROUS BUILDINGS CODE 

15.36.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to adopt the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings by reference, and to establish procedures for the administration and enforcement thereof, all subject to the modifications hereinafter set forth. 
(Ord. 831 § 1 (part), 1996) 
15.36.020 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known as "The Algona, Iowa, Abatement of Dangerous Buildings Code," and may be cited as such and will be referred to in this chapter as "this chapter." 
(Ord. 831 § 1 (part), 1996) 
15.36.030 - Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings-Adopted. 
    Pursuant to published notice and public hearing, as required by law, the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, 1997 Edition, published by the International Conference of Building Officials is adopted in full except for such portions as may hereinafter be deleted, modified or amended. 
(Ord. 898 § 13, 2002: Ord. 831 § 1 (part), 1996) 
15.36.040 - Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings-Certified copies on file. 
    An official copy of the aforementioned Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings and a certified copy of the ordinance codified in this chapter are on file in the office of the city clerk. 
(Ord. 831 § 1 (part), 1996) 
15.36.050 - Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings-Additions, amendments and deletions. 
    The following amendments, modifications, additions and deletions to the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, 1994 Edition, are made: 
A.  Administration. Section 201.1 is amended by adding at the end of said section the following new paragraph: 
The building official for the City of Algona, Iowa, is the Director of Public Works or his or her designee. The health officer for the City of Algona, Iowa, is the Director of Public Works or his or her designee. The fire marshal for the City of Algona, Iowa, is the Fire Chief or his or her designee. 
B.  Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. Section 202 is deleted and in its place is put the following: 
All buildings or portions thereof which are determined after inspection by the building official to be dangerous as defined in this code are hereby declared to be public nuisances and may be abated by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or removal in accordance with the procedure specified in Section 401 of this code. Other legal remedies available to the building official for the City of Algona may also be pursued.

The Algona City Council has the power not only to interpret the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings, but also to waive any provisions of the code as determined by majority vote. The power of the City Council to waive provisions of the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings does not permit the Council to impose rules or regulations not listed in the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings without the normal amending procedure required by law when an ordinance is amended. The City Council may, however, impose specific rules and agreements negotiated with an appellant concerning only the aspects of a specific building as covered by a specific appeal. Granting of a waiver either with or without additional rules or regulations does not obligate the Algona City Council to make the same agreement with any other appellant. Each and every appeal will be considered separately on its own merits.

 2. Any building declared a dangerous building under this code shall be made to comply with one of the following: 
 2.1. The building shall be repaired in accordance with the current building code when practicable, or other current code, when practicable, applicable to the type of substandard conditions requiring repair; or 
 2.2. The building shall be demolished.

A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to all parties upon request and upon payment of the fee charged by the court reporter for said transcript. 
G.  Compliance-General. Section 701.1 is deleted and in its place is put the following: 
After any order of the building official or the board of appeals made pursuant to this code have become final, no person to whom any such order is directed shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey any such order. Any such person who fails to comply with any such order shall be in violation of the Algona Municipal Code and shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 1.12 of the Algona Municipal Code. 
H.  Contest. Section 906 is deleted and in its place is put the following:

Once the City Council has made its decision on the report given by the Director of Public Works and the charges to be assessed, the City Clerk shall mail a statement to the property owner setting forth the amount that is due and owing. If the amount shown by the statement has not been paid within thirty (30) days from the date it is mailed, and the City Council has directed that the charge be assessed against the property, the City Clerk shall then certify the costs to the County Treasurer and it shall then be collected with, and in the same manner, as general property taxes. In addition, interest shall be due and payable as provided by law. 
15.36.060 - Violation-Penalty. 
    A violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall constitute a municipal infraction subject to the penalties and alternative relief authorized by Chapter 1.12 of this code or by Section 364.22 of the Code of Iowa, as amended. 
    In the alternative, any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter may be subject, upon conviction, to imprisonment not exceeding thirty days or a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars. 
    Each day's violation shall be deemed a separate violation of this chapter.

For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text has been used to conform to the Code of Ordinances.

    Within the districts established by this chapter there exist: 
1.  Lots; 
2.  Structures; 
3.  Uses of land and structures; and 
4.  Characteristics of use; 
which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which are prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Further nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district; however, it is the intent of this chapter to allow structures which were nonconforming under the previous ordinance, but which are conforming under this chapter to be considered legal as of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and shall be allowed to be rebuilt, added to, or modified within the terms and requirements of this chapter. 
    To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
17.04.070 - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of the ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, if the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through the action of the board of adjustment. 
17.04.080 - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only). 
    Where at the time of passage of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
1.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
2.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
3.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of six months, then any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located. 
4.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
17.04.090 - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in such a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
2.  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than sixty percent of its market value at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed unless granted a special exception by the board of adjustment, and then such reconstruction shall only be allowed on the same perimeter location. 
3.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
17.04.100 - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. 
    If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of one thousand dollars or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions. 
1.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
2.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance form which this chapter is derived, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
3.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. 
4.  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
5.  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for twelve consecutive months or for eighteen months during any three year period (except when government action impedes access to the premises) the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
6.  When nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than sixty percent of the market value at time of destruction. 
17.04.110 - Repairs and maintenance. 
    On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall not be increased. 
17.04.120 - Uses under special exception provisions not nonconforming uses. 
    Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms of this chapter (other than a change through board of adjustment action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the Cable System into any portion of the Service Area where another operator is providing Cable Service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the present Service Area of the Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing. 
3.10 Subscriber Charges for Extensions of the Cable System. No Subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the density requirements of subsection 3.9 above, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the Cable System to Subscriber(s) in that area if the Subscriber(s) are willing to share the capital costs of extending the Cable System. Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet from the Grantee's trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 5. Subscribers who request service hereunder shall bear the remaining cost to extend the Cable System on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential Subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible for any Standard/non-Standard Installation charges to extend the Cable System from the tap to the residence. 
3.11 Cable Service to Public Buildings. The Grantee, upon request, shall provide without charge, a Standard Installation and one outlet of Basic Cable to those administrative buildings owned and occupied by the Franchising Authority, fire station(s), police station(s), and K-12 public school(s) that are passed by its Cable System. The Cable Service provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed outlet without authorization from the Grantee. The Cable Service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes, and such outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public. The Franchising Authority shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any inappropriate use of the Grantee's Cable System or any loss or damage to Grantee's Cable System. The Franchising Authority shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of Cable Service required by this subsection. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a non-Standard Installation is required, unless the Franchising Authority or building owner/occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary Cable System extension and/or non-Standard Installation. If additional outlets of Basic Cable are provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the usual installation and service fees associated therewith. 
3.12 Emergency Alert. Any Emergency Alert System ("EAS") provided by Grantee shall be operated in accordance with FCC regulations. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the Franchising Authority will hold the Grantee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of use of the EAS, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. 
3.13 Public, Education and Government Access. 
A.  Grantee shall continue to provide the Franchising Authority with one (1) Access channel on the Cable System designated for public, educational and governmental access purposes. 
B.  The Access channel is made available to the Franchising Authority by the Grantee for the purpose of cablecasting non-commercial programming by City residents, City administration and educational institutions. The Franchising Authority agrees not to use the Access channel to provide commercial or revenue-generating services or services that may compete, directly or indirectly, with services provided by the Company, and provided, however, that the Franchising Authority may cablecast acknowledgments of funding sources and the underwriting of programming costs. 
C.  Whenever the Access channel as required by this section is in use for more than fifty (50) percent of prime time (as defined in Section 76.5(n) of the FCC Rules and Regulations) and more than fifty (50) percent outside of the prime time over a three-month period, with at least fifty (50) percent of the programming being original and not duplicated, and there is demand for use of additional channels for the same purpose, the Grantee shall have six (6) months to make an additional channel available for the same purpose, provided, however, that said Access channel does not interfere with existing use of the channel capacity on the Cable System. In no event shall the Grantee be required to provide more than three (3) access channels. 
D.  The Grantee shall provide ongoing capital support for Public, Educational and Governmental Access facilities in an amount equal to thirty cents ($.30) per Subscriber per month for the entire term of this franchise. The ongoing capital access support shall be due and payable 60 days after the close of the preceding quarterly period. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report showing the basis for the computation. The Grantee may identify the amount as a separate line item on each Subscriber's monthly bill to the extent permitted by federal law. Payments of this ongoing capital support shall not be deemed to be "franchise fees" within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable Act, and such payment shall not be deemed to be (i) "payments-in-kind" or any involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid the Franchising Authority by Grantee pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof, or (ii) part of the compensation to be paid to the Franchising Authority pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof. 
E.  The Grantee shall have the right, at its own expense, to cablecast Public, Educational and Governmental Access programming locally originated by the Access facilities in the Service Area on Cable Systems owned or operated by the Grantee, its parent company or subsidiaries of its parent company outside of the Service Area.

4.3 Renewal of Franchise. The Franchising Authority and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the Franchising Authority that relate to the renewal of the Grantee's Franchise shall be governed by and comply with the renewal provisions of state and federal law. 
4.4 Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of the Grantee's Franchise is denied or the Franchise is lawfully terminated, and the Franchising Authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the Cable System or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act. 
    The Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the Franchise, the Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its Cable System to a qualified third party. Furthermore, the Grantee shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior Franchise during this period; however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six (6) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its Cable System which is reasonably acceptable to the Franchising Authority, the Grantee and the Franchising Authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law. It is further agreed that the Grantee's continued operation of the Cable System during the six (6) month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the Franchising Authority or the Grantee. 
4.5 Transfer of Franchise. The Grantee's right, title, or interest in the Franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Grantee, without prior consent of the Franchising Authority, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the Grantee in the Franchise or Cable System in order to secure indebtedness. Within 30 days of receiving the request for transfer, the Franchising Authority shall, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of the information it requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee. If the Franchising Authority has not taken action on the Grantee's request for transfer within 120 days after receiving such request, consent by the Franchising Authority shall be deemed given. 
SECTION 5 
Compliance and Monitoring 
5.1 Testing for Compliance. The Franchising Authority may perform technical tests of the Cable System during reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operation of the Grantee or the Cable System in order to determine whether or not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable state or federal laws. Except in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two business days, and providing a representative of the Grantee an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially complied with such material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the Franchising Authority. Except in emergency circumstances, the Franchising Authority agrees that such testing shall be undertaken no more than once a year, and that the results thereof shall be made available to the Grantee. 
5.2 Books and Records. The Grantee agrees that the Franchising Authority, upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Grantee and no more than once annually may review such of its books and records at the Grantee's business office, during normal business hours and on a nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this Franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the subsection of the Franchise which is under review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the Franchising Authority. Alternatively, if the books and records are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of the Franchising Authority's representative to view the books and records at the appropriate location. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate which is not providing Cable Service in the Service Area. The Franchising Authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required to provide Subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act. 
SECTION 6 
Insurance and Indemnification 
6.1 Insurance Requirements. The Grantee shall maintain insurance in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the Franchise, Comprehensive General Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage. The Grantee shall provide a Certificate of Insurance designating the Franchising Authority as an additional insured and such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Franchising Authority. 
6.2 Indemnification. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the Franchising Authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death), which arise out of the Grantee's construction, operation, or maintenance of its Cable System in the Service Area provided that the Franchising Authority shall give the Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify the Franchising Authority within twenty (20) days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this subsection. No notice shall be required where the Grantee has actual notice of its obligation to indemnify the Franchising Authority. If the Franchising Authority determines that it is necessary for it to employ separate counsel, the costs for such separate counsel shall be the responsibility of the Franchising Authority, provided however, that if a conflict of interest exists between the Franchising Authority and the Grantee, the grantee will remain responsible for the costs of separate counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify the Franchising Authority for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of the Franchising Authority. 
SECTION 7 
Enforcement and Termination of Franchise 
7.1 Notice of Violation. In the event that the Franchising Authority believes that the Grantee has not complied with the any material term of the Franchise, the Franchising Authority shall informally discuss the matter with Grantee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem, the Franchising Authority shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact nature of such alleged noncompliance. 
7.2 The Grantee's Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice described in subsection 7.1: (A) to respond to the Franchising Authority, contesting the assertion of such noncompliance, or (B) to cure such default, or (C) in the event that, by the nature of such default, it cannot be cured within the thirty (30) day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the Franchising Authority of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. 
7.3 Failure To Cure. In the event that the Grantee fails to remedy the alleged default within thirty (30) days or the date projected pursuant to 7.2(C) above, the Franchising Authority may enforce the Franchise as provided in Section 7.4 hereunder, or as otherwise provided under federal or state law. 
7.4 Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the Franchising Authority determines that the Grantee is in material default of any provision of the Franchise, the Franchising Authority may: 
A. Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; 
B. Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or 
C. In the case of a substantial default of a material term or terms of the Franchise, declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked in accordance with the following: 
The Franchising Authority shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent to revoke the Franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. Such appeal must be taken within 30 days of the issuance of the determination of the Franchising Authority. The Franchising Authority and the Grantee may toll the 30 day appeal period by written agreement. 
D. The Franchising Authority may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the Franchising Authority's rights under the Franchise in lieu of revocation of the Franchise. 
E. The Grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the terms and conditions of this Franchise Agreement by any failure of the Franchising Authority upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any such terms or conditions. 
7.5 Impossibility of Performance. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages or other events reasonably beyond its ability to control. 
7.6 Rights Reserved to the Franchising Authority. Without limitation upon the rights which the Franchising Authority might otherwise have, the Franchising Authority does hereby expressly reserve the following rights, powers and authorities: 
A. To exercise its governmental powers now or hereafter to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the said Franchising Authority; 
B. To determine through its City Council any question of fact relating to the meaning, terms, obligations, or other factors of this franchise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Grantee shall at all times have the right to appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction, such determinations made by the City Council; 
C. To grant additional franchises within the Service Area to other persons for the operation of a Cable System; 
D. To exercise any other rights, powers or duties required or authorized to the Franchising Authority under the Constitution of the state of Iowa, the laws of Iowa, the City Ordinances of the City of Algona or under the Constitution, laws or regulations of the United States of America, now enacted or subsequently adopted. 
E. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to authorize the Franchising Authority, through the use of its ordinances, to unilaterally amend or modify this franchise agreement. 
7.7 Customer Service Standards. The Grantee will adhere to the Customer Service Obligations as set forth in Title 47, CFR, Part 76, Subpart H, Section 76.309.

In any action by the Franchising Authority or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
8.2 Entire Agreement . This Franchise constitutes the entire agreement between the Grantee and the Franchising Authority and supersedes all other prior understandings and agreements oral or written. Any amendments to this Franchise shall be mutually agreed to in writing by the parties.
