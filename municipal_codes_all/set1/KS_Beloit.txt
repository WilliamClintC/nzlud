2-105.        Dangerous dogs; definitions.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(a)   Dangerous dog means:

(1)   Any dog with a known propensity, tendency or disposition to attack, to cause injury, or otherwise threaten the safety of human beings or domestic animals;

(2)   Any dog which in a vicious or threatening manner approaches any person in an apparent attack upon the person while on the streets, sidewalks, or any public grounds or places;

(3)   Any dog which has attacked, bitten, or seriously physically harmed a human being;

(4)   Any dog which has attacked or bitten a domestic animal in an aggressive, vicious or threatening manner; or

(5)   Any dog owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of dog fighting, or any dog trained for dog fighting.

       Notwithstanding this definition of a dangerous dog, no dog may be declared dangerous if any injury or damage is sustained by a person or animal who at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the dog, or was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. No dog may be declared dangerous if an injury or damage was sustained by a person if the dog was responding to pain or injury; protecting itself, its kennel or its offspring; protecting or defending another human being within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault; or involved in playful actions resulting in an unintentional bite wound. No dog may be declared dangerous if an injury or damage was sustained by a domestic animal which, at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to regulate or prohibit the lawful maintenance of dogs by law enforcement agencies.

(b)   It shall be unlawful for any person to own, possess, keep, or harbor a dog that such person knows, or reasonably should know, to be a dangerous dog, unless the owner, keeper or harborer complies with the requirements of Section 2-107. Any person who keeps, harbors, controls, acts as a custodian of, or knowingly permits an animal to remain on or about any premises shall be deemed to own or possess the animal.

(c)   Upon the occurrence of any event described in Section 2-105(a), the Animal Control Officer shall declare the dog as a dangerous dog as defined by this article.

(Ord. 1992; Ord. 2224; Ord. 2234; Ord. 2274)

2-106.        Dangerous dogs, appeal; administrative hearing.

(a)   Any owner/custodian aggrieved by any decision, ruling, action, or finding by the City with respect to a determination of whether a dog is a dangerous dog as defined by this article may, within 10 days thereafter, file a written notice of appeal from the decision, ruling action, or finding to the municipal court for an administrative hearing thereon.

(b)   The filing of an appeal under this subsection shall not stay any action taken pursuant to this article.

(c)   The hearing on the appeal shall be conducted by the judge of the municipal court who shall act as an administrative judge for the purposes of this article. Notice of the hearing shall be issued within three (3) days of receipt of the notice of appeal and shall be mailed by certified mail or personally served upon the dog owner/custodian at the last known placed of residence. The hearing shall be held promptly within not less than five (5) nor more ten (10) days after mailing notice to the owner/custodian of the dog. The sole issue for determination shall be whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the animal is a dangerous dog as defined by this article. The Court shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law in each case.

(d)   In making a determination of whether a dog is dangerous, the municipal judge may consider, but is not limited to the consideration of any one or all of the following factors:

(1)   The seriousness and nature of any attack, bite or physical injury of a human being or domestic animal;

(2)   Whether the dog has any history of attacking or biting a human being or domestic animal;

(3)   Whether the dog has chased or approached a person upon any public or private property in an apparent attitude of attack;

(4)   Whether the dog behaves in a manner that a reasonable person would believe poses an unjustified imminent threat of serious injury or death to a human being or domestic animal;

(5)   Whether the dog has a known propensity, tendency or disposition to attack or bite unprovoked, causing injury or otherwise threatening the safety of humans or domestic animals;

(6)   Whether the dog has been previously determined, declared or adjudicated to be dangerous or vicious by the city and which jurisdiction uses substantially the same standards as the city for determination of a dangerous or vicious animal;

(7)   The likelihood of attacks or bites in the future;

(8)   The conditions or circumstances existing at the time of the approach, attack or bite, including, but not limited to:

(A)  Whether the dog was provoked;

(B)  Whether the victim was committing a willful trespass or other tort or was committing or attempting to commit a crime upon the premises occupied by the owner of the dog; or

(C)  Whether the dog was protecting or defending a human being or another animal within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault.

(9)   The conditions under which the dog is kept, enclosed or confined; and

(10) The status of the dog's license and vaccination as required by the Beloit City Code.

(e)   Pursuant to its role as administrative judge, the court is empowered to subpoena witnesses, take testimony , and require the production of any evidence relating to any matter being heard. The failure of the owner, custodian, keeper or harborer to attend or participate in the hearing shall not prevent the judge from making the appropriate determination concerning the dog.

(f)   Any aggrieved party may appeal the decision and findings of the Municipal Court Judge pursuant to K.S.A. 60-2101(d). However, the filing of an appeal under this subsection shall not stay any action taken pursuant to this article.

(g)   While the appeal is pending, if the Animal Control Officer has probable cause to believe the dog in question may pose a threat of serious harm to human beings or other domestic animals, the dog may be impounded pending the determination by the judge. If the judge deems the animal dangerous, the owner/custodian shall be liable to the city for the costs and expenses of keeping such dog.

If a dog is dangerous by definition, is declared dangerous by the Animal Control Officer, or the municipal court judge determines that a dog is dangerous pursuant to this article, the owner or keeper of the dangerous dog shall be required to comply with the following:

(a)   Registration. The owner or keeper shall annually register the dangerous dog with the city, on such forms designated by the city clerk. The owner or keeper shall pay a $50.00 annual license fee. The owner or keeper shall be responsible for maintaining with the city clerk the address of the owner or keeper and the dangerous dog. The owner or keeper shall notify the city clerk within seven days of a change in address for the owner or keeper and dangerous dog, or the removal from the city limits or death, loss or theft of a registered dangerous dog.

(b)   Confinement. All dangerous dogs shall be securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen or kennel outdoors. Said enclosure shall be a fence or structure at least six feet in height, with a secure top suitable to confine a dangerous dog and shall meet the minimum size requirements in Section 2-402(c)(2). If such enclosure bas no bottom secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the ground no less than one foot. No dangerous dog may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or structure that would allow the dog to exit such building on its own volition. It is unlawful for any owner or keeper to maintain a dangerous dog upon any premises that does not have a locked enclosure. It is unlawful for any owner or keeper to allow a dangerous dog to be outside of the dwelling of the owner or keeper or outside the enclosure unless it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the dangerous dog or for the limited purposes of allowing the dangerous dog to urinate or defecate or to sell or give away the dangerous dog or respond to such orders of law enforcement officials as may be required. In such event, the dangerous dog shall be securely muzzled and restrained with a leash not exceeding four feet in length, and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the dangerous dog. No person shall permit a dangerous dog to be kept on a chain, rope or other type of leash outside its kennel or pen. Such dogs may not be leashed to inanimate objects such as trees, posts or buildings. The muzzle shall be made and used in a manner that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration, but shall prevent it from biting any human or animal.

(c)   Microchipping. All dangerous dogs shall have an identification microchip implanted in the dog which is compatible with local veterinarian detection equipment. The applicant shall provide proof of microchipping at the time application or reapplication is made for a dangerous dog license.

(d)   Signage. All owners of dangerous dogs shall display in a prominent place on their premises a sign easily readable by the public using the words “Beware of Dog”. In addition, a similar sign is required to be posted on the kennel or pen of such animal.

(e)   Identification Photos. All owners of dangerous dogs shall provide a current photo of the dog being registered during the registration process for identification purposes.

(f)   Spayed/Neutered. The dangerous dog shall be spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian. The application or reapplication for a dangerous dog license shall include documentation showing that the dog has been spayed or neutered.

(g)   Insurance. Any owner of a dangerous dog shall maintain liability insurance in the single-incident in the amount of $100,000.00 for bodily injury or death of any person(s), or for damage to property which may result from actions of the dangerous dog, or from action or inactions of the owner related to the dangerous dog.

The purpose of the requirements in this article governing dangerous dogs is to prevent attacks, injuries or death by mandating use of control methods. It is the affirmative duty of any owner of a dangerous dog to take all necessary steps to comply with this article. Any dog found to be the subject of a violation of this article shall be subject to immediate seizure and impoundment. If the dog is not immediately seized and impounded, the officer shall instruct the owner to keep said dog confined in a securely closed and locked pen or kennel until such time as the court may order seizure and impoundment. Neither the owner, nor any other person may remove said dog from said secure pen or kennel without the written permission of either the animal control officer or judge of the municipal court. Failure to comply with any provision of this article shall also be considered good cause for the revocation of any license issued allowing for the keeping of the subject dog, resulting in the immediate removal from the city by the owner, or the impoundment of the dog.

(Ord. 2224; Ord. 2234; Ord. 2274)

2-113.        Vicious dogs, definitions.

The city hereby finds that certain dogs, because of a combination of their physical attributes and disposition or training for aggression, fighting or attack, pose a clear and present threat to public safety. Although relatively few in number, such dogs represent a threat to all persons, particularly those persons who cannot protect and defend themselves, such as children and the elderly. Regardless of the procedures taken to confine such dogs, their mere presence creates an unacceptable risk to the public because such dogs may escape or be released at any time. Because of the clear and present threat to public safety, such dogs are found to be a public nuisance. As a result, the city hereby prohibits the ownership and possession of these vicious dogs within the city limits of the city and imposes related regulations, as set forth in this article.

Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

Vicious dog means:

(a)   Any dog which:

(1)   Kills a human being;

(2)   Inflicts severe injury to a human being through a sustained or vicious attack;

(5)   Has the propensity, tendency or disposition to attack a human being without provocation and possesses physical attributes such as size, build, or bite strength to inflict severe injury to a human being.

(b)   Exceptions. No dog shall be deemed or declared a vicious dog:

(1)   Solely because it inflicted severe injury on a human being if the human being was, at the time the severe injury was sustained:

(A)  Assaulting the owner or possessor of the dog; provided, the owner or possessor of the dog was not the aggressor;

(B)  Committing a willful trespass upon the premises of the owner or possessor of the dog; or

(a)   Vicious Dogs as Public Nuisance. Vicious dogs are declared to be a public nuisance and are hereby prohibited within the city.

(b)   Ownership or Possession of Vicious Dog. It is unlawful to own or possess a vicious dog in the city. An owner or possessor of a dog that falls within the definition of “vicious dog” shall be strictly liable under this article and a conviction shall not require proof of any criminal intent or the owner or possessor’s knowledge of any particular propensity, tendency or disposition of the dog. Each vicious dog owned or possessed in violation of this article shall constitute a separate offense.

(c)   Ownership or Possession of Dog Following Conviction.

The court may enter such an order as part of a criminal proceeding brought pursuant to Section 2-117 or in a separate civil proceeding brought for such purpose and, in either event, shall impose against the owner or possessor of the vicious dog the expenses of impounding, keeping, and euthanizing the vicious dog. The owner or possessor shall be notified (at the owner or possessor’s last known address) at least five days in advance of the date and time of any evidentiary hearing pursuant to this article and may present contrary evidence at such hearing. The failure of the owner or possessor to attend or participate in the hearing, however, shall not prevent the court from making an appropriate determination concerning the dog.

(Ord. 2224; Ord. 2274)

2-116.        Vicious dogs, impoundment.

(a)   Generally. When the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee has probable cause to believe that any dog is a vicious dog, such officer may, in his discretion, take custody of the dog and impound it until such time as evidence shall be heard and a determination made as to whether the dog is a vicious dog; provided that if the owner or possessor of the dog is not known, the dog may be disposed of pursuant to other applicable law. The dog may be impounded at a licensed veterinary clinic or other location that the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee permits and which is consistent with applicable state impoundment laws. A warrant may be obtained to allow the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee or any other law enforcement officer to go onto any property and take custody of any dog for which there is probable cause to believe it is a vicious dog. In addition, the court may, through its contempt power, compel the owner or possessor of any dog to surrender it to the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee. In the event any dog is found to be a vicious dog, the owner or possessor of such dog shall be responsible for payment of any expenses of impounding and keeping the dog, pending disposition of the case and expenses of euthanizing the dog.

(b)   Discretionary Testing of Suspected Vicious Dog. Whenever any dog is impounded pursuant to this article based upon probable cause to believe that the dog is a vicious dog under the term “vicious dog” of Section 2-113(a)(3), (a)(4) or (a)(5), the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee may, in his discretion, cause any person who is knowledgeable in identifying dogs trained to fight, or who is trained or certified at evaluating animal temperament, to examine the dog and render an opinion as to whether the dog is a vicious dog under the term “vicious dog” of Section 2-113(a)(3), (a)(4) or (a)(5), with the person examining and rendering the opinion to be chosen at by the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee requesting the examination.

(c)   Unauthorized Removal of Impounded Dogs, Actual or Attempted. No person shall remove or attempt to remove a dog from the custody of the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee or any animal shelter at which the dog is impounded, whether by force, threat, deceit or otherwise, when such dog has been impounded under the provisions of this article or any other law, unless the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee or a court of appropriate jurisdiction expressly authorizes the release of the dog.

(d)   Post-impoundment Review. Within ten days of impounding a vicious dog pursuant to this section without a warrant, the court shall review documentary evidence substantiating the animal control officer, law enforcement, or designee’s probable cause to determine whether the dog is a vicious dog. If the court determines that the evidence is not sufficient to establish probable cause that the dog is a vicious dog and the dog’s owner or possessor is known, the dog shall be released to its owner or possessor as soon as practical.

(Ord. 2224; Ord. 2274)

2-117.        Vicious dogs, criminal penalties.

18-411.      Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this article its most reasonable application.

(a)   Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The land within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This land is identified as Zone A on the official map.

(b)   Development. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to building or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.

(c)   Flood. A temporary rise in stream’s flow or stage that results in water overflowing its banks and inundating areas adjacent to the channel or an unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any source.

(d)   Floodproofing. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, including utility and sanitary facilities, which would preclude the entry of water. Structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.

(e)   Lowest Floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this article.

(f)   Manufactured Home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain management purposes the term manufactured home also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term manufactured home does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.

(g)   Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale.

(h)   Regulatory Flood Elevation. The water surface elevation of the 100-year flood.

(i)    Start of Construction. For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation of the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include the excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

(j)    Structure. A walled and roofed structure, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above the ground, including but without limitations to buildings, factories, sheds, cabins, manufactured homes and other similar uses.

(k)   Substantial Improvement. Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either (a) before the improvement is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations as well as structures listed in national or state registers of historic places.

(l)    100-Year Flood. The condition of flooding having a one percent chance of annual occurrence.

ARTICLE 5. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT GENERAL PROVISIONS

18-501.      Statutory authorization.

The legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq. and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 1)

18-502.      Findings of facts.

(a)   Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards. disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

(b)   General Causes of these Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by

(1)   The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities;

(2)   the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 1)

18-503.      Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 18-702(a); to establish or maintain the community’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this article to:

(a)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increase in flood heights or velocities;

(b)   Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and

(c)   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes due to the flood hazard.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 1)

18-504.      Lands to which article applies.

This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) dated August 19, 1986, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in section 18-712:715.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 2)

18-505.      Compliance.

No development located within known flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 2)

18-506.      Abrogation and greater restrictions.

It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easement, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this article shall prevail.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 2)

18-507.      Interpretation.

In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 2)

18-508.      Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural cases, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside unnumbered A zones or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 2)

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 5)

18-519.      Floodplain management variance criteria.

In passing upon such applications for variances, the appeal board shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and the following criteria:

(a)   the danger to life and property due to flood damage;

(b)   the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(c)   the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

(d)   the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(e)   the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

(f)   the availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use;

(g)   the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(h)   the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(i)    the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(j)    the expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and,

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 5)

18-520.      Conditions for approving floodplain management variances.

(a)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b) through (f) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increased beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(b)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure’s continued historic designation.

(c)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood discharge would result.

(d)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(e)   Variances shall only be issued upon

(1)   a showing of good and sufficient cause,

(2)   a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and

(3)   a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(f)   A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that

(1)   the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and

(2)   such construction below the base flood level increases risk to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article.

(Ord. 1905, Sec. 5)

18-521.      Conditions for approving variances for agricultural structures.

Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building’s unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in sections 18-519:520.

In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade arid wet-flood proofed.

(a)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the floodplain management regulations of this article shall demonstrate that the varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the agricultural structure. Residential structures, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.

In the event of an emergency, the Company shall have the right to commence work without having first providing such forms(s).

In its letter of acceptance, Company shall identify the effective date as set forth above and Company shall begin charging its customers for those fees set forth in Section 2 above on that date.

I.     Upon written request of either the City or the Company, the franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time upon any of the following events:

(b)   Change in the structure or operation of the natural gas industry which materially affects any rights or obligations of either the City or Company, including, but no limited to, the scope of the grant to the Company or the compensation to be received by the City.

(c)   Any other material and unintended change or shift in the economic benefit to the City or the Company relied upon and anticipated upon entering into this franchise.

II.    The compensation provision of this franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated at any time if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other suppliers of energy through pipelines, and use the public rights of way or public property of the City without paying a franchise fee or other payment substantially equivalent to the franchise fee established herein, which results in a material and unfair disadvantage to the Company. The use of right of provision of this franchise shall be reopened and renegotiated if energy consumers within the City have access to alternative natural gas suppliers or other City, and do not have requirements on the use of the public ways substantially equivalent to the requirements of this franchise, which results in a material and unfair disadvantage to the Company. Upon any such event, the City shall have up to ninety (90) days after written request of the Company to restore competitive neutrality. Following such notice to the City, Company may suspend collection and payment of the franchise fee to the City for the affected customers until the City resolves the competitive disadvantage.

(c)   The Company shall maintain and file with the City updated maps, in such form as may be reasonably required by the community development director, providing the location and sufficient detail of all existing and new facilities in the rights-of-way, and such other related information as may be reasonably required by the public works director of all users of the rights-of-way.

(j)    The City encourages the conservation of the rights-of-way by the sharing of space by all utilities. Notwithstanding provisions of this franchise prohibiting third party use, to the extent required by federal or state law, the Company may permit any other franchised entity by an appropriate grant, or a contract, or agreement negotiated by the parties, to use any and all facilities constructed or erected by the Company.

b. The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way. This Contract franchise does not:

(1) Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;

(2) Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or,

(3) Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on property or facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third- party.

c. As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC). Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property).

d. Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City.

e. Access to the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law.

SECTION 3. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.

a. Pursuant to K.S.A. 17-1902 and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract franchise, Grantee has the right to construct, maintain and operate its Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public right-of-way. Such Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities.

b. Grantee's use of the Public right-of-way shall be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way.

c. City shall, pursuant to Section 13 of this Contract franchise, provide reasonable advanced notice of the consideration and/or adoption of any rule, regulation, policies, resolutions and ordinances relating to the construction in or use of the Public right-of-way, inasmuch as such adoption affects Grantee's use of the Public right-of-way.

d. If requested by the City, in order to accomplish construction and maintenance activities directly related to improvements for the health, safety and welfare of the public, Grantee shall remove, relocate or adjust its Facilities within the Public right-of-way at no cost to the City, providing such request similarly binds all users of such public right-of-way. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible within the time set forth in any written request by the City for such relocation or adjustment, provided that the City shall provide Grantee with a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days advance written notice to comply with any such removal, relocation or adjustment. Grantee shall designate one (1) person within its organization by his/her employment position to whom relocation notices shall be sent and with whom rests the responsibility to facilitate all necessary communications within Grantee's various areas.

Grantee shall not be obligated to commence the removal, relocation or adjustment until receipt of funds for the costs from such private party or parties. For purposes of this paragraph, a mixed purpose public/private project shall be subject to a presumption of a private benefit of no less than 50 percent. Further, Grantee shall have no liability for delays caused by a private party's failure to reimburse costs. Grantee understands, however, that the City has no obligation to collect such reimbursement.

f. Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program.

SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.

a. In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed the maximum Access line fee allowed by Kansas law. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back; provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.

b. Every 36 months, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12- 2001(m) and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001 and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee.

c. Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.

d. Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City a certified statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated.

e. No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is not in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any :franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto. Subject to. any limitations of Kansas Statute, Grantee's payment obligations shall survive the expiration or termination of this Contract franchise.

f. The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.

g. The franchise fee required herein pursuant to K.S.A. 12-200l(i), shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under K.S.A. 12-2001 and K.S.A. 17-1902 and amendments thereto. The franchise fee shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.

h. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or a gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance. Such Access line (franchise) fee or Gross Receipts (franchise) fee shall be in the same amount or percentage as the franchise fee set forth in subsection 4a.hereinabove.

SECTION 5. ANNEXATION OR RENUMBERING STREETS

The City agrees to provide Grantee with notification in the event that it annexes property into the corporate boundaries of the City that would require Grantee to collect and pay a franchise fee on access lines or gross receipts which prior to the annexation of the property Grantee was not required to pay a franchise fee. The City agrees to provide Grantee with notification in the event the City renumbers or renames any streets that would require Grantee to collect and pay a franchise fee on access lines or gross receipts which prior to the renumbering or renaming of the streets Grantee would not have been required to pay a franchise fee. The City agrees that in the event the City does not provide Grantee with notice of an annexation or renumbering and/or renaming of the streets, Grantee is not liable to the City for payment of franchise fees on the annexation or renumbered and/or renamed streets prior to the City providing notice to Grantee of such.

SECTION 6. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.

a. It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, KS.A. 66-180 et. seq., and amendments thereto, it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee's Facilities.

b. Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee or subcontractor of Grantee, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.

c. The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall in any way obligate Grantee for the negligence of any other third party or any portion of any harm caused by the same.

d. Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee's or the City's activities in the Public right-of-way.

The failure of either the City or Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

CHAPTER 1. ADMINISTRATION

SECTION 101 GENERAL

101.1     Title. These regulations shall be known as the Zoning Code or Zoning Regulations of the City of Beloit, Kansas, hereinafter referred to as “this code.”

101.2     Intent. The purpose of this code is to safeguard the health, property and public welfare by controlling the design, location, use or occupancy of all buildings and structures through the regulated and orderly development of land and land uses within this jurisdiction.

101.3     Scope. The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction, addition, alteration, moving, repair and use of any building, structure, parcel of land or sign within a jurisdiction, except work located primarily in a public way, public utility towers and poles, and public utilities unless specifically mentioned in this code.

       Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code specify different requirements, the more restrictive shall govern. Where there is conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable.

       In fulfilling these purposes, this ordinance is intended to benefit the public as a whole and not any specific person or class of persons. Although, through the implementation, administration and enforcement of this code, benefits and detriments will be enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals, such is merely a byproduct of the overall benefit to the whole community. Therefore, unintentional breaches of the obligations of administration and enforcement imposed on the jurisdiction hereby shall not be enforceable in tort.

       If any portion of this code is held invalid for any reason, the remaining herein shall not be affected.

SECTION 103 EXISTING BUILDINGS AND USES

103.1     General. Lawfully established buildings and uses in existence at the time of the adoption of this code shall be permitted to have their existing use or occupancy continued, provided such continued use is not dangerous to life.

103.2     Additions, alterations or repairs. Additions, alterations or repairs shall be permitted to be made to any building or use without requiring the existing building or use to comply with the requirements of this code, provided the addition, alteration or repair conforms to that required for a new building or use.

103.3     Maintenance. All buildings or uses, both existing and new, and all parts thereof, shall be maintained. The owner or designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings and parcels of land. To determine compliance with this section, the code official shall be permitted to cause any structure or use to be inspected.

103.4     Moved and temporary buildings, structures, and uses. Buildings or structures moved into or within the jurisdictions shall comply with the provisions of this code for new buildings and structures.

       Temporary buildings, structures and uses such as reviewing stands and other miscellaneous structures, sheds, canopies or fences used for the protection of the public shall be permitted to be erected, provided a special approval is received from the code official for a limited period of time. Temporary buildings or structures shall be completely removed upon the expiration of the time limit stated in the permit.

103.5     Illegal uses. Uses that were illegally established prior to the adoption of this code shall remain illegal.

SECTION 104 DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE ZONING CODE OFFICIAL

104.1     General. This section establishes the duties and responsibilities for the zoning code official and other officials and agencies, with respect to the administration of this code. The zoning code official and/or designee shall be referred to hereafter as “the code official.”

104.5.1   Review of building permits. All applications for building permits and amendments thereto shall be submitted to the code official for review and approved prior to permit issuance. Each application shall include a set of building plans and all data necessary to show that the requirements of this code are met.

104.5.2   Site plan reviews. The code official shall receive all applications for site plan review and review for completeness and prepare submittals for review by the appropriate body.

104.5.3   Conditional-use permits and variances. The code official shall receive all applications for conditional uses and variances or other plans as shall be permitted or approved as required by this code, review for completeness and prepare submittals for review by the appropriate body.

104.5.4   Amendments. All requests for amendments or changes to the comprehensive plan or this code or map shall be submitted to the code official for processing.

104.6     Interpretations. The interpretation and application of the provisions of this code shall be by the code official.

Mixed uses/sites or any use not specifically mentioned or about which there is any question shall be administratively classified by comparison with other uses identified in the zones described in this code. If the proposed use resembles identified uses in terms of intensity and character, and is consistent with the purpose of this code and the individual zone’s classification, it shall be considered as a permitted/non-permitted use within a general zone classification, subject to the regulations for the use it most nearly resembles. If a use does not resemble other identified allowable uses within a zone, it may be permitted as determined by the hearing body in public hearing as an amendment to this code pursuant to Section 109.3.

104.7     Liability. The code official, or designee, charged with the enforcement of this code, acting in good faith and without malice in the discharge of the duties described in this code, shall not be personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of an act or by reason of an act or omission in the discharge of such duties. A suit brought against the code official or employee because such act or omission performed by the code official or employee in the enforcement of any provision of such codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances implemented through the enforcement of this code or enforced by the enforcement agency shall be defended by the jurisdiction until final termination of such proceedings, and any judgment resulting therefrom shall be assumed by the jurisdiction.

       This code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person owning, operating or controlling any building or parcel of land for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the enforcement agency or its jurisdiction be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the reviews or permits issued under this code.

104.8     Cooperation of other officials and officers. The code official shall be authorized to request, and shall receive so far as is required in the discharge of the duties described in this code, the assistance and cooperation of other officials of the jurisdiction.

(1)   To authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms of the regulations which will not be contrary to the public interest and where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the regulations, in an individual case, results in unnecessary hardship, and provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the Board that all of the following conditions have been met:

(A)  That the variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant;

(B)  That the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;

(C)  That the strict application of the provisions of the zoning regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;

(D)  That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare; and

(E)   That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations (or code); and (2) to grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in those instances where the Board is specifically authorized to grant such exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an exception in the zoning regulation.

107.4     Use variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant a variance to allow the establishment of a use in a zoning district when such use is prohibited by the provisions of this code.

107.5     Decisions. The Board shall be permitted to decide in any manner it sees fit; however, it shall not have the authority to alter or change this code or zoning map or allow as a use that which would be inconsistent with the requirements of this Regulations. Provided, however, that in interpreting and applying the provisions of this code, the requirements shall be deemed to be the spirit and intent of the code and do not constitute the granting of a special privilege. Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any order or determination of the board may bring an action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the final decision of the board.

d.    If there is a difference, either real or apparent, between the Zoning Map(s) adopted by these Zoning Regulations and previous zoning map(s), regardless of whether the real or apparent differences appear or are found to be the result of errors or omissions, the Zoning Map(s) adopted with these Zoning Regulations shall prevail and establish the zoning for all real property.

SECTION 304 ANNEXED TERRITORY

Section 304.1        Land hereafter annexed into the City shall receive, upon annexation, the zoning district classification as set forth in this section, until such time procedures are followed and finalized to amend that zoning classification consistent with state law and these regulations.

SECTION 305 RULES WHERE UNCERTAINITY MAY ARISE

Section 305.1        It is the intent of these regulations that every part of the incorporated area of the City of Beloit, other than streets, highways and railroad lines, shall be included in one of the zoning districts established herein. The boundaries of the specific zoning districts are to scale on the zoning map and are to be interpreted by the corresponding measurements on the map. The following rules shall apply in the determination of the boundaries of any district shown on the Zoning Map.

a.    Whenever a lot is divided by a zoning district boundary, the zoning regulations applicable within each district shall apply equally to each portion of the lot situated in a separate district.

b.    Where boundaries approximate blocks and lots, street and alley lines or other identifiable property or boundary lines, such lines shall be construed to be the district boundary. Where such boundaries are shown as being within street and alley lines or within identifiable rights-of-way or waterways, the centerline thereof shall be construed to be the district boundary.

SECTION 306 CONDITIONAL USES

306.1 General.      The principal objective of this zoning code is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses, and for the property location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the community. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various use districts established by this code. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses which it may be necessary to allow because of the unusual characteristics of the service they provide the public. These conditional uses require particular considerations as to their proper location to adjacent, established or in- tended uses, or to the planned growth of the community. The conditions controlling the locations and operation of such special uses are established by the applicable sections of this code.

No such planned unit development permit shall be granted unless such development will meet the use limitations of the zoning district in which it is located and meet the density and other limitations of such districts, except as such requirements may be lawfully modified as provided by this code. Compliance with the regulations of this code in no way excuses the de- veloper from the applicable requirements of a subdivision ordinance, except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in the approval of the application for the planned unit development.

1301.2 Intent. These regulations are to encourage and provide means for effecting desirable and quality development by permitting greater flexibility and design freedom than that permitted under the basic district regulations, and to accomplish a well-balanced, aesthetically satisfying city and economically desirable development of building sites within a PUD. These regulations are established to permit latitude in the development of the building site if such development is found to be in accordance with the purpose, spirit and intent of this ordinance and is found not to be hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment, property values or the character of the neighborhood or the health, safety and welfare of the community. It is intended to permit and encourage diversification, variation and imagination in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and heights of structures for developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and co- hesive unified projects. It is further intended to encourage more rational and economic development with relationship to public services, and to encourage and facilitate the preservation of open lands.

SECTION 1302           CONDITIONS

1302.1 Area. No planned unit development shall have an area less than that approved by the planning commission as adequate for the proposed development.

1302.2 Uses. A planned unit development which will contain uses not permitted in the zoning district in which it is to be located will require a change of zoning district and shall be accompanied by an application for a zoning amendment, except that any residential use shall be considered a permitted use in a planned unit development, which allows residential uses and shall be governed by density, design and other requirements of the planned unit development permit. Where a site is situated in more than one use district, the permitted uses applicable to such property in one district may be extended into the adjacent use district.

1302.3 Ownership. The development shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by all owners of the property.

1302.4 Design. The planning commission shall require such arrangements of structures and open spaces within the site development plan as necessary to ensure that adjacent properties will not be adversely affected.

1302.4.1 Density. Density of land use shall in no case be more than 15 percent higher than allowed in the zoning district.

1302.4.2 Arrangement. Where feasible, the least height and density of buildings and uses shall be arranged around the boundaries of the development.

1302.4.3 Specific regulations. Lot area, width, yard, height, density and coverage regulations shall be determined by approval of the site development plan.

1302.5 Open spaces. Preservation, maintenance and ownership of required open spaces within the development shall be accomplished by either:

1.    Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system; or

2.    Creating a permanent, open space easement on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remain perpetually in recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of an owners’ association established with articles of association and bylaws, which are satisfactory to the legislative body.

1302.6 Landscaping. Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the uses within the site and as a means of integrating the proposed development into its surroundings shall be planned and presented to the planning commission for approval, together with other required plans for the development. A planting plan showing proposed tree and shrubbery plantings shall be prepared for the entire site to be developed. A grading and drainage plan shall also be submitted to the planning commission with the application.

1302.7 Signs. The size, location, design and nature of signs, if any, and the intensity and direction of area or floodlighting shall be detailed in the application.

1302.8 Desirability. The proposed use of the particular location shall be shown as necessary or desirable, to provide a service or facility that will contribute to the general well-being of the surrounding area. It shall also be shown that under the circumstances of the particular case, the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the planned unit development.

SECTION 1303           PLANNING COMMISSION DETERMINATION

1303.1 Considerations. In carrying out the intent of this section, the planning commission shall consider the following principles:

1.    It is the intent of this section that site and building plans for a PUD shall be prepared by a designer or team of designers having professional competence in urban planning as proposed in the application. The commission shall be permitted to require the applicant to engage such professional expertise as a qualified designer or design team.

2.    It is not the intent of this section that control of the design of a PUD by the planning commission be so rigidly exercised that individual initiative be stifled and substantial additional expense incurred; rather, it is the intent of this section that the control exercised be the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of this section.

3.    The planning commission shall be authorized to approve or disapprove an application for a PUD.

In an approval, the commission shall be permitted to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to secure compliance with the purposes set forth in this chapter. The denial of an application for a PUD by the planning commission shall be permitted to be appealed to the legislative body of the jurisdiction.

SECTION 1304           REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS

1304.1 General. The legislative body, as part of the approval of a PUD, shall be permitted to require an applicant to make reasonable contributions to include, but not limited to any combination of the following:

1.    That the proponents intend to start construction within 1 year of either the approval of the project or of any necessary zoning district change, and intend to complete said construction, or approved stages thereof, within 4 years from the date construction begins.

2.    That the development is planned as one complex land use rather than as an aggregation of individual and unrelated buildings and uses.
