Sec. 1-4.02 Administrative Citations—Procedures.
The following provisions govern the procedures relating to administrative citations:

(a) Declaration and Purpose. The Council finds and determines that there is a need for an alternative method of enforcement for minor violations of the Municipal Code. The Council further finds and declares that an appropriate method of enforcement for these types of violations is an administrative citation program. The procedures established in this Section shall be in addition to criminal, civil or any other legal remedy established by law which may be pursued to address violations of this Municipal Code.

(b) Every violation of a provision of this Code, the penalty for which is defined as an “infraction” or “misdemeanor,” shall be subject to an administrative fine. The provisions of this Section are in addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which may be pursued by the City and nothing shall prevent the City from initiating civil, criminal or other legal or equitable proceedings as an alternative to the proceedings set forth in this Section, or abating a nuisance and recovering the costs of abatement.

(c) The administrative citation shall state the fine imposed by the City as a result of the violation. If the violation pertains to building, plumbing, electrical, or other similar structural or zoning issues that do not create an immediate danger to health or safety, the citation shall provide for a reasonable period of time to correct the violation prior to the imposition of an administrative fine. Said reasonable period of time shall be at least five (5) days, but not more than forty-five (45) days, unless the Enforcement Officer finds that a greater length of time for compliance is necessary. The Enforcement Officer may also provide for the same reasonable period of time to correct other types of violations.

(d) Contents of an Administrative Citation. Each administrative citation issued to a person shall contain the following:

(1) The date of the violation.

(2) The address or a legal description of the location where the violation occurred.

(3) The section of the Code violated and a description of the violation.

(4) A description of the action required to correct the violation, if applicable.

(5) The number of days allowed to correct the violation prior to the imposition of the fine, if applicable.

(6) The amount of the fine assessed for the violation.

(7) A description of the fine payment process, including a description of the due date and the place where the fine shall be paid.

(8) An order prohibiting the continuation or repeated occurrence of the violation described in the administrative citation.

(9) A description of the administrative citation review process, including the time within which the administrative citation may be contested and where a request for hearing may be obtained.

(10) The name and signature of the Enforcement Officer.

(e) Service of the Administrative Citation. Service shall be made by:

(1) Personal service by any of the methods for service of a summons in a civil action pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 415.10; or

(2) First class mail to the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll. Service shall be complete at the time the citation is deposited into the United States mail; or

(3) If personal service or service by first class mail is not possible, service shall be provided by publishing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation and posting an eight-and-one-half (8-1/2) inch by eleven (11) inch enlargement of the administrative citation in a conspicuous location on the property.

(f) Amount of Fines. The amount of fines imposed pursuant to this Section shall not exceed the maximum amount of the fine established for an infraction in Section 1-4.01(b).

(g) Time to Pay. All fines shall be paid to the City within thirty (30) calendar days from the effective date of the administrative citation. The effective date of an administrative citation shall be the date the citation is issued, unless the Enforcement Officer granted an opportunity for the person cited to correct the violation. Where a correction period has been granted, the effective date of the administrative citation shall be on the final date of the correction period, if the person has not corrected the violation. An administrative citation fine shall be refunded if it is determined after hearing that the person charged was not the person responsible for the violation, or there was no violation as charged in the administrative citation.

(h) Methods of Collection. The City may use all available legal means to collect any past due fines imposed by administrative citations including, but not limited to, contracting with collection agencies, filing liens and seeking judgments in court.

(i) Request for Hearing.

(1) Any person issued an administrative citation may contest the issuance of the citation by filing a written request for hearing no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the effective date of the citation. The written request shall include a detailed written explanation of the reasons for contesting the administrative citation.

(2) The person to whom an administrative citation is issued shall deposit the amount of the fine with the City Clerk at the time of the request for hearing, or request an advance deposit hardship waiver pursuant to subsection (j) of this section.

(3) The person requesting the hearing shall be notified of the time and place set for the hearing at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. The hearing shall be set for a date that is not less than fifteen (15) calendar days from the date that a completed request for administrative hearing is filed in accordance with the above provisions.

(j) Advance Deposit Hardship Waivers.

(1) Any person who requests an administrative hearing and is financially unable to make the advance deposit of the fine, may file a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver by completing a form approved by the City Manager and submitting the form to the City Clerk within three (3) days after filing the request for a hearing.

(2) The City Manager, or the City Manager’s designee, may waive the requirement of an advance deposit only if the applicant submits the required advance deposit hardship waiver form and includes supporting documents demonstrating to the satisfaction of the City Manager that it would be a significant financial burden on the recipient of the administrative citation to deposit the fine prior to the hearing. The City Clerk shall serve written notice of the City Manager’s determination on the recipient of the administrative citation by first class mail, return receipt requested. Service shall be deemed complete at the time the notice is deposited into the mail and addressed to the person at the address indicated on the hearing request form. Personal service may also be used.

(3) If an advance deposit hardship waiver is not granted, the recipient of the administrative citation shall deposit the fine with the City Clerk within five (5) days of service of the decision, or at least twenty-four (24) hours before the hearing, whichever is sooner.

(k) Appointment of Hearing Officer. The City Manager shall designate a fair and impartial Hearing Officer for the administrative citation hearings.

(l) Hearing Procedure.

(1) All hearings shall be held before the Hearing Officer.

(2) Failure of the party contesting the administrative citation to appear at the hearing shall constitute forfeiture of the fine and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

(3) The administrative citation and any additional report submitted by the Enforcement Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation. The Enforcement Officer may present additional evidence at the hearing.

(4) At the hearing, the person contesting the administrative citation shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence concerning the administrative citation. Both parties may question the witnesses.

(5) The Hearing Officer may continue the hearing from time to time and provide the person contesting the administrative citation with additional time to remedy the violation. In addition, the Hearing Officer may request additional information or evidence from the Enforcement Officer or the recipient of the administrative citation prior to issuing a written decision.

(6) All hearings shall be recorded by a video or audio device, unless the City decides to utilize a court reporter. If a court reporter is not utilized, the City is not required to provide a transcription of the hearing, but shall make the video or audio recording available to the person cited within thirty (30) days after the hearing. The City may charge a reasonable fee for reproducing the recording. If a court reporter is utilized, the recipient of the administrative citation may obtain a copy of the transcript upon payment of any applicable reasonable fees or costs. The City may destroy such recordings or transcripts after all appeals of the administrative citation are exhausted and in accordance with the City’s Records Retention Policy.

(7) The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with technical rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule that might consider such admission improper in a civil action. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation. Irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

(8) After considering all of the testimonies and evidence submitted at the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision to affirm or cancel the administrative citation. The written decision shall include the Hearing Officer’s findings and information regarding the recipient’s appeal rights to the Superior Court. The recipient of the administrative citation shall be served with a copy of the Hearing Officer’s written decision by first class mail, or by personal service. The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be the City’s final administrative decision.

(9) If the Hearing Officer determines that the administrative citation should be affirmed, the fine on deposit with the City shall be retained. In addition, the Hearing Officer shall assess the cost of holding the hearing to the violator, and order the violator to pay the hearing costs to the City within thirty (30) days.

(10) If the Hearing Officer determines that the administrative citation should be upheld, and the fine has not been deposited pursuant to an advance deposit hardship waiver, the Hearing Officer shall set forth in the decision a payment schedule for the fine and the cost of the hearing.

(11) If the Hearing Officer determines that the evidence presented does not support the issuance of the administrative citation, the fine shall be deemed null and void and the City shall, within thirty (30) calendar days, refund the amount of the fine. In addition, the City shall not assess hearing costs.

(m) Right to Judicial Review. A person aggrieved by the administrative decision of a Hearing Officer may file an appeal with the Contra Costa County Superior Court within twenty (20) days of the service of the Hearing Officer’s decision, in accordance with the provisions in California Government Code Section 53069.4. (Ord. 499 § 1 (part), 2016)

Sec. 1-4.03 Arrest Authority of Officers and Employees.
The City Manager, the Finance Director, the City Clerk, the Planning Director, the Public Works Director, the City Engineer, the Parks and Recreation Director, the Building Official, and their designees, shall have the authority as public officers or employees to arrest without warrant another person when such officers or employees have reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has, in their presence, violated any provision of this Code, violation of which is a public offense.

Article 4. Prevention of Nepotism and Cronyism in Employment and Contracting

Sec. 2-3.401 Purpose.
In adopting this Article, it is the intent of the City Council to prohibit the contracting with, and employment of, relatives and friends of City officials, to ensure that no conflict of interest, favoritism, preferential treatment, or discrimination enters into the hiring, promotion, contracting and/or transfer practices of the City.

The regulations established by this Article shall apply to all City officials, as defined herein, and to all individuals or firms who provide services to the City as independent contractors or paid consultants. (Ord. 486 § 1 (part), 2015)

Sec. 2-3.402 Definitions.
“City” as used herein shall mean the City of Hercules, California.

“City officials,” for the purposes of this Article, means City elected officials, City appointed officials, appointees to City ad hoc or standing committees, appointees to City commissions, and City employees, including all individuals who are employed by the City Manager, City Attorney, and City Clerk, as well as all employees of City agencies and departments.

“Consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship” means any consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship between a City official or contractor and any City official who may supervise him or her directly or indirectly, or who may influence the terms and conditions of his or her employment or contract with the City.

“Contractor” means any individual or firm providing material, equipment, or services to the City pursuant to a written or oral agreement with the City as an independent contractor or consultant, and not as an employee.

“Cronyism” means making an employment or contracting decision based upon personal, political, financial, or commercial relationships instead of merit when the person or entity benefiting from the employment, promotion, supervision or contract does not have the qualifications for the position or contract, or is being compensated at a rate that is more than the rate that would be paid other employees or contractors performing the same or similar functions.

“Family relationship” means a relationship by blood, adoption, marriage, domestic partnership, foster care, and cohabitation, and includes parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, children, foster children, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, first cousins, second cousins, siblings, and the spouses or domestic partners of each of these relatives and cohabitants. This definition includes any relationship that exists by virtue of marriage or domestic partnership, such as in-law and step relationships, which are covered to the same extent as blood relationships.

“Nepotism” means employing, promoting, supervising or contracting with a person or persons who have a family relationship or a consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship with a City official. (Ord. 486 § 1 (part), 2015)

Sec. 2-3.403 Restricting Nepotism and Cronyism in Public Employment.
(a) Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the City of Hercules to hire, promote, and transfer employees on the basis of individual merit and to avoid favoritism or discrimination in making such decisions. The employment of relatives of City officials, in positions where one (1) might have influence over the other’s status or job security, is regarded as a violation of this Section. Nepotism and cronyism, as defined in Section 2-3.402, are prohibited from City employment decisions to the full extent permitted by law.

It is therefore the City’s policy to prohibit nepotism and cronyism in public employment according to the guidelines below:

(1) An individual will not be hired, promoted, transferred, or otherwise placed into a position when a person with whom the individual has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship occupies a position in his or her direct supervisory chain of command.

(2) Individuals will not be hired, promoted, transferred, or otherwise placed into a position when to do so would constitute cronyism.

(3) Department heads are prohibited from employing or supervising any person with whom the department head has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship within his/her department in any capacity in which that person may receive compensation.

(4) Department heads are prohibited from employing or supervising any individual, when to do so would constitute cronyism.

(5) City positions should be advertised to the public and filled pursuant to an objective selection process based upon qualification.

(b) Resolving a Violation. In the event nepotism or cronyism arises due to circumstances such as through promotion, transfer, the development of a consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship or marriage, the involved individuals have six (6) months in which to settle the issue voluntarily (i.e., by having one (1) of them change assignment or leave City employment).

If the affected parties are unable to resolve the situation within the time provided, their immediate supervisors will review the case at the end of the six (6) month period. The supervisor’s decision concerning which employee must change assignment, made after consultation with the Director of Human Resources, will be binding.

(c) Responsibility to Report. It is the responsibility of a City official to report a violation of this Section. A City employee must notify his/her supervisor, and it is the responsibility of an elected or appointed official to notify the City Manager, or the City Attorney in the case of a violation by the City Manager, when any of the following situations occur:

(1) When a person who is hired or appointed, or is being considered to be hired or appointed, has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship with a City official; and/or

(2) When a City official has or develops a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship with another City official who occupies a position in his or her direct supervisory chain of command; and/or

(3) When hiring, promotion, appointment or supervision of a City official constitutes cronyism as defined in Section 2-3.402.

The intent of this Section is to ensure that no conflict of interest, favoritism, preferential treatment, or discrimination enters into the hiring, promotion, and/or transfer practices of the City.

(d) Penalty for Failure to Report. A City official, other than an elected official, who knows or should know that a person with whom he or she has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship is employed by the City, or who knows or should know of any employment decision that constitutes nepotism or cronyism and fails to report the violation, is subject to discipline, including but not limited to suspension or termination.

An elected official who knows or should know that a person with whom he or she has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship is employed by the City, or who knows or should know of an employment decision that constitutes nepotism or cronyism and fails to report the violation, is subject to censure. (Ord. 486 § 1 (part), 2015)

Sec. 2-3.404 Restricting Nepotism and Cronyism in Public Contracting.
(a) Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the City of Hercules to avoid favoritism or discrimination in making decisions to award contracts for supplies, construction, maintenance, professional or other services. The awarding of a contract or the approval of payments or expenses under a contract by a City official, to a person with whom she or he has a family relationship or a consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship, is regarded as a violation of this Section. Nepotism and cronyism as defined in Section 2-3.402 are hereby prohibited from City contracting decisions to the full extent permitted by law.

It is therefore the City’s policy to prohibit nepotism and cronyism in City contracts, according to the guidelines below:

(1) An individual contractor shall not be awarded a contract with the City when the contractor has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship with a City official who may have some influence over the award or management of the contract, or when the award of a contract to that individual contractor would constitute nepotism or cronyism.

(2) Firms shall not be awarded contracts with the City when an owner, manager, senior member, principal, officer, or partner of the firm has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship with a City official who may have some influence over the award or management of the contract, or when the award of a contract to a firm would constitute nepotism or cronyism.

(3) A City official is prohibited from awarding contracts to any individual with whom he or she has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship, or to any firm when an owner, manager, senior member, principal, officer, or partner of the firm has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship with the employee or official, or when to do so would constitute nepotism or cronyism.

The intent of this Section is to ensure that no conflict of interest, favoritism, or discrimination enters into the contracting practices of the City.

(b) Responsibility to Report a Violation of Regulations Against Contracting with Relatives or Contracts that Constitute Cronyism. It is the responsibility of a City official to report a violation of this Section. A City employee must notify his or her supervisor, and an elected or appointed official must notify the City Manager, or the City Attorney in the case of a violation by the City Manager, when he or she is aware of any of the following situations:

(1) When a person who has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship with a City official is being considered for the award of a contract to provide services to the City; and/or

(2) When a City official has or develops a family relationship or a romantic and/or consensual sexual relationship with a person who has an existing contract to provide services to the City; and/or

(3) When the award of a contract would constitute nepotism or cronyism as defined in Section 2-3.402.

(c) Penalty for Failure to Report. A City official, other than an elected city official, who knows or should know that a person with whom he or she has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship is being considered for or has been awarded a contract with the City in violation of this Section, and fails to report the violation, is subject to discipline, including, but not limited to, suspension or termination.

An elected official who knows or should know that a person with whom he or she has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship is being considered for or has been awarded a contract with the City in violation of this Section, and fails to report the violation, is subject to censure.

A contractor who has a contract with the City or who seeks a contract with the City and fails to report that a person with whom she or he has a family relationship or consensual romantic and/or sexual relationship is employed by the City or is a City official, or that the award of the contract constitutes cronyism in violation of this Section, may have his or her contract terminated and may be precluded from being awarded any future contracts with the City. (Ord. 486 § 1 (part), 2015)

Sec. 2-3.405 Penalties Not Exclusive.
The penalties provided under this Article are not exclusive, and do not preclude punishment under any other applicable provision of law. (Ord. 486 § 1 (part), 2015)

Chapter 4. Minors
Article 1: Daytime Curfew

Sec. 4-4.101 Purpose and Intent—Daytime Curfew.
(a) State law requires all persons between the ages of six (6) and eighteen (18) to attend school. Regular school attendance provides important benefits not only to the students themselves but also to the health, safety, and welfare of all residents within the City. Regular school attendance promotes employability upon graduation and reduces delinquency as well as the potential for future dependence upon public assistance.

(b) The community as a whole suffers when a minor student is not attending school. Truancy or unexcused absenteeism from school results in a loss of educational opportunities to the student and a loss of revenue to the school. Truancy also often leads to vandalism, petty theft, daytime burglaries, and other criminal activity. Truants often tend to loiter in and about public places; frequently, persons going about their lawful business as well as public property become targets of the delinquent behaviors of truants when they should be in school.

(c) It is the intent of the City Council of the City of Hercules, by this Chapter and in cooperation and coordination with the West Contra Costa County Unified School District and the John Swett Unified School District, by the exercise of the City’s traditional police powers and its curfew powers over minors, to establish and enforce a curfew upon minors of school age on school days during the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., with stated exceptions, in order to provide protection for the community and public property from deleterious effects of truancy. This is not intended to abridge or interfere with the lawful rights of parents or other legal guardians or to contravene or supersede the laws of the State of California dealing with such matters.

(1) Reducing the likelihood that youth will become victims of criminal activity;

(2) Reducing the likelihood that youth will become suspects of criminal activity;

(c) No person employed by or having control of any cafe, tavern, restaurant, bar, drive-in, public dance, or place of public amusement shall serve or permit the use of the facilities thereof to any minor not accompanied by a parent, guardian, or other adult person having the legal care and custody of the minor between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. (Ord. 439 § 1 (part), 2008)

(h) When the youth is exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States or California Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, or speech;

(i) When the youth is married, an active member of the United States military, or has been emancipated in accordance with the California Family Code Section 7000;

(j) When the youth is waiting at an officially designated bus stop or other transit provider stop, during the hours that those modes of transportation function. (Ord. 439 § 1 (part), 2008)

Chapter 5. Use or Operation of Motorcycles, Motor-Driven Cycles, Motorized Bicycles and Off-Highway Motor Vehicles
Sec. 4-5.01 Findings and Purpose.
(a) The City Council finds that the operation of motor vehicles as defined in Section 415 of the Vehicle Code of the State of California on unimproved property within the limits of the City of Hercules is and can be the cause of irritating dust, noxious exhaust fumes, noise, erosion of land, increased risk of fire, creation of unimproved roadways and pathways which constitute a danger to persons in such areas, an adverse effect on the environment in such areas and on the persons residing therein, the destruction of plants, landscaping and other personal and real property, which conduct adversely affects the health, safety, welfare, comfort and privacy of occupants and residents of the City of Hercules and constitutes a public nuisance. Because said conduct may be intermittent, fleeting, moving or caused by persons who are minors, the other provisions of this Code, as well as other legal remedies, are inadequate to control said conduct and its adverse effects. The provisions of this Chapter relating to the regulations of motor vehicles are therefore necessary for the public health, safety and welfare.

(c) By imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months, or by a fine not less than five hundred dollars ($500) and not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both, for a second offense or subsequent offense. (Ord. 377 § 1 (part), 2002)

Service of the notice shall be made by: (1) personal service by any of the methods for service of a summons in a civil action pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 415.10; or (2) first class mail addressed to the owner at the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll with service deemed complete at the time the citation is deposited into the United States mail; or (3) if personal service or service by first class mail is not possible, service shall be provided by publishing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation and posting an eight and one-half (8-1/2) inch by eleven (11) inch enlargement of the notice in a conspicuous location on the property.

(c) The notice shall also specify the necessary actions required to reasonably abate the nuisance.

A hearing fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) must be submitted with the hearing request.

(e) If such nuisance is not completely abated by the owner as directed within the designated abatement period and the owner does not request a hearing pursuant to Section 4-10.08, then the City Manager, or such other City official as may be designated, may, after consultation with the City Attorney, cause the same to be abated by the City either through the use of its own employees or private contract. The owner shall be responsible to the City for the cost of abating the nuisance. (Ord. 499 § 2 (part), 2016: Ord. 359 § 4 (part), 2000. Formerly 4-10.23)

Sec. 4-10.07 Enforcement Officer—Defined.
For purposes of this Chapter, “Enforcement Officer” shall mean any City employee or agent of the City with the authority to enforce any provision of this Code as determined by the City Manager. (Ord. 499 § 2 (part), 2016: Ord. 359 § 4 (part), 2000. Formerly 4-10.21)

Sec. 4-10.08 Request for Hearing and Notice of Administrative Hearing.
(a) Whenever the Enforcement Officer finds that a public nuisance exists, the City shall include in the abatement order that the owner has the right to a hearing before a Hearing Officer. If the owner desires a hearing he or she shall so advise the City within the time specified in the notice from the City. The notice shall advise the owner that if legal action is instituted by either the owner or City in any manner relating to the abatement of the nuisance, the City shall seek recovery of its costs and attorneys’ fees if it is determined to be the prevailing party.

(b) Procedure for Requesting a Hearing.

(1) Any person issued an abatement order pursuant to this Section may contest the Enforcement Officer’s determination by filing a written request for hearing no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the effective date of the notice. The written request shall include a detailed written explanation of the reasons for contesting the determination.

(2) The person requesting the hearing shall be notified of the time and place set for the hearing at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. The hearing shall be set for a date that is not less than fifteen (15) calendar days from the date that a completed request for administrative hearing is filed in accordance with the above provisions.

(c) Whenever the Enforcement Officer finds that a nuisance has recurred following abatement of that nuisance by the owner, the Enforcement Officer may set the matter for public hearing before the Hearing Officer. The City shall give the owner notice of the hearing as required where the hearing is requested by the owner. Where the hearing was set by the Enforcement Officer, costs of abatement assessed shall include the two hundred dollar ($200.00) hearing fee. (Ord. 499 § 2 (part), 2016)

Sec. 4-10.10 Hearing by Hearing Officer.
At the time fixed in the notice, a Hearing Officer appointed under Section 4-10.09 shall proceed to hear evidence relating to the nuisance. The Hearing Officer may continue the hearing from time to time. Based upon the administrative record, the evidence as may be presented pursuant to this subsection, and the written or oral arguments of interested persons, the Hearing Officer shall determine whether the property, in its then-current condition, constitutes a public nuisance. If the owner fails to appear at the time fixed for the hearing, or at any time to which the hearing may be continued, such failure to appear shall not deprive the Hearing Officer of his jurisdiction to determine the matter, but shall constitute a failure of the owner to exhaust its administrative remedies.

The abatement order and any additional report submitted by the Enforcement Officer shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation. The Enforcement Officer may present additional evidence at the hearing.

At the hearing, the person contesting the validity of a notice to abate shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence. Both parties may question the witnesses.

The Hearing Officer may provide the person with additional time to remedy the violation. In addition, the Hearing Officer may request additional information or evidence from the Enforcement Officer or the recipient of the notice to abate prior to issuing a written decision.

All hearings shall be recorded by a video or audio device, unless the City decides to utilize a court reporter. If a court reporter is not utilized, the City is not required to provide a transcription of the hearing, but shall make the video or audio recording available within thirty (30) days after the hearing. The City may charge a reasonable fee for reproducing the recording. If a court reporter is utilized, the recipient of the notice to abate may obtain a copy of the transcript upon payment of any applicable reasonable fees or costs. The City may destroy such recordings or transcripts after all appeals are exhausted.

The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with technical rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule that might consider such admission improper in a civil action. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation. Irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall render a written decision regarding the nuisance and whether or not the City is authorized to cause the nuisance to be abated and assess its costs thereof to the owner as a special assessment against the property. The Hearing Officer may include the manner and scope of abatement in the decision.

If the Hearing Officer determines that the nuisance condition is one which is susceptible of recurring after abatement if further precautions are not taken, he or she may also direct that the owner take adequate precautions for a period of up to one (1) year so that the nuisance is not permitted to recur for such time.

If the Hearing Officer determines that the evidence presented does not support the issuance of the abatement order, the abatement order shall be deemed null and void and the City shall not assess hearing costs. (Ord. 499 § 2 (part), 2016: Ord. 359 § 4 (part), 2000. Formerly 4-10.25)

Sec. 4-10.11 Appeal of Hearing Officer’s Decision.

Sec. 4-10.12 Special Assessment and Lien on Property for Costs of Abatement by the City.
(a) The costs of abatement by the City shall be levied as a special assessment against the subject property and certified to the Auditor of the County of Contra Costa. Such special assessments shall be recorded as a lien on the property and shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment taxes.

(b) After recordation, such lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law.

(c) Such notice of lien for recordation shall be substantially as set out in Form 4-10.12. (Ord. 499 § 2 (part), 2016: Ord. 252 Div. 1 (part), 1987. Formerly 4-10.16)

The City Council of the City of Hercules does hereby find as follows: The Hercules Police Department has been required to respond to an increasing and excessive number of false alarms in the City. The problem of false alarms includes the diversion of police personnel from other necessary activities, the potential delay in police response to valid calls for service, the hazards to the general public and officers when responding to false alarms, and the waste of City resources in response to false alarms. This is an expense that should properly be borne by the persons responsible for the false alarms. (Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 2006)

Sec. 4-12.02 Definitions.
As used in this Chapter:

(a) “False alarm” means any burglar, fire, theft, or emergency alarm which, through equipment malfunction or human error, activates and causes a police response in circumstances where no criminal activity or emergency exists or has occurred. The term “false alarm” includes alarms located in residential and nonresidential real property, motor vehicles, and boats.

(b) “Costs incurred for police services” means the actual cost of police personnel equipment used in an alarm response, including:

(1) The prevailing salaries, benefits, and overhead costs attributable to police officers at the time of the alarm for the amount of time spent in responding to and remaining at the site of the false alarm;

(2) The cost of any medical treatment to officers injured while responding to or investigating a false alarm;

(3) The prorated expense associated with the use of City equipment; and

(4) The cost of repairing or replacing any City equipment that is damaged or destroyed during the response to or investigation of a false alarm.

(c) “Person responsible for a false alarm” means every person or business entity which owns, rents, leases, or otherwise has control over the real property, vehicle, or boat from which the false alarm originates. If the responsible person is a minor, then the parents or guardians of the minor will be jointly and severally liable for the costs incurred for police services pursuant to this Chapter. (Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 2006)

Sec. 4-12.03 False Alarms.
The person responsible for a false alarm shall be held liable for all costs incurred for police services due to the response or investigation of a false alarm. (Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 2006)

Sec. 4-12.04 Automatic Shut-Off Required.
All audible alarm systems within the City of Hercules shall be equipped with an automatic shut-off device which deactivates the alarm within twenty (20) minutes. Violation of this Section shall be punishable as an infraction pursuant to HMC Section 1-4.01. (Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 2006)

Sec. 4-12.05 Fees for False Alarms.
Whenever any alarm system issues or causes a false alarm, or whenever any person in control of, or employed by the owner or operator of, a premises where such an alarm is installed causes a false alarm, the following fees shall be imposed:

(a) No fee for the first, second, or third (3rd) false alarm occurring in a calendar year;

(b) One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150) for the fourth (4th) false alarm occurring in a calendar year;

(c) Two Hundred Dollars ($200) for the fifth (5th) and each subsequent false alarm occurring in a calendar year;

(d) As used in this Chapter, the term “calendar year” means January through December, inclusive.

These fees are in addition to any additional costs for police services as described in this Chapter, Section 4-12.02(b).

The fees and costs in this Section shall be considered a debt due and owing to the City of Hercules, and may be collected by any means permitted by law.

The only exceptions to the fees for false alarms shall be the failure of the telephone system (when said system is used to transmit an alarm), or failure of the electrical power, public utility system, or acts of nature (occasioned exclusively by violence of nature without the interference of any human agency.) The person claiming failure of the telephone system or other valid excuse shall have the burden of proving or establishing that the malfunction was beyond their control.

No charges for false alarms shall be made for a system under repair, if both the Police Communications Center and any intermediate answering service are notified in advance that the system is under repair. Notification of the commencement of repairs shall be made in person by the individual making the repairs, who shall present proof of their alarm agent registration with the Bureau of Consumer Affairs and such other evidence as may be required showing their authority to undertake repairs. Notice shall also be given upon the completion of repairs, and may be done by telephone to the Communications Center. (Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 2006)

Sec. 4-12.06 No Response Status.
An alarm subscriber may request “no response” status to avoid future fees. The request shall be made in writing to the police department. The person submitting the request must prove that they have the authority to request “no response” status. “No response” status shall not go into effect until the request, with all supporting documentation, has been approved by the Chief of Police.

Any person charged a false alarm fee under the provisions of this Chapter or who has been denied “no response” status may appeal that fee or determination to a hearing officer appointed by the Chief of Police. The hearing procedures shall be informal, and the rules of evidence or procedure for administrative hearings shall not apply. The decision of the hearing officer is final. (Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 2006)

Chapter 13. Alcohol Offenses and Imposition of Fee for Police Services
Sec. 4-13.01 Purpose and Findings.
The City Council of the City of Hercules does hereby find as follows: Inadequately supervised parties where alcohol is consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one (21) constitute a potential hazard for the partygoers and those who might come into contact with them. Further, the control of parties, gatherings, or events on private property is necessary when such activity is determined to be a threat to the peace, health, safety or general welfare of the public. Such parties often require multiple responses from police officers. Dispersing such parties and controlling participants causes a shift of police manpower and resources from other necessary police activities. The City ought to be able to recover the cost of subsequent responses from the responsible parties. (Ord. 320 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 4-13.02 Definitions.

(b) “Person responsible for the event” means every person who owns, rents, leases, or otherwise has control of the premises where the party, gathering, or event takes place; the person(s) in charge of the premises; and the person(s) who organized the event. If the person responsible for the event is a minor, then the parent or guardian of that minor will be jointly and severally liable for the costs incurred for police services pursuant to this Chapter. If the party, gathering or event occurs on public property owned by the City of Hercules, the persons responsible for the event shall not include City employees or appointed or elected City officials who are acting within the course and scope of their official public duties.

(c) “Police services” means the cost of police personnel and equipment used in a subsequent response, including the following: (1) the salaries, benefits and overhead attributable to the police officers to be charged at the hourly rates adopted from time to time by the City for the amount of time actually spent in responding to, or in remaining at, the party, gathering or event; (2) the actual cost of any medical treatment to injured officers; and (3) the prorated expense associated with the use of City equipment; and the cost of repairing any damaged City equipment or property.

(d) “Subsequent response” means any second or follow-up contact made by one or more police officers to the participants in a party, gathering or event, whether in person or by loudspeaker.

(e) “Threat to the public peace, health, safety or welfare” includes failure to immediately comply with a lawful order by a police officer, or failure to do one or more of the following after a lawful order by a police officer:

(1) Stop a fight between two (2) or more persons attending a party, gathering or event;

(2) Stop the disturbance of another by the making of loud or unreasonable noise by a person attending the party, gathering or event;

(3) Stop a person attending the party, gathering or event from using offensive words in a manner which is likely to provoke an immediate violent reaction;

(4) Stop a person attending the party, gathering or event from rioting or using force or violence;

(5) Stop a person attending the party, gathering or event from committing one or more specified unlawful acts;

(6) Stop the party, gathering or event or disperse the crowd. (Ord. 320 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 4-13.03 Unlawful Gatherings on Public or Private Property.
No person shall permit, allow, or host a party, gathering, or event at his or her place of residence or other public or private location under his or her control where five (5) or more persons under the age of twenty-one (21) are present and alcoholic beverages are in the possession of, or being consumed by, any person under the age of twenty-one (21) years. A violation of this Section shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable as set forth in Section 1-4.01 of this Code. (Ord. 320 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 4-13.04 Police Services at Parties, Gatherings or Events Requiring a Subsequent Response.
When a party, gathering or event occurs on public or private property and a police officer at the scene determines that there is a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, the person responsible for the event will be held liable for the cost of providing police services during a subsequent response by the police, after a first warning to a person responsible for the event to control the threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare. The subsequent response may also result in the arrest and/or citation of violators under the California Penal Code, or other provisions of this Code. (Ord. 320 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 4-13.05 Police Services Fee.
The police services fee shall include the actual cost of police services, as set forth in Section 4-13.02(c). The anticipated range of police services costs for a single party, gathering or event is from Seventy-Five Dollars ($75) to One Thousand Dollars ($1000). Nothing in this Chapter shall be interpreted as waiving the City’s right to seek reimbursement for actual costs, including those exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($1000) through all available legal remedies. The amount of the police services fee shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person responsible for the event and, if minors, their parents or guardians. Any person owing such fees shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the City for recovery of such fees, as well as court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. (Ord. 320 § 1 (part), 1993)

The Chief of Police shall conduct an appropriate investigation to determine for the protection of the public safety whether the permit may be issued.

Chapter 15. Removal of Mature Trees
Sec. 4-15.01 Purpose.
The presence of mature trees within the City of Hercules constitutes an important community amenity. These trees are found on both public and private property. This has raised a concern that mature trees could be removed from land slated for development, precluding the City from planning for the preservation of trees and identifying feasible mitigation measures during the land use approval process. At present, the City has no regulations restricting the removal of trees. The uncontrolled removal or destruction of mature trees on undeveloped or partially developed properties threatens to adversely affect the character and scenic beauty of the City and increase the risk of erosion and flooding. Removal of large numbers of mature trees could create an environmental impact which would not be subject to City review under current ordinances. In order to preserve the public health, safety and general welfare, it is necessary to establish a prohibition on the removal of any living mature trees in the City. The City Council specifically declares its intention not to restrict the removal of trees by residential property owners. (Ord. 331 § 1 (part), 1996)

Sec. 4-15.02 Definitions.
(a) “Mature tree” includes any living tree with a trunk diameter measuring twelve (12) inches or greater when measured at “breast height,” which is roughly four and one-half (4-1/2) feet above the surface of the ground.

(b) “Tree removal” shall include any one or more of the following:

(1) Complete removal of a mature tree.

(2) Any action foreseeably leading to the death of a mature tree or permanent damage to its health.

(3) Removal of more than one-third (1/3) of the foliage of a mature tree, except where such removal of foliage is necessary for periodic maintenance appropriate to the particular tree species in question.

(c) “Undeveloped or partially developed property” includes all properties which are available for future development or redevelopment, but does not include developed residential or non-residential properties. (Ord. 331 § 1 (part), 1996)

Sec. 4-15.03 Tree Removal Prohibited.
Except as provided in Section 4-15.04 or 4-15.05, no mature tree shall be removed from any undeveloped or partially developed property, whether public or private, within the City of Hercules for any reason. (Ord. 331 § 1 (part), 1996)

Sec. 4-15.04 Exceptions.
(a) If a mature tree poses an immediate and substantial threat to the safety of persons or property, the property owner may contact the Public Works Director and request approval to remove the tree. After consultation with the City Manager if at all possible, the Public Works Director shall confirm that an emergency situation exists. The Public Works Director may then authorize removal. The Public Works Director may consult with a certified arborist if deemed necessary to confirm the necessity for tree removal. The removal of a mature tree under emergency conditions with approval by the Public Works Director shall be reported to the City Council at the next regularly scheduled City Council meeting.

(b) The prohibition in Section 4-15.03 shall not apply to trees located on the grounds of any public school within the City. (Ord. 331 § 1 (part), 1996)

Sec. 4-15.05 Tree Removal in Conjunction with Development.
Mature trees may be removed in conjunction with development projects for which the City has issued all necessary land use approvals, provided however, that the City approves and the developer implements a tree replacement plan. In addition, mature trees may be removed in conjunction with development projects for which the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and/or the California Department of Fish and Game has issued a permit, provided that the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) The property owner has obtained and is in compliance with a Grading Permit and Erosion and Sediment Control Plan pursuant to Chapter 7-2 of this Code;

(b) The City has approved and the property owner is implementing a tree replacement plan as part of an environmental mitigation program approved by the applicable state or federal agency; and

(c) The proposed pre-development activities are consistent with the City’s General Plan, as determined by the Community and Business Development Director. (Ord. 331 § 1 (part), 1996)

Sec. 4-15.06 Penalties.
Violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter or the knowing or intentional misrepresentation to any officer or employee of the City of any material fact when requesting tree removal under Sections 4-15.04 or 4-15.05 shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. (Ord. 331 § 1 (part), 1996)

Chapter 16. Adult Entertainment Businesses
Sec. 4-16.01 Findings.
The City Council recognizes that there is a need for controls relating to adult oriented entertainment businesses to meet conditions relating to litter, traffic, parking, hours of operation, noise, congestion, public nuisance, and other matters relating to the public health, safety and welfare. The city council also recognizes that because of their nature, adult entertainment businesses are recognized as having objectionable operational characteristics and appearance, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Regulation of the location and appearance of these businesses is necessary to insure that their adverse affects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding neighborhoods.

Sec. 4-16.02 Definitions.

Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) (“CEQA”) and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 15000 et seq.), the City Council finds that it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the adoption of this Chapter will have a significant effect on the environment. Therefore, the adoption of this Chapter is exempt from CEQA pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3). (Ord. 441 (part), 2008)

Sec. 4-17.13 Findings of Urgency.
The City Council adopts this urgency Chapter for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety. The Council finds that California is facing an unprecedented threat to its state economy and local economies because of skyrocketing residential property foreclosure rates in California. Residential property foreclosures increased sevenfold from 2006 to 2007. In 2007, more than eighty-four thousand three hundred seventy-five (84,375) properties were lost to foreclosure in California, and two hundred fifty-four thousand eight hundred twenty-four (254,824) loans went into default, the first step in the foreclosure process. In addition to these findings the City Council incorporates by reference as though fully set forth herein all the findings set forth in Senate Bill 1137.

In the City of Hercules, the Code Enforcement Division investigates foreclosure properties every week. Many properties are maintained voluntarily and in an expeditious manner while others remain in a state of disrepair for weeks at a time. The lack of timely maintenance causes angst among the neighbors, affects property values and impedes the sale of homes in the immediate area. The most common issues with such foreclosure properties are property maintenance, trash, debris, weeds, broken windows and unsecured, vacant houses. These properties violate numerous City ordinances regulating the upkeep of properties, and are considered public nuisances under the City of Hercules Municipal Code. Many owners, including banks and mortgage companies, who foreclose upon such properties have been unwilling to expend the funds and time necessary to remain good neighbors and keep such properties in good condition.

High foreclosure rates have adversely affected property values in California, and will have even greater adverse consequences as foreclosure rates continue to rise. According to statistics released by the HOPE NOW Alliance, the number of completed California foreclosure sales in 2007 increased almost threefold from one thousand nine hundred two (1,902) in the first quarter to five thousand five hundred seventy-four (5,574) in the fourth quarter of that year. Those same statistics report that ten thousand five hundred fifty-six (10,556) foreclosure sales, almost double the number for the prior quarter, were completed just in the month of January 2008. More foreclosures means less money for public safety and other key services.

It is often very difficult to track down the bank or loan company that is responsible for the property. Some of the loan companies sell the loans, some go bankrupt and some are bought out by other loan companies. It sometimes takes six (6) to eight (8) weeks to find the right parties. Because of this delay, it is essential that the notification, fine and lien process set forth herein be expedited.

Passage of the ordinance codified in this Chapter as an urgency measure will enable the Code Enforcement Division to notify the legal owners of such properties in an expeditious manner, thereby beginning the process of reclaiming houses and neighborhoods as soon as possible to prevent public nuisances, neighborhood deterioration, and further decreases in property values. (Ord. 441 (part), 2008)

Sec. 4-17.14 Effective Date.
This Chapter shall become effective immediately upon introduction upon a four-fifths vote pursuant to the authority set forth in Government Code Section 36937(b). The ordinance codified in this Chapter shall be published once within fifteen (15) days in the West County Times, a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Hercules. (Ord. 441 (part), 2008)

The City Council finds that prohibitions on marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing, marijuana usage, marijuana sales, marijuana commercial delivery, and marijuana dispensaries are necessary for the preservation and protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the City and its community, and that such local prohibitions are specifically authorized under State law pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Sections 11362.2 and 26200, and the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”), Section 3, “Purpose and Intent,” subsections (c) and (d).

If the owner fails to start service, the Collector shall give the owner written notification that such service is required.

Sec. 5-2.09 Collector Entitled to Payment.
The Collector shall be entitled to payment from the owner for any collection services rendered by the Collector. Any fees which remain unpaid for collection services for a period of five (5) months or more after the date upon which said services were billed, or sixty (60) days or more after notification by the owner to stop services because the premises are being vacated, may be collected thereafter by the cities as provided herein.

(a) Once a year, or more often as the Council deems appropriate, the City Council shall cause to be prepared a report of delinquent accounts. Information concerning delinquent accounts shall be provided by the Collector. The information shall include evidence that the Collector has mailed the owner a final request for payment for the amounts owed, which may include the month during which the notice was mailed, and a warning notice to pay the collection charges within thirty (30) days or they will be turned over to the City for the commencement of lien proceedings for the amount of such delinquent fees, plus reasonable administrative charges.

(b) In addition to the information as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the report shall include the parcel number of the real property, the name or names of the owner of the real property for which the service was provided on the most recent property assessment rolls of the County Assessor, the address of the property served, the period of service, and the amounts due including reasonable administrative charges, which administrative charges shall be as determined by the Director of Finance. The City Council shall fix a time, date and place for hearing the report, and any objections or protests thereto, as soon as is practicable after receipt of said report.

(c) The City Council shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed to the owners listed on the report not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing.

(d) At the hearing the City Council shall hear any objections or protests of owners liable to be assessed for delinquent fees and administrative charges. The City Council may make such revisions or corrections to the report as it deems just, after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed.

(e) The delinquent fees and charges set forth in the report as confirmed shall constitute special assessments against the respective parcels of land and are a lien on the property for the amount of such delinquent fees and charges. A certified copy of the confirmed report shall thereafter be filed with the County Auditor for the amounts of the respective assessments against the respective parcels of land as they appear on the current assessment roll. The lien created attaches upon recordation, in the office of the County Recorder of the County of Contra Costa, of a certified copy of the resolution of confirmation. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary County ad valorem property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in the case of delinquency as provided for such taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of County ad valorem property taxes shall be applicable to such assessment, except that if any real property to which such lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date in which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent, then the lien which would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to such real property and the delinquent fees, as confirmed, relating to such property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

The Collector may charge the City, at the established collection rates, for those owners who are delinquent. Said charges shall cover the period during which the Collector provided collection and disposal services for the delinquent owner. The City shall not become liable to pay such charges until the charges have been assessed against the owner and the County has disbursed funds covering said charges. (Ord. 239 Div. 1 (part), 1986)

Sec. 5-2.10 Unauthorized Collection Prohibited.
The collection, removal, and disposal of solid waste may be performed by the City, or by any person with whom the City has entered into a contract or franchise agreement for the collection, removal, and disposal thereof, except that residents may dispose of recyclable materials at the Recycling Center for reclamation. It is hereby declared unlawful to remove, convey, or cause to be removed or conveyed any solid waste, including recyclable materials, upon or along any street or alley or any other public place in the City except in conveyances, containers, bins or receptacles that will not permit any waste material to sift or leak through, or fall upon City streets, alleys, highways or waterways. Solid waste conveyed in other than a container or receptacle with a close-fitting lid, or conveyed in containers in accordance with approved methods by state or federal law, shall be protected with covers to prevent the solid waste from being blown or spilled onto the streets, alleys, highways, waterways, or adjacent lands. (Ord. 239 Div. 1 (part), 1986)

No person, firm or corporation shall have or permit upon any premises owned, occupied or controlled by him, any nuisance detrimental to health, or any accumulation of filth, garbage or decaying material, animal or vegetable matter, or any animal or human excrement, and it shall be the duty of the Health Officer of the City to cause any such person, firm or corporation to be notified to abolish and abate such nuisance and remove said matter. In case said person, firm or corporation shall fail, neglect or refuse to remove the same within one (1) day after receiving such notice, such nuisance may be abolished and abated, and such matter removed under and by order of the Health Officer, and the person, firm or corporation whose duty is to abolish or abate said nuisance, or remove said matter, in addition to incurring the penalties in this Chapter provided, shall become indebted to the City for any sum expended by the City for the removal of said matter. (Ord. 239 Div. 1 (part), 1986)

Sec. 5-2.15 Rate and Receptacle Disputes.
In all cases where disputes arise as to the rate charged or to be charged for any service provided in these provisions, or the number or kind of receptacle(s) to be used, the matter shall be referred to the Director of Finance in the City of Hercules and the Director of Finance shall, upon due investigation, determine and fix such rate and receptacle requirement as he may deem just and equitable.

(a) Once each year, or more often as the City Council deems appropriate, the City Council shall cause to be prepared a report of delinquent sewer service charges. The report shall include evidence that the City has mailed the owner a final request for payment for the amounts owed, which final request may include the month during which the notice is mailed, and a warning notice to pay the delinquent charges within thirty (30) days or lien proceedings for the amount of such delinquent sewer service charges, plus reasonable administrative charges, will commence.

(b) In addition to the information set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the report shall include the parcel number of the real property from which the sewer service charges are delinquent, the name(s) of the owner(s) of the real property for which the sewer service was provided as reflected on the most recent equalized assessment roll for Contra Costa County available on the date the report is prepared, the address of the property to which service was provided, the period of service, and the amounts due, including reasonable administrative charges, which administrative charges shall be as determined by the City Manager, the Director of Finance or their designees. The City Council shall fix a time, date and place for hearing the report, and any objections or protests thereto, as soon as practicable after receipt of said report.

(c) The City Council or its designee shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed to the owners listed on the report not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing and shall cause said notice to be published and/or posted pursuant to California Government Code Section 54354.5 as currently in effect or as hereafter amended or other applicable provisions of California law.

(d) At the hearing, the City Council shall hear any objections or protests of owners liable for the delinquent sewer service charges and administrative charges. The City Council may make such revisions or corrections to the report as it deems just, after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed.

(e) The delinquent fees and charges set forth in the report shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of such delinquent sewer service charges and administrative charges. A certified copy of the confirmed report shall thereafter be filed with the Contra Costa County Auditor for the amounts of the respective liens against the respective parcels of land as they appear on the most recent equalized assessment roll for Contra Costa County available on the date the report is prepared. The lien created attaches upon recordation, in the office of the County Recorder of the County of Contra Costa, of a certified copy of the resolution confirming said report. The lien may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary County ad valorem property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in the case of delinquency as provided for such taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of County ad valorem property taxes shall be applicable to such liens, except that if any real property to which such lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date in which the first installment of such taxes would become delinquent, then the lien which would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to such real property and the delinquent sewer service charges, as confirmed, relating to such property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

(f) The remedies provided by this section are cumulative. In lieu of or in addition to the remedies provided above, the City may pursue any rights or remedies allowed under California law including, but not limited to, the following:

(1) The City may have such premises disconnected from the sanitary sewer system. If such disconnection may create a public hazard or nuisance, the City Manager or his/her representatives may enter upon the premises for the purpose of doing such things as may be reasonably necessary to alleviate or mitigate such public hazard or nuisance. The owner of such premises shall have a duty to reimburse the City for all expenses incurred by the City in disconnecting any such premises or in doing other things authorized by this section. No reconnection shall be made to the sanitary sewer system until all charges are paid.

(2) The City may institute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect any charges which may be due and payable in the same manner as other debts owing to the City may be collected or to enforce the lien of the charges. In any such action, reasonable attorney’s fees shall be awarded to the prevailing party. (Ord. 431 § 3, 2007)

Chapter 5. Nonresidential Waste
Article 1. General Provisions

Sec. 5-5.101 Purpose and Policy.
This Chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system for the City of Hercules and enables the City to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws. The objectives of this Chapter are:

(a) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;

(b) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will pass into the receiving waters, the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;

(c) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludge from the system;

(d) To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal wastewater system.

This Chapter provides for the regulation of the contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain users and through enforcement of general requirements for other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established in this Chapter.

(3) Trailer, camper, housecar, or other recreation vehicle wastes;

(4) Pleasure boat washes;

(5) Waste collected in containers or tanks for off-site disposal.

When the City Manager determines that any user (industrial, commercial, or residential) is contributing to the POTW any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the City Manager shall: (1) advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and (2) develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the interference with the POTW. (Ord. 201 § 2.1, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.202 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
Upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the Federal Standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. The City Manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12. (Ord. 201 § 2.2, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.203 Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
Where the City’s wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by Federal Pretreatment Standards, the City may apply to the Regional Water Quality Control Board for modification of specific limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards. Samples shall be taken in accordance with the following:

(a) Influent and effluent operational data shall be representative of yearly and seasonal conditions to which the POTW is subjected for each pollutant for which a discharge limit revision is proposed.

(b) The data shall be representative of the quality and quantity of normal effluent and influent flow of the system;

(c) The data shall be obtained through a composite sample taken on each of three (3) consecutive days during each season. Each composite sample will contain a minimum of twelve (12) discrete samples taken at equal time intervals over the twenty-four (24) hour period and proportional to the flow. More than the minimum number of discrete samples may be required where necessary to determine consistent removal;

(d) Where a composite sample is not an appropriate sampling technique, a grab sample may be taken. Grab samples will be required, for example, where the parameters being evaluated are those, such as cyanide and phenol, which may not be held for any extended period because of biological, chemical, or physical interactions which take place after sample collection and affect the results. A grab sample is an individual sample collected over a period of time not exceeding fifteen (15) minutes. Once prior approval is obtained from the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the City may then modify the pollutant discharge limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part 403, Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. (Ord. 201 § 2.3, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.204 Specific Pollutant Limitations.
(a) Table 5-5.204 represents the “Average Concentration” and “Mass Discharge Limitation for Aggregate Discharges” as allowed.

(b) Any water or waste which contains more than 100 parts per million (ppm), by weight, of oil or grease of petroleum origin; which contains more than 300 ppm, by weight, of fat, oil, or grease of animal or vegetable origin; or which contains grease or oil or other substances that will solidify or become discernible viscous at temperatures between 32° F to 104° F.

(c) Having a pH lower than 6.0 or greater than 9.0 or wastewater having any corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to the POTW or City personnel.

(d) Effluent limitations promulgated by the Federal Act shall apply in any instance where they are more stringent than those in this chapter. The limitations on wastewater strength in this chapter may be supplemented with more stringent limitations under the following circumstances:

(1) If the City Manager determines that the limitations in any section of this chapter may not be sufficient to protect the operation of the City’s or Pinole’s sewerage system; or to comply with the POTW’s NPDES permit;

(2) If the City Manager determines that the limitations in subsection (b) or (c) of this section may not be sufficient to enable the City’s Water Pollution Control Plant to comply with water quality standards or effluent limitations specified in the City’s NPDES permit.

(e) Any discharge which exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the mass discharge limitations listed in Table 5-5.204.

Should the POTW’s current flows exceed these mass flow quantities for any toxicant, then the City Manager may decrease the allowable concentration for that respective toxicant to any prospective user. Conversely, if the POTW’s flows are less than the mass flow quantities for any toxicant, then the City Manager may increase the allowable concentration for the respective toxicant to any prospective user.

The increase in allowable concentration may take the form of a “bubble concept” permit whereby several dischargers or discharge points are considered for their aggregate concentration of constituents. Individual dischargers would be permitted to exceed the allowable concentration (see Table 5-5.204) as long as the sum concentration for the group does not exceed allowable levels.

Sec. 5-5.206 City’s Right of Revision.
The City reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in Section 5-5.101 of this Chapter. (Ord. 201 § 2.6, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.207 Excessive Discharge.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or State. (Ord. 201 § 2.7, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.208 Accidental Discharges.
Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be consistent with EPA practice, and shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or user’s own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be approved by the City before construction of the facility. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.

Written Notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the City Manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, groundwater, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.

Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. (Ord. 201 § 2.8, 1985)

(9) Requirements for notification of accidental slug discharges as per Section 5-5.208 of this Chapter.

(10) Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the City to ensure compliance with this Chapter.

(d) Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued for the specific time period, but in any case, shall be consistent with EPA requirements or Section 5-5.202(c)(10) of this Chapter. All permits may be issued for a period of less than a year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The City Manager may elect to issue a permit for an indefinite period for those land uses within an industrial general area providing they are not significant users and discharge solely domestic waste. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the user’s existing permit. The fee for reissuance of an existing permit where the discharge has not changed shall be Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). If the discharge conditions change, a new permit application and One Thousand Dollar ($1,000) fee shall be required.

The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the City during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in Article 2 of this Chapter are modified or other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.

(e) Permit Transfer. Wastewater Discharge Permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A Wastewater Discharge Permit shall not be reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the approval of the City. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit.

(f) Reporting Requirements for Permittee. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the City Manager, a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants and the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units, in the user facility, which are limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified professional.

Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the City Manager during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the City Manager, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. The City Manager may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. Reporting requirements shall comply with EPA baseline monitoring requirements.

Additionally, the City may require users, other than those subject to pretreatment standards, to submit periodic self-monitoring reports on the discharge including measured flow rates and the results of a sampling and analysis program to demonstrate compliance with the prescribed industrial waste requirements. The samples shall be analyzed by an independent laboratory approved by the State of California Department of Health Services for such analysis as required. The cost of the report and any analysis required shall be borne by the permittee. (Ord. 256 Div. 2, 1987: Ord. 201 § 4.2, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.403 Monitoring Facilities.
The City shall require to be provided and operated at the user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facilities will normally consist of a monitoring manhole with a permanently installed flow meter and recording device. The flow meter shall be approved by the City. The facility will be designed to allow the periodic installation of a composite sampling device to collect samples for the self-monitoring reports. The City reserves the right to require the permanent installation of a sampling device.

The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.

Monitoring facilities may be required by the City Manager even though the discharger may not initially be a significant user or initially be in violation of Article 2 of this Chapter.

The minimum horizontal dimension shall be five feet (5') for manholes in excess of ten feet (10') and shall be four feet (4') for shallower manholes. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow for sampling apparatus and continuous flow measurement in recording devices. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. A 110V power source shall be located within six feet (6') of the facility. The user shall have any sampling apparatus and flow meter instruments calibrated at his own expense at least once every six (6) months, and full-flow calibrated once every three (3) years. This shall be done more frequently if required by the City Manager.

Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facility shall be provided in accordance with the City’s requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed prior to any discharges.

In lieu of continuous measurement, non-significant users may propose the use of water meter readings as a measure of sewer discharge rates. The water meter will be read and recorded as required in the self-monitoring report, and will be used to determine sewer use fees. A monitoring manhole would still be required to allow for periodic wastewater sampling. (Ord. 256 Div. 3, 1987: (Ord. 201 § 4.3, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.404 Inspecting and Sampling.
The City shall inspect the monitoring facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this Chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City or its representative ready access to monitoring facilities at all reasonable times for the purposes of inspection, sampling, and records examination. The City, State, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the User’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City, State, and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. (Ord. 201 § 4.4, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.405 Pretreatment.
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided in accordance with EPA accepted practice and shall be operated and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to the user’s initiation of the changes.

All records relating to compliance with Pretreatment Standards shall be made available to officials of the State or EPA upon request. (Ord. 201 § 4.5, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.406 Confidential Information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.

When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State Disposal System permit and/or the Pretreatment Programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the City until and unless a ten (10) day notification is given to the user. (Ord. 201 § 4.6, 1985)

Article 5. Enforcement

Sec. 5-5.501 Harmful Contributions.
The City may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a Wastewater Contribution Permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the City, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit.

Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the Wastewater Contribution Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The City shall reinstate the Wastewater Contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence. (Ord. 201 § 5.1, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.502. Revocation of Permit.
Any user who violates the following conditions of this Chapter, or applicable state or federal regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this section.

(a) Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge;

(b) Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics;

(c) Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or

(d) Violation of conditions of the permit. (Ord. 201 § 5.2, 1985)

Sec. 5-5.503. Notification of Violation.
Whenever the City finds that any user has violated or is violating this Chapter, his Wastewater Contribution Permit, or any prohibition, limitation, or requirement contained herein, the City may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation.

Chapter 6. Ordinance Prohibiting Smoking in All Workplaces and Public Places
Sec. 5-6.101. Title.
This Chapter shall be known as the City of Hercules Smokefree Ordinance. (Ord. 520 § 2 (part), 2019: Ord. 508 § 1 (part), 2018)

Sec. 5-6.102 Findings and Intent.
The City of Hercules does hereby find that:

(a) According to the 2010 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease, even occasional exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful and low levels of exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke lead to a rapid and sharp increase in dysfunction and inflammation of the lining of the blood vessels, which are implicated in heart attacks and stroke.

(b) According to the 2014 U.S. Surgeon General’s Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress, secondhand smoke exposure causes stroke in nonsmokers. The report also found that since the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health, two million five hundred thousand (2,500,000) nonsmokers have died from diseases caused by tobacco smoke.

(c) Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of approximately fifty-three thousand (53,000) Americans annually.

(d) Based on a finding by the California Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, the California Air Resources Board has determined that secondhand smoke is a toxic air contaminant, finding that exposure to secondhand smoke has serious health effects, including low birth-weight babies; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); increased respiratory infections in children; asthma in children and adults; lung cancer, sinus cancer, and breast cancer in younger, premenopausal women; heart disease; and death.

(e) A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five percent (25%) to fifty percent (50%) higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function.

(f) During periods of active smoking, peak and average outdoor tobacco smoke (OTS) levels measured in outdoor cafes and restaurant and bar patios near smokers rival indoor tobacco smoke concentrations. Nonsmokers who spend six (6) hour periods in outdoor smoking sections of bars and restaurants experience a significant increase in levels of cotinine when compared to the cotinine levels in a smokefree outdoor area.

(g) The dangers of residual tobacco contamination are present in hotels, even in nonsmoking rooms. Compared with hotels that are completely smokefree, surface nicotine and smoke are elevated in nonsmoking rooms of hotels that allow smoking. Hallway surfaces outside of smoking rooms also show higher levels of nicotine than those outside of nonsmoking rooms. Partial smoking restrictions in hotels do not protect non-smoking guests from exposure to tobacco smoke and tobacco-specific carcinogens.

(h) Unregulated high-tech smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or “e-cigarettes,” closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat through an electronic ignition system. Electronic cigarettes produce an aerosol or vapor of undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to the smoke emitted by traditional tobacco products. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that electronic smoking devices not be used indoors, especially in smokefree environments, in order to minimize the risk to bystanders of breathing in the aerosol emitted by the devices and to avoid undermining the enforcement of smokefree laws.

(i) Hookah smoke exposes users to many of the same toxicants found in cigarette smoke.

(j) The Society of Actuaries has determined that secondhand smoke costs the U.S. economy roughly ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000) a year: five billion dollars ($5,000,000,000) in estimated medical costs associated with secondhand smoke exposure and four billion, six hundred million dollars ($4,600,000,000) in lost productivity.

(k) Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smokefree.

(l) Creation of smokefree workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety.

(m) On June 9, 2016, California became the second state to change its tobacco minimum-age sales law to twenty-one (21) years old for tobacco, e-cigarettes and vaping products. (Ord. 520 § 2 (part), 2019: Ord. 508 § 1 (part), 2018)

The Public Works Director shall make a hardship finding only if the requesting property owner presents facts that clearly demonstrate, in the Public Works Director’s sole discretion, that the property owner’s payment for and completion of a building sewer lateral repair or replacement at the required time would result in an undue hardship. If hardship status is granted, the property owner who is selling the property, or the purchaser of such property, shall have no more than one hundred eighty (180) days after the close of escrow or other transfer of the property to repair or replace the building sewer lateral.

Such notice shall specify the repair or replacement necessary to correct the condition and the time in which to make the correction, and shall advise the property owner of the enforcement provisions of this Chapter. If the repairs are not completed within the time allowed by the City, or if the City determines that the property may be transferred before the required testing or repairs can be completed, the City shall record a notice of violation in the official records of Contra Costa County specifying the nature of the violation and the action needed to correct it. The notice shall only be rescinded when the building sewer lateral serving such property has been repaired or replaced to the satisfaction of the City. Recording a notice of violation is in addition to all other remedies available to the City. (Ord. 457 § 1 (part), 2010)

(Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.07 Interpretation of Terms.
(a) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to a franchise agreement as if fully set forth in the franchise agreement, and the express terms of this Chapter will prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement unless such franchise agreement expresses an explicit intent to waive a requirement of this Chapter.

The purpose of the filing fee is to defray a portion of the City’s cost in processing an application. The filing fee is therefore intended to be a charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 542(g)(2)(D), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed pursuant to Section 6-1.14 of this Chapter. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.09 Grant of Franchises.
(a) The City may grant a franchise for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years to serve all or a specified area of the City.

(b) The City may make the grant of a franchise conditioned upon the completion of cable system construction, upgrade or rebuild within a prescribed reasonable time or upon the performance of other specific obligations which are to be reasonable and set forth in the franchise agreement, specifying that failure to comply with the condition will cause the franchise to become null and void without further action by the City.

(c) In evaluating an application for a franchise, the City may consider, among other things, the following factors: the applicant’s technical, financial and legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the nature of the proposed facilities, equipment, and services; the applicant’s experience in constructing and operating cable systems and in providing cable service, including adequate customer service, in other communities, if any; the ability of City streets to accommodate the proposed system; the potential disruption to users of City streets and any resultant inconvenience to the public; and whether the proposal will meet reasonably anticipated community needs and serve the public interest. Where an applicant proposes a competitive cable system, the City may also consider the economic feasibility of multiple cable operators, the impact of grant of a competitive cable system franchise on the ability of an existing franchisee to comply with the terms of its franchise agreement and this Chapter, whether any adverse consequences to the public interest will result if the application is granted, and any other criteria required by applicable Federal or State law.

(d) The City shall consider franchise applications according to the following procedures:

(1) Within sixty (60) days after receipt of a cable franchise application or, where the City issues a request for proposals, within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the period of time during which proposals may be filed, the City Manager shall prepare an analysis of all applications received, including a discussion of the respective merits of each, and present such analysis and the City Manager’s recommendations to the Council at its next regular meeting following expiration of the sixty (60) day period.

(2) Upon receipt of the City Manager’s analysis and recommendations, the Council shall call a public hearing upon the matter of the application or applications, such public hearing to be held not less than twenty (20) days nor more than forty-five (45) days from the date of Council’s receipt of the City Manager’s analysis and recommendations. The City Clerk shall give notice of such public hearing by mailing a copy of the notice of public hearing to each of the franchise applicants at the address shown in its application and to any existing City cable franchisee, and by posting copies of the notice of public hearing in at least three (3) public places in the City; such mailing and posting shall be done not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing.

(e) At the public hearing, the applicant(s), any existing City cable franchisee, and all other interested persons shall be heard. Based upon the application(s), the testimony or other evidence presented at the public hearing, the analysis and recommendations of the City Manager or staff, the criteria set forth in Section 61.09(c) of this Chapter, and any other information relevant to the application(s), the City Council shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny the franchise application(s) and decide the terms and conditions of any franchise(s) granted. Upon the grant of a franchise, the grantee’s application shall become an integral part of the franchise, and the grantee shall be bound by the representations therein made.

(f) If the City grants a franchise application, the City Manager and the grantee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days from the date of the Council resolution making the grant. This period may be extended for good cause by the City. If agreement is not reached with the City Manager within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days from the date of the Council resolution making the grant, or if the period is not extended by the City, the franchise grant will be null and void without further action by the City.

(g) Following at least ten (10) days prior notice to the grantee and the public, the City Council may hold a public hearing at which it will receive comment on the proposed franchise agreement.

(h) After complying with the above requirements, the City Council shall approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by resolution, or may direct that it be subject to further negotiation.

(i) Processing Fee.

(1) If provided for in a franchise agreement, the grant of an initial franchise, a renewed franchise, an application to modify a franchise agreement, or an application to transfer a franchise may be subject to a processing fee in an amount not to exceed the City’s actual reasonable out-of-pocket costs, including all reasonable costs and fees incurred by the City for consultants, analysts and counsel, that the City reasonably determines are necessary to consider the application, less the amount of the filing fee set pursuant to Section 6-1.08(j) of this Chapter. Within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the resolution approving or denying the franchise agreement or modification or transfer thereof by the City Council, the City shall notify the grantee of the amount of any processing fee and its method of calculation. If the processing fee is not paid to the City within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the City Council resolution approving or denying the franchise agreement or a modification or transfer thereof, any approval granted by such resolution will be null and void without further action by the City, unless such period is extended by the City.

(2) The purpose of the processing fee is to recoup the City’s actual reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in processing an application over and above those costs recovered through the filing fee imposed pursuant to Section 6-1.08(i) of this Chapter. The processing fee is therefore intended to be a charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a franchise within the meaning of Section 622(g)(2)(D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 542, and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed pursuant to Section 6-1.14 of this Chapter. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.10 Insurance—Surety— Indemnification.
(a) A franchisee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of the franchise specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the entire length of the franchise period and at its sole cost and expense, the following liability insurance coverage insuring the City and the franchisee:

(1) Workers compensation and employers liability insurance in conformance with the laws of the State of California (not required if franchisee has no employees);

(2) Franchisee’s vehicles, including owned, non-owned (e.g., owned by franchisee’s employees and used in the course and scope of employment), leased or hired vehicles, shall each be covered with automobile liability insurance in the minimum amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit per accident for bodily injury and property damage;

(3) Franchisee shall obtain and maintain comprehensive or commercial general liability insurance coverage in the minimum aggregate annual amount of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit, including bodily injury, personal injury, and broad form property damage. Such insurance coverage shall include, without limitation:

A. Contractual liability coverage adequate to meet a franchisee’s indemnification obligations under this Chapter, as amended, and a franchisee’s franchise agreement, and

B. A cross-liability clause;

(4) Franchisee shall obtain and maintain slander/libel/defamation/broadcaster’s general liability insurance in the minimum aggregate annual amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000);

(5) Franchisee may satisfy the foregoing coverages by any combination of specific liability and excess liability policies.

(b) All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do business in the State of California, shall be with sureties with an A-1 or better rating of insurance by Best’s Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; and in a form reasonably approved by the City Attorney. The City may require coverage and amounts in excess of the above minimums where necessary in view of the franchisee’s greater exposure to liability.

(c) All insurance policies shall be available for review by the City, and a franchisee shall keep on file with the City certificates of insurance.

(d) All insurance policies shall name the City, its officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees as additional insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in coverage shall not be effective unless sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof has been given to the City.

(e) A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, save and hold harmless, and defend the City, its officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against any and all claims, suits, costs, demands, losses, causes of action, proceedings and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out of the construction, maintenance or operation of its cable system, or in any way arising out of the franchisee’s enjoyment or exercise of a franchise granted hereunder, regardless of the cause and regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter or a franchise agreement. This provision includes, but is not limited to, claims arising out of copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or franchisees of programs to be delivered by the cable system.

(f) A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City, its officers, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, liability and judgments for damages or otherwise subject to Section 638 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 558, arising out of or alleged to arise out of any claim against the franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, libel, defamation or slander of any person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of any person, firm or corporation. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.11 Security Fund.
(a) Prior to the franchise becoming effective, the franchisee shall post with the City a security deposit in an amount of not less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) to be used as a security fund to ensure the faithful performance of all provisions of this Chapter, the franchise agreement, and other applicable law, and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of the City, and the payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the City which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system. A franchise agreement may provide for a security fund greater than the minimum specified in this subsection where the City determines, under circumstances existing at the time, that such larger security fund is necessary to protect the public or to provide adequate incentive to the franchisee to comply with this Chapter and the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement shall provide for the procedures to be followed with respect to the security fund.

(b) The rights reserved to the City with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by this Chapter or authorized by other law or the franchise agreement, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund will affect any other right the City may have. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.12 Performance Bond.
(a) A franchise agreement may provide that, prior to any cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the streets, a franchisee shall establish in the City’s favor a performance bond in an amount specified in the franchise agreement or other authorization as necessary to ensure the franchisee’s faithful performance of the construction, upgrade, or other work, but the amount of such performance bond shall not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated cost of the street work and repair associated with such construction, upgrade or other work. The franchisee shall submit an estimate of such cost to the City for the City’s approval. The amount of the performance bond shall be specified in the franchise agreement.

(b) In the event a franchisee subject to such a performance bond fails to substantially complete the cable system construction, upgrade or other work in the streets in a safe, timely and competent manner in accord with the provisions of the franchise agreement, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or the cost of completing or repairing the system construction, upgrade or other work in the streets, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys’ fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The performance bond may also be used to cover the cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee in the case of abandonment pursuant to Section 6-1.19 hereof.

(c) The franchise agreement may specify that upon completion of the system construction, upgrade or other work in the streets and payment of all construction obligations of the cable system to the satisfaction of the City, the City may eliminate the bond or reduce its amount. However, the City may subsequently require an increase in the bond amount or a new bond for any subsequent construction, upgrade or other work in the streets. In any event, the total amount of the bond shall not exceed the amount specified in subsection (a) of this Section.

(d) The performance bond shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney, and shall contain the following endorsement:

This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty (60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew.

(e) The rights reserved by the City with respect to any performance bond established pursuant to this Section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the City may have under this Chapter, the franchise agreement, or at law or equity.

(f) If so provided for in its franchise agreement, a franchisee may provide a bank letter of credit in lieu of the performance bond in a form reasonably approved by the City Manager. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.13 Minimum Facilities and Services.
(a) The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply to all franchises granted by the City. The City may require in a franchise agreement that a franchisee exceed these minimum requirements where it reasonably determines, under circumstances existing at the time of the application, that the additional requirements are necessary to meet cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.

(1) Any cable system that is constructed, upgraded, or reconstructed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter, as amended, shall (a) be able to pass frequencies of at least 550 MHz; (b) have a minimum channel capacity of at least seventy-seven (77) video channels; (c) have at least sixty (60) video channels activated; provided, however, that a franchisee shall not be required to provide sixty (60) activated channels unless sufficient programming services of the type generally carried by a cable system are available; and (d) have two-way capability. A franchise agreement may provide for a larger minimum channel capacity requirement.

(2) The City may require that a franchisee provide access channels for public, educational and/or governmental use.

(3) A cable system shall provide leased access channels as required by federal law.

(4) A franchisee may be required to provide basic cable service without charge to all facilities within the City passed by the cable system that are owned or predominantly occupied by the City or an educational institution and devoted to predominantly educational or governmental use. Such cable service shall be provided by means of drops extending to each building selected by the City or the educational institution. Each such drop shall provide all basic services available over the cable system, with the exception of optionally charged premium services. The franchisee shall not be required to extend a drop to a facility of the City or educational institution more than two hundred (200) feet from the cable distribution line, unless the City or the educational institution being served agrees to bear the expense of any additional extension beyond that point. A franchisee may be required in a franchise agreement to extend a drop internally to particular locations within City or educational institution facilities; provided, however, that a franchisee shall be reimbursed for such external extensions at franchisee’s actual costs. Any drop that is internally extended by the City or the educational institution shall be inspected for signal leakage by the franchisee, at no cost to the City or the educational institution, to ensure they meet all FCC requirements relative to signal leakage. The cost of repairing any signal leakage on such internal extensions will be the responsibility of the City or the educational institution.

(5) A franchisee shall design its system to allow the City to interrupt cable service in an emergency to deliver necessary information to subscribers. The City shall hold the franchisee harmless from any damage or misuse of emergency override capabilities by the City or its officers, agents or employees.

(6) A franchisee shall make available to its subscribers at cost equipment capable of decoding closed circuit captioning information for the hearing impaired.

(7) Standard installation shall consist of an underground drop, not exceeding two hundred (200) feet, to a subscriber’s residence or place of commercial or industrial business. Residential or commercial business drops in excess of two hundred (200) feet may be charged according to the franchisee’s rate schedule.

(b) Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a franchisee shall make cable service available to every dwelling and commercial place of business within the franchisee’s service area; provided, however, that a potential subscriber with a non-standard installation shall pay the cost of installation to the extent it exceeds the cost of a standard installation. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.14 Franchise Fee.
(a) A franchisee, as compensation for the privilege granted under a franchise for the use of the City’s streets to construct and operate a cable system, shall pay to the City a franchise fee in an amount up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the franchisee’s gross revenues derived from the operation of its cable system within the City during the term of its franchise.

(b) A franchisee shall pay the franchise fee due to the City on a quarterly basis. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the City not later than the last day of the following quarter.

(d) No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable.

(e) A franchisee shall file within three (3) months following the end of each of its fiscal years a statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding year and a detailed explanation of the method of computation. The statement shall be certified by a certified public accountant or the franchisee’s chief financial officer. The franchisee will bear the cost of the preparation of such statements.

(f) The City may, from time to time, upon reasonable notice, but not more than once every six (6) months, inspect and audit any and all books and records of the franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of franchise fees due, and may recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise. The cost of the audit will be borne by the City, unless the audit shows an underpayment of more than five percent (5%), in which case franchisee shall bear the cost of the audit. The audit shall be performed in the City or within western Contra Costa County, and it shall be the responsibility of the franchisee to have all books and records necessary to satisfactorily perform the audit readily available to the auditors.

(g) In the event that a franchise fee payment is not received by the City on or before the due date set forth in subsection (b) above, or is underpaid, the franchisee will be charged interest from the due date at an interest rate equal to three percent (3%) above the rate for three-month Federal treasury bills at the most recent United States Treasury Department sale of such treasury bills occurring prior to the date of the due date of the franchise fee payment. In addition, the franchisee will pay a late charge of twelve percent (12%) of the amount of the unpaid or underpaid franchise fee payment if the amount in question is not paid within thirty (30) days of written demand by the City.

(h) When a franchise terminates for whatever reason, the franchisee shall file with the City within ninety (90) calendar days of the date its operations in the City cease a financial statement, certified by a certified public accountant or the franchisee’s chief financial officer, showing the gross revenues received by the franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments will be made at that time for franchise fees due to the date that the franchisee’s operations ceased. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Such records shall be retained for a period of at least two (2) years. If, after two (2) years, franchisee wishes to dispose of such records, franchisee shall, at the City’s request, turn such records over to the City.

(k) Upon the failure of a franchisee to complete any work required by law or by the provisions of this Chapter within the time prescribed and to the satisfaction of the City Manager, the City Manager may cause such work to be done, and the franchisee shall pay to the City the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an itemized statement from the City.

(l) In the event a franchisee shall fail to comply with any of the provisions of this Section, the amount of the itemized statement referred to in subsection (k) hereof shall be recovered from the security fund pursuant to Section 6-1.11 of this Chapter or the performance bond pursuant to Section 6-1.12 of this Chapter.

(Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

(b) A cable system shall be capable of delivering all National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) color and monochrome standards signals and designed to provide picture quality of TASO Grade 2 or better and superior reliability.

(1) At franchisee’s expense, on the last regular working day of each calendar quarter, a franchisee shall submit to the City Manager system performance data taken within the previous seven (7) days.

Sec. 6-1.22 Enforcement Remedies.
(a) In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the City has the right to apply any one (1) or combination of the following remedies in the event a franchisee violates this Chapter, its franchise agreement or applicable State or Federal law:

(1) Impose liquidated damages in such amount, whether on a per diem, per incident, or other measure of violation, as provided in the franchise agreement. Payment of liquidated damages by the franchisee will not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to comply with the franchise agreement or the requirements of this Chapter.

(2) Reduce the duration of the franchise on such basis as the City determines is reasonable pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 6-1.25 of this Chapter.

(3) Revoke the franchise pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 6-1.25 of this Chapter.

(b) In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the City shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person or persons bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the City determines are appropriate to the public interest.

(c) In addition to or instead of any other remedy, the City may seek legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Sec. 6-1.23 Renewal of Franchise.
Renewal shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the Cable Act. The following additional requirements shall apply:

(a) Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth in Section 626(a)(1)(2) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 546, should that process be invoked, the City shall notify the franchisee that it may file a renewal application. The notice shall specify the information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application, which shall be no earlier than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of the notice.

(1) The application shall comply with the requirements of Section 6-1.08 of this Chapter and provide the specific information requested in the notice, and any other applicable information required in Section 6-1.08(f) of this Chapter. If the franchisee does not submit a renewal application by the date specified in the City’s notice to the franchisee given pursuant to this subsection, the franchisee will be deemed not to be seeking renewal of its franchise, unless good cause is shown by the franchisee for its failure to submit a timely application and franchisee submits an application as promptly as possible thereafter.

(2) Upon receipt of the renewal application, the City shall publish notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The City, following at least seventy-two (72) hours’ prior public notice, may hold one or more public hearings on the renewal application.

(b) In the event a public hearing on the renewal application is held, or in the event that the Council considers the renewal application without a public hearing, the Council will either:

(1) Pass a resolution approving renewal of the franchise, subject to the negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the City and the franchisee; or

(2) Pass a resolution making a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed.

(c) If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the City will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 546(c), to address the issues set forth in Sections 626(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Sections 546(c) (1)(A) through (D).

(d) Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for renewal not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a), shall be deemed an informal proposal for renewal and shall be governed in accordance with Section 626(h) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. Section 546(h). The City may hold one (1) or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an informal proposal for renewal may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the Council shall, after public notice and hearing, determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal.

(e) If the Council grants a renewal application, the City and the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures specified in subsections 6-1.09(f) through (i) of this Chapter, before such renewal becomes effective.

(f) If renewal of a franchise is denied, a franchisee shall have one (1) year to sell the system to a qualified buyer, such sale being subject to the issuance of a franchise to the buyer pursuant to the terms of this chapter. During such one-year period, a franchisee shall comply with the terms of its franchise agreement and this Chapter. If the franchisee fails to sell the system within such one-year period, the City may acquire ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another person upon approval of the council. Any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value. For purposes of this subsection, “fair market value” shall be defined as the price in terms of money which the franchisee’s cable system will bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. The fair market value shall be determined for all purposes under this subsection on the basis of the cable system as a going concern, but with the franchise itself valued as if it were three (3) years in duration or for the remainder of the actual term of any franchise still in existence, whichever is less, and with an expectation of renewal to which the franchisee is entitled pursuant to the terms of this Chapter and its franchise agreement at the time of the valuation.

(g) If renewal of a franchise is denied and the franchisee does not sell the system to a qualified buyer within a year and the City does not purchase the cable system or approve or effect a transfer of the cable system to another person, the City may require the former franchisee’s facilities and equipment removed at the former franchisee’s expense pursuant to Section 6-1.19 of this Chapter.

(h) If the Cable Act, or the renewal provisions thereof, are repealed or if for any other reason there is no Federal law concerning cable franchise renewals, then a franchise shall be renewed unless the Council reasonably determines, after affording the franchisee and the public notice and an opportunity to be heard, that:

(1) The franchisee has not substantially complied with the material terms of its existing franchise or with other applicable law;

(2) The quality of the franchisee’s service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, billing practices and level of service, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has not been reasonable in light of community needs;

(3) The franchisee does not have the financial, legal, or technical ability to provide the services, facilities and equipment to meet the community’s future cable-related needs and interests; or

(4) The franchisee has not made a renewal proposal that is reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs of the community, taking into account the costs of meeting such needs and interests. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.24 Transfers.
(a) A franchise is a privilege held in personal trust by the franchisee. No transfer of a franchise shall occur without prior approval of the City.

(b) An application for a transfer of a franchise shall meet the requirements of Sections 6-1.08(a), (b), (c), (i) and (j) of this Chapter, and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee. At a minimum, the information required in Sections 6-1.08(e)(1) through (e)(5) and (e)(14) of this Chapter shall be provided with respect to the proposed transferee. The information required in Sections 6-1.08 (e)(6) through (e)(13) and (e)(15) of this Chapter shall also be provided whenever the proposed transferee expects material changes to occur in those areas.

(c) An application for approval of a pro forma transfer of a franchise shall be considered granted on the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following the filing of such application with the City unless, prior to that date, the City notifies the franchisee to the contrary. An application for approval of a pro forma transfer of a franchise shall clearly identify the application as such.

(d) In making a determination on whether to grant an application for a transfer of a franchise, the Council shall consider the legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee to operate the system; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this Chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee’s commitment to cure such non-compliance; and whether operation by the transferee would substantially and adversely affect cable services to subscribers, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest. In considering whether operation by the transferee would substantially and adversely affect cable services to subscribers, the City may consider the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates, unless the transferee agrees in writing that, during the remaining term of the franchise, it will not charge rates for “basic cable service” or any “cable programming service” (as those terms are defined in the Cable Act) in excess of the average of rates of nonaffiliated systems in the area offering comparable service.

(e) No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this Chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations and liabilities of the previous franchisee under this chapter and the franchise agreement.

(f) Approval by the City of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the City under this Chapter or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer.

(g) The City may impose a reasonable processing fee to cover its actual costs in excess of the filing fee in considering an application for transfer of a franchise. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.25 Revocation or Termination of Franchise.
(a) Any franchise may be revoked, terminated, or its term shortened by the Council in the event that the Council shall have found, after notice and public hearing as provided in subsection (b), that the franchisee has failed to comply with any material provision of this Chapter or has breached any material term or condition of its franchise agreement, and the Council further finds that franchisee has not taken or is not actively and expeditiously pursuing action to correct and cure such non-compliance or breach within a reasonable period after the City has given franchisee written notice of such failure to comply or breach.

(b) Prior to revoking or terminating a franchise or shortening its term pursuant to subsection (a), the Council shall hold a public hearing, upon sixty (60) calendar days notice, at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the public hearing the Council may determine whether to revoke the franchise or reduce its term based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the analysis and recommendations of the City Manager, other relevant information, and the public interest. If the Council determines to revoke a franchise or shorten its term, it shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision. A copy of such decision shall be transmitted to the franchisee, which shall have the right to contest the reasonableness of such decision on the merits in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(c) Any franchise may, at the option of the City following a public hearing before the Council, be revoked one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one hundred twenty (120) day period:

(1) Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or

(2) Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the franchise agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Chapter and the franchise agreement.

(d) In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the City may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the Council, by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless:

(1) The City has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); and

(2) The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the City to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this Chapter.

(e) If the City revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective:

(1) The City may follow the provisions of Section 6-1.19 of this Chapter.

(2) The City, by resolution of the Council, may acquire ownership or effect a transfer of the cable system at an equitable price if the franchise agreement so provides.

(3) If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the City may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system.

(f) Where the City has issued a franchise specifically conditioned in the franchise agreement upon the completion of construction or system upgrade or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the franchisee to substantially complete such construction or upgrade, or to comply with such other specific obligation as required, may result in the automatic forfeiture of the franchise without further action by the City where the franchise agreement specifically provides for such forfeiture, unless the City, at its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an extension of time. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.26 Arbitration.
(a) No matter or dispute between the City and a franchisee relating to a franchise agreement may be arbitrable unless specifically provided for in the franchise agreement or otherwise agreed upon by the City and the franchisee. Any matter that is arbitrable under the specific provisions of a franchise agreement may be subjected to the arbitration procedures set forth in subsection (b) below.

(b) The arbitration procedure employed shall be consistent with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The City and the franchisee will each select a qualified arbitrator. The two (2) persons selected shall select a third qualified arbitrator, and the three (3) arbitrators will constitute a panel whose decision is binding on the City and the franchisee. The fees of the first two (2) arbitrators shall be paid by the party selecting such person, and the third person shall be compensated one-half (1/2) by the City and one-half (1/2) by the franchisee. The general costs of the proceeding shall be shared equally by the City and the franchisee. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.27 Continuity of Service Mandatory.
(a) It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available services from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied.

(b) In the event of a termination or transfer of a franchise for whatever reason, the franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. The franchisee shall cooperate with the City to operate the system for a temporary period following termination or transfer as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. The temporary period will not exceed six (6) months without the franchisee’s written consent. During such period the cable system shall be operated under such terms and conditions as the City and the franchisee may agree, or such other terms and conditions that will continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator.

(c) In the event a franchisee fails to operate the system for seven (7) consecutive days without prior approval of the City or without just cause, the City may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the City or until a permanent operator is selected. If the City is required to fulfill this obligation for the franchisee, the franchisee shall reimburse the City for all costs or damages resulting from the franchisee’s failure to perform. Additionally, in the event a franchisee ceases to operate the system and the City is therefore required to do so, the franchisee will cooperate with the City to allow City employees and/or City agents necessary access to the franchisee’s facilities and premises for purposes of continuing system operation. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.28 Rates.
(a) At such time as Federal and State law permit regulation of a franchisee’s rates or charges, the City reserves all rights to implement and impose such regulation, and may do so by amendment to this Chapter, by separate ordinance, by amendment to a franchise agreement, or in any other lawful manner.

(b) Nothing in this Chapter shall prohibit the City from regulating rates for cable services, installation or equipment to the full extent permitted by law.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City and a franchisee may reach mutual agreement concerning rates to the extent permitted by law.

(d) A franchisee may not change rates or charges without giving a minimum thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice to the City and all subscribers. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.29 Disconnection.
(a) If a franchisee charges a subscriber a fee for downgrade or discontinuance of service, such fee shall not exceed the franchisee’s actual out-of-pocket costs incurred for implementing such downgrade or discontinuance of service.

(b) If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber or other fee or charge, the franchisee may disconnect the subscriber’s service outlet; however, such disconnection shall not be effected until forty-five (45) days after the due date of the monthly subscriber fee or other charge, and after ten (10) days advance written notice of intent to disconnect to the subscriber in question. If the subscriber pays within forty-five (45) days of the due date and after notice of disconnection has been given, the franchisee shall not disconnect. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the franchisee shall reinstate service. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.30 Access Channels and Facilities.

(c) The City may, at any time and in its sole discretion, delegate responsibility for developing, managing, administering or utilizing any access channel or access channels to one (1) or more DAOs. Upon a franchisee’s consent, and upon terms and conditions mutually agreed on by the City and a franchisee, whether in a franchise agreement or otherwise, the City may delegate responsibility for developing, managing, administering or utilizing any access channel or access channels to a franchisee. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.31 Administration.
(a) The City Manager, either directly or through a duly appointed designee, shall have the responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day administration of this Chapter and franchise agreements. The City Manager shall be empowered to take all administrative actions on behalf of the City, except for those actions specified in this Chapter that are reserved to the Council. The City Manager may recommend that the Council take certain actions with respect to the franchise. The City Manager shall keep the Council apprised of developments in cable and provide the Council with assistance, advice and recommendations as appropriate.

(b) The Council shall have the sole authority to regulate rates for cable services as provided by law, grant franchises, authorize the entering into of franchise agreements, modify franchise agreements, renew franchises, revoke franchises, and authorize the transfer of a franchise; provided, however, the City Manager may act on applications for a pro forma transfer of a franchise. (Ord. 317 § 1 (part), 1993)

Sec. 6-1.32 Applicability.

(2) The reason for each such claim of non-applicability.

Sec. 6-1.33 Reservation of Rights.

(c) The City reserves the right to exercise the power of eminent domain to the extent permitted by law.

The notice shall state clearly the reasons why the Director’s decision should be overturned. The Council shall only hear the appeal if the notice is filed and all required fees are paid within the ten (10) day appeal period. Once a notice of appeal has been filed it may be withdrawn by the State franchise holder prior to the distribution of public hearing notices, but not thereafter.

(7) The Director shall transmit the entire record concerning the permit application to the Council.

(8) Appeal hearings shall be conducted in the same manner as public hearings per Section 44.300 of the zoning ordinance. When hearing the appeal, the Council shall consider the record and such additional evidence as may be offered by anyone and may affirm, modify or reverse, in whole or in part, the determination appealed from, or make and substitute such other determination as is warranted, or may remand to the Director for further review and determination. The State franchise holder bears the burden of proof before the Council to prove that one (1) or more reasons exist on the appeal for reversing or modifying the Director’s decision.

(9) The issuance of a permit is not a franchise, and does not grant any vested rights in any location in the public rights-of-way, or in any particular manner of placement within the rights-of-way. Without limitation, a permit to place cabinets and similar appurtenances aboveground may be revoked and the permittee required to place facilities underground, in accordance with applicable law.

(f) Emergency Alert System. Each State franchise holder shall comply with the emergency alert system requirements of the Federal Communications Commission in order that emergency messages may be distributed over the State franchise holder’s network. To the extent consistent with Public Utilities Code Section 5880, each State franchise holder shall install and maintain an audio override on all channels for transmission of emergency messages and alerts, and shall provide for character-generated “crawl” information to be superimposed on all channels for the hearing impaired, as such capability was required under local franchises in effect in the City on January 1 to December 30, 2006.

(g) Public, Educational, and Government Access Channel Capacity, Support, Interconnection, and Signal Carriage.

(1) PEG Channel Capacity.

B. A State franchise holder shall provide an additional PEG channel when the standards set forth in Section 5870(d) of the California Public Utilities Code are satisfied by the City or any entity designated by the City to manage one (1) or more of the PEG channels.

(2) PEG Support.

A. Amount of PEG Support Fee. Any State franchise holder shall pay to the City—or if directed by the City, to the City’s designated PEG provider—a PEG fee equal to one percent (1%) of gross revenues.

B. The PEG support fee shall be used for PEG purposes in a manner that is consistent with State and Federal law.

C. A State franchise holder shall remit the PEG support fee quarterly, within forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter. Each payment made shall be accompanied by a summary, detailing how the PEG support fee was calculated.

D. In the event that a State franchise holder fails to pay the PEG support fee when due, or underpays the proper amount due, the State franchise holder shall pay interest at the rate per year equal to the highest prime lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus one percent (1%), or the maximum rate specified by State law.

(3) PEG Carriage and Interconnection.

A. As set forth in Sections 5870(b) and 5870(g)(3) of the California Public Utilities Code, State franchise holders shall ensure that all PEG channels are receivable by all subscribers, whether they receive digital or analog service, or a combination thereof, without the need for any equipment other than that needed to receive the lowest cost tier of service. PEG access capacity provided by a State franchise holder shall be of similar quality and functionality to that offered by commercial channels (unless the PEG signal is provided to the State franchise holder at a lower quality or with less functionality), shall be capable of carrying a National Television System Committee (NTSC) television signal, and shall be carried on the State franchise holder’s lowest cost tier of service. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited by Federal law. After the initial designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without the agreement of the City unless Federal law requires the change.

B. Where technically feasible, each State franchise holder and each incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by any means authorized under Public Utilities Code Section 5870(h). Each State franchise holder and incumbent cable operator shall provide interconnection of PEG channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not withhold the interconnection. If a State franchise holder and an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement for PEG carriage, the City may require the incumbent cable operator to allow each State franchise holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent cable operator’s network at a technically feasible point on the State franchise holder’s network as identified by the State franchise holder. If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available, each State franchise holder shall make interconnection available to each PEG channel originator programming a channel in the City and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by each State franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

(h) Notices.

(1) Each State franchise holder or applicant for a State franchise shall file with the City a copy of all applications or notices that the State franchise holder or applicant is required to file with the California Public Utilities Commission.

(2) Unless otherwise specified in this Section, all notices or other documentation that a State franchise holder is required to provide to the City under this Section or the California Public Utilities Code shall be provided to both the City Manager and the City staff person in charge of cable and telecommunications, or their successors or designees.

Article 2. Permits, Fees and Bonds

Sec. 7-1.201 Issuing Authority.
The written permits required by this Chapter shall be issued by the Public Works Department, subject to the provisions of this Chapter and other applicable laws.

Sec. 7-1.202 Application.
The Director of Public Works shall prescribe and provide a regular form of application for the use of applicants for permits required by this Chapter. The application shall show such information and detail as the Director of Public Works may deem necessary to establish the exact location, nature, dimensions, duration and purpose of the proposed use or encroachment.

Sec. 7-1.203 Exhibits.
When required by the Director of Public Works, the application shall be accompanied by maps, sketches, diagrams or similar exhibits to the size and in the quantity as the Director of Public Works may prescribe, sufficient to clearly illustrate the location, dimensions, nature and purpose of the proposed encroachment and its relation to existing and proposed facilities in the right-of-way or water course.

Sec. 7-1.204 Consent of Public Agencies.
The applicant shall also enclose with, attach or add to the application the written order or consent to any work thereunder which may be required by law to be obtained. A permit shall not be issued unless such order or consent is first obtained and evidence thereof is filed with the Director of Public Works. The permittee shall keep himself adequately informed of all State and Federal laws and City laws and regulations which in any manner affect the permit. The applicant shall at all times comply with, and cause all his agents and employees to comply with, all such laws, regulations, decisions, court and other similar authoritative orders.

Sec. 7-1.205 Action on Application.
Applications may be approved, conditionally approved, or denied. When the Director of Public Works finds that the application is in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter, he shall issue a permit for the use or encroachment, attaching such conditions as he may deem necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the public and for the protection of the City. If the Director of Public Works finds the application is in conflict with the provisions of this Chapter, he shall deny the permit, giving in writing the reasons for such denial.

Sec. 7-1.206 Permit Form and Validity.
Permits shall be written on a form prescribed by the Director of Public Works. No permit shall be valid unless signed by the Director of Public Works or his authorized representative.

Sec. 7-1.207 Permit Term: Commencement of Work.
The permittee shall begin the work or use authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this Chapter within ninety (90) days from the date of issuance unless a different period is stated in the permit. If the work or use is not begun accordingly, the permit shall become void.

Sec. 7-1.208 Permit Term: Continuing Use.
A permit for a temporary encroachment as determined by the Director of Public Works, for continuing a use or maintaining a temporary encroachment previously authorized, shall be valid for a term of one (1) year from the date of issuance unless the permit specifies otherwise or unless sooner terminated by discontinuance of the use, removal of the encroachment, or termination of the permit by written order of the Director of Public Works mailed thirty (30) days prior to the date of termination.

Sec. 7-1.209 Permit Term: Completion of Work.
The permittee shall complete the work or use authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this Chapter within the time specified in the permit. If at any time the Director of Public Works finds that the delay in the prosecution or completion of the work or use authorized is due to lack of diligence on the part of the permittee, he may cancel the permit and restore the right of way or water course to its former condition. The permittee shall reimburse the City for all expenses incurred by the City in restoring the right of way or water course.

Sec. 7-1.210 Display of Permit.
The permittee shall keep any permit issued pursuant to this Chapter at the site of the work, or in the cab of a vehicle when movement thereof on a public street is involved, and the permit shall be shown to any authorized representative of the Director of Public Works or law enforcement officer on demand.

A permit issued for continued use or maintenance of an encroachment may be kept at the place of business of the permittee or otherwise safeguarded during the term of validity but shall be made available to an authorized representative of the Director of Public Works or law enforcement officer within a reasonable time after demand therefor is made.

Sec. 7-1.211 Non-assignment of Permit.
Permits shall be issued only to the person making application therefor and may not be assigned to another person by the permittee. If any permittee assigns his permit to another, the permit shall become void.

Sec. 7-1.212 Changes in Permit and Work.
No changes may be made in the location, dimension, character, or duration of the encroachment or use as granted by the permit except upon written authorization of the Director of Public Works; provided, however, the location of underground pipes or conduits smaller than six (6") inches in diameter shall be exempt from this requirement. No permit shall be required for the continuing use or maintenance of encroachments installed by public utilities or for changes therein or thereto when such changes or additions require no excavation of the right of way.

Sec. 7-1.213 Fees.
The schedule of fees shall be those recommended by the Director of Public Works and established and adopted by the Council from time to time by resolution. Before a permit shall be issued, the applicant shall deposit with the City cash or a check in a sufficient sum to cover the fee for issuance of the permit, charges for field investigation, and the fees for necessary inspections, all in accordance with the schedule established and adopted by the Council.

When work for which a permit is required is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining such permit, the fees specified shall be doubled.

Public utilities and public agencies may, at the option of the Director of Public Works, make payment for the charges billed by the City instead of by advance deposit as required by this section.

Sec. 7-1.214 Effect of Acceptance.
Acceptance by the applicant of the permit granted shall be conclusive evidence of the reasonableness of the terms imposed and shall constitute a waiver of any right of other determination thereof.

Sec. 7-1.215 Cash Deposits.
Unless the provisions of this section are waived in the permit, and before a permit is effective, the permittee shall deposit with the Public Works Department cash or a certified or cashier’s check in a sum to be fixed by the Director of Public Works as sufficient to reimburse the City for costs of restoring the right of way or water course to its former condition, based on the schedule adopted by resolution of the Council; provided, however, the permittee may file a cash deposit on an annual basis in a sum estimated by the Director of Public Works as sufficient to cover his activities during any twelve (12) month period.

Sec. 7-1.216 Bond in Lieu of Cash Deposit.
In lieu of the cash deposit prescribed by Section 7-1.215 of this Article the permittee may, upon approval by the Director of Public Works, file a cash deposit in the minimum sum established by the schedule adopted by the Council and in effect at the time of application for a permit, and the balance of the sum fixed by the Director of Public Works as sufficient to reimburse the City for expenses incurred in restoring the right of way or water course to its former condition may be filed in the form of an approved surety bond issued by a company authorized to do a general surety business in the State.

Sec. 7-1.217 Bond Payable to City.
Any bond or cash deposit required by the Director of Public Works pursuant to this Chapter shall be filed with the Public Works Department and shall be payable to the City. Upon satisfactory completion of all work authorized in the permit, and fulfillment of all conditions of the permit, the bond or cash deposit shall be released upon the expiration of ninety (90) days from the date of completion.

Sec. 7-1.218 Exclusions.
Cash deposits or bonds shall not be required of any public utility or public agency which is authorized by law to establish or maintain any works or facilities in, under or over any public street or right of way.

Sec. 7-1.219 Liability.
The permittee shall be responsible for all liability imposed by law for personal injury or property damage proximately caused by work permitted and done by the permittee under permit or proximately caused by failure on the permit-tee’s part to perform his obligations under such permit in respect to maintenance. If any claim of such liability is made against the City, its officers or employees, the permittee shall defend, indemnify and hold them, and each of them harmless from such claim insofar as permitted by law.

Article 3. Performance of Work

Sec. 7-1.301 Public Safety.
The permittee, in the conduct of the work, use or maintenance of an encroachment authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this Chapter, shall provide, erect and/or maintain such lights, barriers, warning signs, patrols, watchmen and other safeguards as are necessary to protect the traveling public. Any omission on the part of the Director of Public Works to specify in the permit what lights, barriers or other protective measures or devices shall be provided, erected or maintained by the permittee, or the fact that the Director of Public Works or his representative may not specify sufficient lights, barriers or other protective measures or devices, shall not excuse the permittee from complying with all requirements of law and appropriate regulations and ordinances for adequately protecting the safety of those using public streets. If at any time the Director of Public Works finds that suitable safeguards are not being provided, the City may provide, erect, maintain, relocate or remove such safeguards as are deemed necessary, or may cancel the permit and restore the right of way to its former condition, all at the expense of the permittee.

A permittee making any excavation, or erecting or leaving any obstruction within, under or upon the right of way, or causing the same to be made, erected or left, shall place and maintain lights at each end of the excavation or obstruction at not more than fifty (50) foot intervals along the excavation of obstruction from one-half (1/2) hour before sunset of each day to one-half (1/2) hour after sunrise of the next day until the excavation is entirely refilled or the obstruction is removed and the right of way is made safe for use. Reflectorized warning signs conforming to the requirements of the Division of Highways of the State shall be placed 100 feet in advance of any obstruction or excavation within the traveled way in such a position as to adequately warn vehicular traffic, and on major streets additional similar signs shall be placed 400 feet in advance of construction.

The warning signs, lights and other safety devices shall conform to and be placed as required by the applicable requirements of the Vehicle Code of the State and to any sign manual used by the Department of Public Works of the State, and to the standard specifications of the City.

Unless specifically permitted by the Director of Public Works, open trenches in excess of 300 feet in advance of the pipe line operation shall not be permitted. In no case shall there be more than 500 feet of open trench at any one time.

Sec. 7-1.302 Maintaining Traffic.
The permittee shall give particular attention to facilitating the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Unless prior written approval is obtained from the Director of Public Works, the permittee shall not:

(a) Obstruct more than one-half (1/2) the area used by vehicles;

(b) Obstruct a driveway approach on a developed property except that, under unusual circumstances and with forewarning to the occupant of the affected property, a driveway approach may be obstructed for a limited period of time provided the permittee’s construction personnel are present within 400 feet of the obstructed driveway; or

(c) Obstruct the area between the curb (or the shoulder if there is no curb) and the right of way line in such a way as to create a hazardous path for pedestrians.

The use of flagmen shall be mandatory when either the two (2) way vehicular traffic has less than twenty (20) feet in which to pass or when vehicular traffic must pass to the left of the dividing islands in passing the site of the encroachment. The permittee may be required to remove excavated material from the site of the encroachment as it is excavated rather than stockpiling it on the street when such removal is necessary to permit traffic to pass freely and safely.

Sec. 7-1.303 Temporary Street Closure.
When the temporary closure of a public street to pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic is requested by the permittee, the permit shall be applied for at least two (2) weeks in advance of the date of requested closure. The Director of Public Works shall determine the effect of the requested closure and, if satisfied as to adequate, available and alternate detour routes, may issue a permit, attaching such conditions as he may deem necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the public and for the protection of the City. When emergency situations arise due to unforeseen circumstances or other causes, the two (2) week period may be waived.

Sec. 7-1.304 Beginning of Work.
Before beginning any work which is or includes excavation, construction of concrete sidewalks, curbs, gutters or driveway approaches, planting, trimming or removing trees, making, placing or causing an obstruction in a water course or traveled way, the permittee shall notify the Director of Public Works.

Sec. 7-1.305 Care of Drainage.
If the work, use or encroachment authorized in the permit shall interfere with the established drainage, the permittee shall provide for proper drainage as directed by the Director of Public Works.

Sec. 7-1.306 Maintenance of Encroachments.
After completion of all work, the permittee shall exercise reasonable care in inspecting and maintaining the area affected by the encroachment. For a period of one year, after the completion of the work, the permittee shall repair and make good any injury or damage to any portion of the street which occurs as the result of work done under the permit, including any and all injury or damage to the street which would not have occurred had such work not been done. By the acceptance of the permit, the permittee shall agree to comply with such requirements. The permittee shall, upon notice from the Director of Public Works, immediately repair any injury, damage or nuisance, in any portion of the right of way or water course resulting from the work done under the permit. In the event the permittee shall fail to act promptly, or should the exigencies of the injury or damage require repairs or replacement to be made before the permittee can be notified or can respond to the notifications, the City may, at its option, make the necessary repairs or replacement or perform the necessary work, and the permittee shall be charged with all the expenses incurred in the performance of the work.

Sec. 7-1.307 Relocation or Removal of Encroachments.
When any authorized encroachment is found to be in conflict with existing or proposed facilities or improvements owned, maintained or operated by the City, such encroachment shall, upon written demand of the Director of Public Works, be altered, relocated, shored up, supported, protected or removed in such a way as to eliminate the conflict, such work to be at the sole expense of the permittee. Should the permittee fail to comply with such written demand within a reasonable period of time, the City may cause such relocation of the encroachment at the expense of the permittee; provided, however, the provisions of this section shall become inoperative when any right of way shall become a freeway and thus cease to be used for the usual street purposes; and provided, further, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any public utility possessing a franchise from the City which franchise, either by express provision or by statute, imposes a relocation obligation upon such public utility.

Sec. 7-1.308 Standards and Specifications.
The Director of Public Works shall establish such standards and specifications as he may deem necessary for the proper construction, use and maintenance of encroachments. Any work or use done under such permit issued under the provisions of this Chapter shall conform to such standards and specifications.

Sec. 7-1.309 Storage of Materials.
Unless otherwise approved by the Director of Public Works, no material shall be stored within the traveled way or on any sidewalk so as to impair the free, safe and orderly movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Excess earth materials from trenching or other operations shall be removed from the pavement, traveled way or shoulder as the trench is backfilled or other work is carried forward.

Sec. 7-1.310 Poles and Transmission Line Carriers.
Clearances and types in the construction of poles and transmission line carriers shall be in accordance with rules, regulations and orders of the Public Utilities Commission and other public agencies having jurisdiction.

No guy wires shall be attached to trees without specific authorization to do so in the permit, and in no event shall guy wires be so attached as to girdle the tree or interfere with its growth. Guy wires shall not be below the minimum elevation above the ground prescribed in the rules, orders and regulations of the Public Utilities Commission.

When a pole, brace, stub or similar timber is removed and not replaced, the entire length thereof shall be removed from the ground, and the hole shall be backfilled and compacted. When such pole, brace, stub or similar timber was located in an area paved with concrete, asphalt or other permanent surfacing, the area occupied shall be trimmed and resurfaced in kind to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works.

The permittee shall remove and keep clear all vegetation on the right of way from within a radius of at least five (5) feet of poles when ordered by the Director of Public Works.

(5) If any part of the cash bond needs to be expended by the City to undertake work items outlined in Subsection (2), the associated grading permit is automatically terminated. The applicant shall submit a new grading permit application, a new grading plan with an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan acceptable to the City Engineer and provide the appropriate bonds and fees required by the City. There is no guarantee that a new permit will be issued.

(6) When all grading as shown in the approved grading plans has been completed, and all items of work in the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan have been installed to the satisfaction of the City, the applicant may request exoneration of grading and Erosion and Sediment Control Plan bonds. The City shall review all requests for exoneration of grading bonds, but Erosion and Sediment Control Plan bonds shall not be considered for exoneration until the site has weathered a storm season from October 15th to April 15th with Erosion and Sediment Control Plan elements in place. The City Engineer can, if requested, make a determination on minor grading projects, if the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan bonds need to be held through a storm season. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.314 Issuance or Denial of Permit.
(a) Issuance. Upon receiving an application for a grading permit, together with all of the things required by Sections 7-2.303 through 7-2.307, inclusive, the deposit of fees as required by Section 7-2.311, and the posting of a bond as required by Section 7-2.313, the City Engineer shall examine the application and things accompanying same, and, if satisfied that the application meets all requirements of this Chapter and of other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations, he shall issue the permit. The review of the application for a permit shall take into consideration, but shall not be limited to the following criteria:

(1) The grading is not excessive beyond that necessary for the permitted use of the site.

(2) The slopes can be effectively protected against erosion and slippage.

(3) The finished contours are relatively natural and do not distort the natural contours.

(4) Hillside sites are suitable for development in the manner proposed.

(5) The removal of natural vegetation is not excessive and that it is done in a manner which will minimize erosion. The permit shall be issued only to the owner or his agent. The permit shall be deposited securely in a conspicuous location of the site.

(b) Grounds for Denial.

(1) Hazardous Grading. The City Engineer shall not issue a permit in any case where he finds that the work as proposed by the applicant is liable to endanger any private property through grading or the removal of vegetation, or result in the deposition of debris on any public way or interfere with any existing drainage course or alter water quality. If it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the hazard can be essentially eliminated by the construction of retaining structures, buttress fills, or drainage devices, or by other means, the City Engineer may issue the permit with the condition that such work be performed.

(2) Geological or Flood Hazard. If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the land area for which grading is proposed is subject to geological or flood hazard to the extent that no reasonable amount of corrective work can eliminate or sufficiently reduce the hazard to human life or property, the grading permit shall be denied.

(3) Land Use. The City Engineer shall not issue a grading permit for work that will not comply with all provisions of Chapters 1 and 2 of Title 10 of this Code and any conditions imposed by the City Council on approval of the use.

(4) Existing Building Code or Zoning Ordinance Violations. The City Engineer shall not issue a grading permit if any building code or zoning ordinance violations exist on the site. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

If no limit is specified, the permittee shall complete the work within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the issuance of the grading permit. If the permittee is unable to complete the work within the specified time, he shall, prior to the expiration of the permit, present in writing to the City Engineer a request for an extension of time, setting forth the reasons for the requested extension. If, in the opinion of the City Engineer, such an extension is warranted, he may grant additional time for the completion of the work. Denial of an extension of time shall not preclude the right of the permittee to apply for a new permit for the remaining balance of the work. Written consent of the surety to any extension of time must be furnished before the approval of the extension becomes effective, unless the security consists of a cash deposit.

(d) Liability and Hold Harmless. Neither the issuance of a permit under the provisions of this Chapter, nor the compliance with the provisions thereof or with any conditions imposed in the permit issued hereunder, shall relieve any person from responsibility for damage to other persons or property nor impose any liability upon the City for damage to other persons or property. The permittee shall execute a hold harmless clause on the permit which shall read as follows:

The permittee, for himself, his contractors, and employees, agrees to save, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the City of Hercules and its officers, employees, and agents from all liabilities and claims for damages by reason of injury or death to any person or persons or damage to property from any cause whatsoever while in, upon, or in any way connected with the work covered by this grading permit.

Article 6. Design Standards and Grading Regulations.

Sec. 7-2.601 General Intent.
It is the general intent of the regulations of this Article that site development design shall preserve to the extent that is reasonable and feasible the existing natural scenic value of hills and valleys and contours of land. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.602 Criteria for Design.
All site development work, whether or not a permit is required under this Chapter, shall be designed to:

(a) Retain trees and other native vegetation which stabilizes steep hillsides, retains moisture, prevents erosion, and enhances the natural scenic beauty, insofar as practical.

(b) Place building pads in such a manner as to permit ample room for adequate landscaping and drainage between and around the buildings.

(c) Minimize scars from cuts and fills and avoid permanent scarring of the hillsides.

(d) Round off, in a natural manner, sharp angles at the top and toe of cut and fill slopes, and conform to existing terrain, both with respect to building sites and to road cross sections.

(e) Limit development on steep or dangerous terrain.

(f) Take into consideration geologic hazards and adverse soil conditions and their effect on the future stability of the development. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.603 Regulations for Excavations.
(a) Maximum Slope. Cuts shall not be steeper in slope than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical unless the owner furnishes a soil or a geological report certifying that the site has been investigated and indicating that the proposed deviation will not endanger any public or private property or result in the deposition of debris on any public way or place or interfere with any existing drainage course.

The City Engineer may require the excavation to be made with a cut face flatter in slope than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical if he finds it necessary for stability and safety.

(b) Drainage Terraces. Cut slopes exceeding forty (40) feet in vertical height shall have drainage terraces not less than eight (8) feet in width, measured from the outer edge of the terrace to the invert of the drain, at vertical intervals not to exceed twenty-five (25) feet except that where only one (1) such terrace is required it shall be located at mid-height. For cut slopes exceeding one hundred (100) feet in vertical height, the drainage terrace near mid-height shall be not less than twelve (12) feet in width. Design and construction of drainage terraces shall conform to the requirements of Section 7-2.606. All cut slopes shall be examined for evidence of seepage at completion of grading to determine if installation of horizontal drains is necessary.

(c) Variations. Variations from the regulations in this Section may be allowed by the City Engineer if they will provide equivalent safety, stability, and protection against erosion, as recommended by a soil engineer or engineering geologist. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.604 Regulations for Fills.
(a) Compaction. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (b) of this Section, all fills shall be compacted throughout their full extent to a minimum of ninety percent (90%) of maximum density as determined by the current ASTM D1557 test method. Field density shall be determined by a method acceptable to the City Engineer. All existing on-site fills and backfills shall be excavated and stockpiled for reuse in planned fill areas.

(b) Exceptions to Compaction Requirement.

(1) Special Compaction. Compaction may be reduced to eighty-five percent (85%) of maximum density as determined by the specified test in Subsection (a) of this Section, within the outer eight (8) inches of fill slope surfaces when such compaction is provided by grid rolling or equivalent means.

(2) Non-Structural Fills. Fills not intended to support structures, subdivision streets or improvements need not be compacted to the standard set forth in Subsection (a) of this Section if the City Engineer determines that such compaction is unnecessary as a safety measure. In making this determination, the City Engineer may require that an investigation be made by an approved soil testing agency to establish the characteristics of the soil, the amount of settlement to be expected and the susceptibility of the soil to erosion or slippage.

(3) Planted Slopes. Slope surfaces may be prepared for planting by scarifying, by the addition of topsoil, or by other methods, if such loose material does not exceed a depth of three inches and said slopes otherwise comply with the requirements of this Section.

(c) Preparation of Ground. The natural ground surface shall be pared to receive fill by removing vegetation, non-complying fill, topsoil, and, where slopes are five (5) horizontal to one (1) vertical or steeper, by benching into sound bedrock or other competent material. Five (5) feet of the lowermost bench shall be exposed beyond the toe of the fill. The bench shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a paved drain shall be provided.

(d) Fill Slope. No compacted fill shall be made which creates an exposed surface steeper in slope than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical. The City Engineer may require that the fill be constructed with an exposed surface flatter than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical if he finds this necessary for stability and safety.

(e) Fill Material. No organic or other reducible material shall be incorporated in fills. Except as recommended by the soil engineer and approved by the City Engineer, no rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than four (4) inches shall be buried or placed within forty-eight (48) inches of finish grade. No expansive adobe soils shall be used in fills within five (5) feet of finish grade in street and building areas and shall not be placed in the slope area of high fills.

(f) Drainage Terraces. Fill slopes exceeding thirty (30) feet in vertical height shall have drainage terraces not less than eight (8) feet in width, measured from the outer edge of the terrace to the invert of the drain, at vertical intervals not exceeding twenty-five (25) feet except that where only one (1) such terrace is required it shall be located at mid-height. For fill slopes exceeding one hundred (100) feet in vertical height, the drainage terrace near mid-height shall be not less than twelve (12) feet in width. Design and construction of drainage terraces shall conform to the requirements of Section 7-2.606.

(g) Slopes to Receive Fill. Where fill is to be placed above the top of an existing or proposed cut or natural slope steeper than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical, the toe of the fill shall be set back from the top edge of the slope a minimum distance of six (6) feet, measured horizontally, or such other distance as may be specifically recommended by a soil engineer or engineering geologist and approved by the City Engineer. Fills shall not toe out on slopes steeper than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.605 Slope Location and Setbacks.
(a) The property line of any proposed or existing site or parcel located within the grading project shall be located at the top of the slope or along any slope drainage terrace.

(b) Excavation and fill slopes shall be set back a minimum of three (3) feet plus one-fifth (1/5) the vertical height of the slope from the project boundary line, with a maximum of ten (10) feet.

(c) Buildings and structures shall be set back from excavation or fill slopes a minimum of four (4) feet plus one-fifth (1/5) of the vertical height of the slope, with a maximum of ten (10) feet.

Variations from the regulations in this Section may be allowed by the City Engineer if they will provide equivalent safety, stability, and protection against erosion, as recommended by a soil engineer or engineering geologist. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.606 Regulations for Drainage.
(a) General. Storm drainage structures, systems and facilities shall be provided as required by the City Engineer and in accordance with standard specifications on file in the Public Works Department. In addition, storm drain structures, systems and facilities shall be in compliance with State and Federal National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements. In satisfaction of these requirements, the City Engineer may require the installation of grease traps, sediment basins, storm water monitoring stations and such other devices and systems which the City Engineer determines are necessary for compliance with NPDES requirements. The design of all storm drainage, structures, systems and facilities shall be in accordance with recognized principles of hydraulics.

(b) Disposal. All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain, or natural watercourses, approved by the City Engineer as a safe place to discharge such waters. If the drainage device discharges onto natural ground, rip-rap or a similar energy dissipater may be required. City standard curbs and gutters shall also be installed at the property line adjoining the public right-of-way for the purpose of conveying site run-off to storm drain facilities.

(c) Site Drainage. Graded building sites (building pads) shall have a minimum slope of one percent (1%) towards a public street or drainage facility approved to receive storm waters. A lesser slope may be approved by the City Engineer for sites graded in relatively flat terrain, or where special drainage provisions are made, when he finds such modification will not result in unfavorable drainage conditions.

(d) Terrace Drains.

(1) All unlined swales or ditches on drainage terraces shall have a uniform longitudinal grade of not less than one percent (1%) nor more than three percent (3%) and a minimum depth of one (1) foot at the deepest part. Such terraces shall drain into a paved gutter, pipe or approved watercourse adequate to convey the water to a safe disposal area.

(2) The soil engineer may approve steeper slopes based on sediment transport analysis.

(3) The drainage terrace shall be provided with a lined ditch, if required by the soil engineer for stability or prevention of erosion.

(e) Overflow Protection. Berms, swales or other devices shall be provided at the top of cut or fill slopes to prevent surface water from flowing over or onto, and damaging the face of the slope. Special drainage provisions shall be made where a building or structure exists within five (5) feet of the top of a slope.

(f) Maintenance of Drainage. The permittee and/or owner shall maintain drainage facilities, in conformance with the requirements of this Chapter, during and after construction.

(g) Subdrains. Subdrains and laterals shall be as determined by the soil engineer. Subdrain designs shall be approved by the City Engineer. Provisions shall be made for carrying off all collected water to suitable disposal points removed from all slopes.

(h) Variations. Variations from the regulations of this Section may be allowed by the City Engineer if they will provide equivalent safety, stability, and protection against erosion and storm water pollution as recommended by a soils engineer or engineering geologist and by the County Flood Control District. (Ord. 308 Div. 1, 1992: Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.607 Erosion Control Planting.
(a) The surface of all erodible cut slopes more than five (5) feet in height and fill slopes more than three (3) feet in height shall be protected against erosion by planting with landscape materials as prescribed in Section 7-2.307. The plants and planting methods shall be suitable for the soil and climatic conditions of the site and in accordance with standard specifications on file in the Public Works Department.

(b) Irrigation System. Planted slopes shall be provided with an approved system of irrigation. A functional test of the system may be required. For slopes less than twenty (20) feet in vertical height hose bibs may be allowed where a hose no longer than fifty (50) feet is necessary for irrigation.

The requirements for permanent irrigation systems may be modified, when approved by the Director of Public Works, because the type of plants selected, planting methods used, and soil and climatic conditions at the site make irrigation of the slope planting unnecessary.

(c) Approval. The planting and irrigation system shall be installed after rough grading. Final approval of the work and release of the bond shall be made when growth is established on the slopes.

(d) Variations. Variations from the regulations of this Section may be allowed by the Director of Public Works if they will provide equivalent safety, stability, and protection against erosion, as recommended by a soil engineer or engineering geologist. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.608 Other Regulations.
(a) Hours of Work.

(b) A report by the soil engineer including the recommended soil-bearing capacity, a statement as to the expansive qualities of the soil, summaries of field and laboratory tests, and his opinion as to the adequacy of the work completed and its conformity with plans and specifications. The location of such tests and the limits of the compacted fill shall also show by plans and cross-section the location of any subdrains, rock disposal areas and/or buttress fills in the work.

(c) An engineering geologist’s report based on the final contour map including specific approval of the grading as affected by geological factors. The report shall include a revised geologic map and cross-sections, with recommendations regarding the location of buildings or sewage disposal systems. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.611 Evaluation of Existing Fill.
The City Engineer may require the submission of a preliminary soil investigation report and/or engineering geological report before issuing a building permit for a structure to be placed on any fill or embankment constructed before the enactment of this Chapter, or excepted from the requirement for a grading permit, or on any other lot or parcel on which critically expansive soils, slide conditions, or other soils, or geologic hazards exist or may reasonably be anticipated to exist. If the City Engineer determines that the action recommended in this report is likely to prevent structural damage to the proposed structure, he shall approve the report and the recommended action contained in the report shall become a part of the required construction as a condition of the permit. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

Sec. 7-2.612 Site Evaluation and Investigation.
(a) The City Engineer may conduct a field investigation and site evaluation of a lot or parcel prior to application for a grading and/or building permit if the owner submits a written request and the fee required by Section 7-2.311.

Sec. 7-2.701 Appeal to Council.
(a) Any applicant or any permittee or his surety, if any, excepting to any condition imposed upon his grading permit, or to any denial thereof, or to the revocation or suspension thereof, may appeal in writing to the City Council by filing with the City Clerk a written notice of such appeal setting forth the specific grounds thereof.

(b) Such notice must be filed within fourteen (14) days after notice of the action appealed from. The City Clerk shall thereupon set said matter for hearing before the Council and shall give written notice thereof separately to the appellant and his surety, if any. Said notice shall be given at least five (5) days before the hearing, and it shall be served personally or by deposit in the United States mail in a sealed envelope, with postage fully prepaid, addressed to the permit holder and to his surety at the mailing address, or, if there is no mailing address, the business address, shown in the application or in the bond, as the case may be.

(c) At such hearing the appellant shall show cause why the action excepted to should not be approved. Such hearing may, by the Council, be continued from time to time, and its findings on the appeal shall be final and conclusive in the matter. (Ord. 242 Div. 2 (part), 1986)

(a) Except as used in subsection (d) of this Section, “person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

(b) “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, timeshare unit, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof; or any space intended for transient occupancy by a camper, house trailer, motor home or recreational vehicle.

(c) “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof, or any space in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

(d) “Transient” means any individual who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy of a specific room or space by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing providing for a longer period of occupancy of the room. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered.

(e) “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

(f) “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent of any type or character is an operator for the purposes of this Chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

(g) “Tax Administrator” means the city Finance Director or designee. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 1 (part), 1985)

Article 2. Tax Imposed

Sec. 8-7.201 Tax Imposed.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 447 § 1, 2001: Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 2, 1985)

Article 3. Exemptions

Sec. 8-7.301 Exemptions.
No tax shall be imposed upon:

(a) Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided in this Chapter;

(b) Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 3, 1985)

Article 4. Operator’s Requirements; Reporting

Sec. 8-7.401 Operator’s Duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this Chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this Chapter. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 4 (part), 1985)

Sec. 8-7.402 Registration.
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Chapter, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the Tax Administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

(1) The name of the operator;

(2) The address of the hotel;

(3) The date upon which the certificate was issued;

(4) This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting such tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of the city. The certificate does not constitute a permit. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 4 (part), 1985)

Sec. 8-7.403 Reporting and Remitting.
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this Chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 4 (part), 1985)

Article 5. Penalties; Procedures

Sec. 8-7.501 Penalties and Interest.

(b) Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.

(c) Fraud. If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this Chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section.

(d) Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this Chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. Interest shall be imposed on penalties from thirty (30) days after an operator is notified of a delinquency.

(e) Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this Section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid by this chapter. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 5 (part), 1985)

Sec. 8-7.502 Failure to Collect and Report Tax—Determination of Tax by Tax Administrator.
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this Chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this Chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this Chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may, within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in this Chapter to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this Chapter of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 8-7.503 of this Article. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 5 (part), 1985)

Sec. 8-7.503 Appeal.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in this Chapter for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 5 (part), 1985)

Sec. 8-7.504 Records.
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. Such records shall be maintained at the operator’s premises or shall be available for delivery to the Tax Administrator within one week after request. The records shall include at least the following:

Whenever the amount of the tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this Chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the Tax Administrator within three (3) years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator.

(b) An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

(c) A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this Section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

(d) No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this Section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 206 Div. 1 Art. 6, 1985)

The tax imposed by this Section shall be at the rate of six percent (6%) of the charges made for such services and shall be collected from the service user by the telecommunication services supplier or its billing agent. There is a rebuttable presumption that telecommunication services, which are billed to a billing or service address in the City, are used, in whole or in part, within the City’s boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this Section. There is also a rebuttable presumption that prepaid telecommunication services sold within the City are used, in whole or in part, within the City and are therefore subject to taxation under this Section. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax. As used in this Article, the term “charges” shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the telecommunication services.

(b) “Mobile telecommunications service” shall be sourced in accordance with the sourcing rules set forth in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Section 124). The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to telecommunication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this Chapter, sourcing rules for the taxation of other telecommunication services, including but not limited to post-paid telecommunication services, prepaid telecommunication services, VoIP, and private communication services; provided, that such rules are based upon custom and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize multi-jurisdictional taxation (e.g., Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement).

(d) As used in this Section, the term “telecommunication services” shall include, but is not limited to, charges for: connection, reconnection, termination, movement, or change of telecommunication services; late payment fees; detailed billing; central office and custom calling features (including but not limited to call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and three-way calling); voice mail and other messaging services; directory assistance; access and line charges; universal service charges; regulatory, administrative and other cost recovery charges and surcharges; local number portability charges; and text and instant messaging. “Telecommunication services” shall not include digital downloads that are not “ancillary telecommunication services,” such as music, ringtones, games, and similar digital products.

(e) To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of telecommunication services subject to tax under this Section, any service user, upon proof to the Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or city on such telecommunication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the City under this Section.

(f) The tax on telecommunication services imposed by this Section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month.

In the event that the CARE program is repealed or otherwise ceases to exist in a substantially similar form, the exemption granted under this subsection shall automatically terminate.

(b) As used in this Section, the term “charges” shall apply to all services, components and items that are: (1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric service; or (2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term “charges” shall include, but is not limited to, the following charges:

(1) Energy charges;

(d) The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may survey the electric service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of electric retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the City, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by State or Federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such electric service. The Tax Administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such electric service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: (1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric service; or (2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a) of this Section.

(e) As used in this Section, the term “using electricity” shall not include the mere receiving of such electricity by an electrical corporation or governmental agency at a point within the City for resale.

(f) The tax on electricity provided by self-production or by a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this Article shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in Section 8-8.204. All other taxes on charges for electricity imposed by this Section shall be collected from the service user by the electric service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month; or, at the option of the person required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user, which must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month; provided, that such person shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the Tax Administrator, may be applied against any subsequent remittance that becomes due. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.203 Gas Users Tax.
(a) There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person using gas in the City, which is transported and delivered through a pipeline or by mobile transport. The tax imposed by this Section shall be at the rate of six percent (6%) of the charges made for such gas, including all services related to the storage, transportation and delivery of such gas. The tax shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent, and shall apply to all uses of gas, including but not limited to heating, electricity generation, and the use of gas as a component of a manufactured product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax shall not apply to any person who qualifies, and has been accepted, for the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program pursuant to California Public Utilities Code Sections 327 and 739.1 et seq., and as it may be amended from time to time. In the event that the CARE program is repealed or otherwise ceases to exist in a substantially similar form, the exemption granted under this subsection shall automatically terminate.

(b) As used in this Section, the term “charges” shall apply to all services, components and items for gas service that are: (1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; or (2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term “charges” shall include, but is not limited to, the following charges:

(1) The commodity charges for purchased gas, or the cost of gas owned by the service user (including the actual costs attributed to drilling, production, lifting, storage, gathering, trunkline, pipeline, and other operating costs associated with the production and delivery of such gas), which is delivered through a gas pipeline distribution system;

(2) Gas transportation charges (including interstate charges to the extent not included in commodity charges);

(3) Storage charges; provided, however, that the service supplier shall not be required to apply the tax to any charges for gas storage services when the service supplier cannot, as a practical matter, determine the jurisdiction where such stored gas is ultimately used; but it shall be the obligation of the service user to self-collect the amount of tax not applied to any charge for gas storage by the service supplier and to remit the tax to the appropriate jurisdiction;

(4) Capacity or demand charges, late charges, service establishment or reestablishment charges, transition charges, customer charges, minimum charges, annual and monthly charges, and any other charges which are necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; and

(5) Charges, fees, or surcharges for gas services or programs which are mandated by the California Public Utilities Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whether or not such charges, fees, or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing.

(c) As used in this Section, the term “charges” shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the gas or services related to the delivery of such gas.

(d) The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may survey the gas service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of gas retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the City, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by State or Federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such gas service. The Tax Administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such gas service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: (1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; or (2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a) of this Section.

(e) There shall be excluded from the calculation of the tax imposed in this Chapter charges made for gas that is to be resold and delivered through a pipeline distribution system.

(f) The tax on gas provided by self-production or by a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this Article shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in Section 8-8.204. All other taxes on charges for gas imposed by this Article shall be collected from the service user by the gas service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator, on or before the twentieth day of the following month; or, at the option of the person required to collect and/or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user, which must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month; provided, that such person shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the Tax Administrator, may be applied against any subsequent remittance that becomes due. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.204 Collection of Tax from Service Users Receiving Direct Purchase of Gas or Electricity.
(a) Any service user subject to the tax imposed by Section 8-8.202 or by Section 8-8.203 of this Article, which produces gas or electricity for self-use; which receives gas or electricity, including any related supplemental services, directly from a non-utility service supplier not under the jurisdiction of this Article; or which, for any other reason, is not having the full tax collected and remitted by its service supplier, a non-utility service supplier, or its billing agent on the use of gas or electricity in the City, including any related supplemental services, shall report said fact to the Tax Administrator and shall remit the tax due directly to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days of such use, based on the charges for, or value of, such gas or electricity, or supplemental services, as provided in subsection (b) of this Section. In lieu of paying said actual tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days of such use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month, or upon the payment pattern of similar customers of the service supplier using similar amounts of gas or electricity; provided, that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the Tax Administrator in writing, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due.

(b) The Tax Administrator may require said service user to identify its non-utility service supplier, and otherwise provide, subject to audit: invoices; books of account; or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, and the cost or price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such satisfactory evidence, or if the administrative cost of calculating the tax in the opinion of the Tax Administrator is excessive, the Tax Administrator may determine the tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used, including any related supplemental services, had been provided by the service supplier that is the primary supplier of gas or electricity within the City. Rate schedules for this purpose shall be available from the City. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.205 Water Users Tax.
(a) There is imposed a tax upon every person using water in the City which is transported and delivered through a pipeline distribution system. The tax imposed by this Section shall be at the rate of six percent (6%) of the charges made for such water.

(b) As used in this Section, the term “charges” shall apply to all services, components and items that are: (1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; or (2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for water service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. The term “charges” shall include, but is not limited to, the following charges: water commodity charges (potable and nonpotable); distribution or transmission charges; metering charges; customer charges; fire protection services; late charges; service establishment or reestablishment charges; franchise fees; franchise surcharges; annual and monthly charges; and other charges, fees and surcharges which are necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; and charges, fees, or surcharges for water services or programs, which are mandated by a water district or a State or Federal agency, whether or not such charges, fees, or surcharges appear on a bundled or line item basis on the customer billing.

(c) As used in this section, the term “charges” shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the water services.

(d) The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may survey the water service suppliers in the City to identify the various unbundled billing components of water retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the City, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by a water district or a State or Federal agency as a condition of providing such water service. The Tax Administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such water service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: (1) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; or (2) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for water service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (a) of this Section.

(e) There shall be excluded from the base on which the tax imposed in this Section is computed charges made for water which is to be resold and delivered through a pipeline distribution system; and charges made by a municipal water department, public utility or a city or municipal water district for water used and consumed by such department, public utility or water district in the conduct of the business of such department, utility or district.

(f) The tax on water service imposed by this Section shall be collected from the service user by the water service supplier or its billing agent.

(Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.206 Video Users Tax.
(a) There is hereby imposed a tax upon every person in the City using video services. The tax imposed by this Section shall be at the rate of six percent (6%) of the charges made for such services and shall be collected from the service user by the video service supplier or its billing agent. There is a rebuttable presumption that video services, which are billed to a billing or service address in the City, are used, in whole or in part, within the City’s boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this Chapter. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax.

(b) As used in this Section, the term “charges” shall include, but is not limited to, charges for the following:

(1) Regulatory fees and surcharges, franchise fees and public, educational and government access fees (PEG);

(4) Activation fees, reactivation fees, and reconnection fees;

(5) Video programming and video services;

(6) Ancillary video programming services (e.g., electronic program guide services, search functions, recording functions, or other interactive services or communications that are ancillary, necessary or common to the use or enjoyment of the video services);

(7) Equipment leases (e.g., remote, set box, recording and/or search devices, converters); and

(8) Service calls, service protection plans, name changes, changes of services, and special services.

(c) As used in this Section, the term “charges” shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the video services.

(d) The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to video service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this Chapter, an administrative ruling identifying those video services, or charges therefor, that are subject to or not subject to the tax of subsection (a) of this Section.

(e) The tax imposed by this Section shall be collected from the service user by the video service supplier, its billing agent, or a reseller of such services. In the case of video service, the service user shall be deemed to be the purchaser of the bulk video service (e.g., an apartment owner), unless such service is resold to individual users, in which case the service user shall be the ultimate purchaser of the video service. The amount of tax collected in one (1) month shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator, and must be received by the Tax Administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Article 3. Procedures

Sec. 8-8.301 Constitutional, Statutory, and Other Exemptions.
(a) Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as imposing a tax upon any person or service when the imposition of such tax upon such person or service would be in violation of a Federal or State statute, the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State.

(b) Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this Chapter pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section shall file an application with the Tax Administrator for an exemption; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a State or Federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name for such service. Said application shall be made upon a form approved by the Tax Administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption, and shall include the names of all service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed exempt by the Tax Administrator, such service user shall give the Tax Administrator timely written notice of any change in service suppliers so that the Tax Administrator can properly notify the new service supplier of the service user’s tax exempt status. A service user that fails to comply with this Chapter shall not be entitled to a refund of a users tax collected and remitted to the Tax Administrator from such service user as a result of such noncompliance.

The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 8-8.313. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager, or designee, pursuant to Section 8-8.313 is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

(c) The City Council may, by resolution, establish one (1) or more classes of persons or one (1) or more classes of utility service otherwise subject to payment of a tax imposed by this Chapter and provide that such classes of persons or service shall be exempt, in whole or in part, from such tax for a specified period of time. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.302 Bundling Taxable Items.
If any nontaxable charges are combined with and not separately stated from taxable service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge that are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier’s books and records kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. If the service supplier offers a combination of taxable and nontaxable services, and the charges are separately stated, then for taxation purposes, the values assigned the taxable and nontaxable services shall be based on its books and records kept in the regular course of business and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper valuation and apportionment of taxable and nontaxable charges. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.303 Substantial Nexus/Minimum Contact.
For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this Chapter, “substantial nexus,” “substantial economic presence,” and “minimum contacts” shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by State and Federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. Any telecommunication service (including VoIP) used by a person with a service address in the City, which service is capable of terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that “substantial nexus/minimum contacts” exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax, under this Article. A service supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the City for tax collection and remittance purposes if its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains or has within the City, directly or through an agent, affiliate or subsidiary, a place of business of any nature; solicits business in the City by employees, independent contractors, resellers, agents, affiliates or other representatives; solicits business in the City on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter with the City or distributed from a location with the City; or advertises in newspapers or other periodicals printed and published within the City or through materials distributed in the City by means other than the United States mail; or if there are activities performed in the City on behalf of the service supplier that are significantly associated with the service supplier’s ability to establish and maintain a market in the City for the provision of utility services that are subject to a tax under this Chapter (e.g., an affiliated person engaging in activities in the City that inure to the benefit of the service supplier in its development or maintenance of a market for its services in the City). (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.304 Duty to Collect Procedures.
(a) Collection by Service Suppliers. The duty of service suppliers to collect and remit the taxes imposed by the provisions of this Chapter shall be performed as follows:

(1) The tax shall be collected by service suppliers insofar as practicable at the same time as, and along with, the collection of the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which was accrued for the billing period, a proportionate share of both the charge and the tax shall be deemed to have been paid. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said charges, Section 8-8.307 shall apply.

(2) The duty of a service supplier to collect the tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this Chapter. Where a service user receives more than one (1) billing, one (1) or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing period.

(b) Filing Return and Payment. Each person required by this Chapter to remit a tax shall file a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms approved by the Tax Administrator, on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax collected shall be included with the return and filed with the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he or she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this Article. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information that is exempt from the disclosure provisions of the Public Records Act. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004. Formerly 8-8.304, 8-8.305)

Sec. 8-8.306 Collection Penalties—Service Suppliers.
(a) Taxes collected from a service user are delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the Tax Administrator on the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this Article shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the City’s account on the following business day.

(b) If the person required to collect and/or remit the utility users tax fails to collect the tax (by failing to properly assess the tax on one (1) or more services or charges on the customer’s billing) or fails to remit the tax collected on or before the due date, the Tax Administrator shall attach a penalty for such delinquencies or deficiencies at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is delinquent or deficient in the remittance, and shall pay interest at the rate of seventy-five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid.

(c) The Tax Administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the Tax Administrator.

(d) For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this Chapter shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Administrator may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates of this Article to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by other public agencies imposing a utility users tax, or otherwise legally established, to create a central payment location or mechanism. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.307 Deficiency Determination and Assessment—Tax Application Errors.
(a) The Tax Administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person required to pay or collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter has failed to pay, collect, and/or remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one (1) or more taxable services or charges. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this Section if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.

(b) The Tax Administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate of seventy-five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the City. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the matter.

(c) If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the City. If the person requests a hearing, the Tax Administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the Tax Administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the Tax Administrator desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced.

(d) At the time fixed for the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the Tax Administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tax Administrator shall issue a final assessment (or nonassessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person owing the tax. The decision of the Tax Administrator may be appealed pursuant to Section 8-8.313. Filing an application with the Tax Administrator and appeal to the City Manager, or designee, pursuant to Section 8-8.313 is a prerequisite to a suit thereon.

(e) Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the Tax Administrator on or before the thirtieth day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be fifteen percent (15%) on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate of seventy-five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the City seeking payment of a tax assessed under this Article shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection (e).

(f) All notices under this Article may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.308 Administrative Remedy—Nonpaying Service Users.
(a) Whenever the Tax Administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the Tax Administrator deems it in the best interest of the City, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this Article from certain named service users for specific billing periods. To the extent the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two (2) or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the City with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this Chapter. Nothing herein shall require that the Tax Administrator institute proceedings under this Section if, in the opinion of the Tax Administrator, the cost of collection or enforcement likely outweighs the tax benefit.

(b) In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate of seventy-five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, or any fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid.

(c) The Tax Administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the Tax Administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.

(d) If the service user fails to remit the tax to the Tax Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the service of the notice upon him or her, the Tax Administrator may impose an additional penalty of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the total tax that is owed. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.309 Actions to Collect.
Any tax required to be paid by a service user under the provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the service user to the City. Any such tax collected from a service user which has not been remitted to the Tax Administrator shall be deemed a debt owed to the City by the person required to collect and remit and shall no longer be a debt of the service user. Any person owing money to the City under the provisions of this Chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount, including penalties and interest as provided for in this Chapter, along with any collection costs incurred by the City as a result of the person’s noncompliance with this Chapter, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees. Any tax required to be collected by a service supplier or owed by a service user is an unsecured priority excise tax obligation under 11 U.S.C. Section 507(a)(8)(C). Service suppliers who seek to collect charges for service in bankruptcy proceedings shall also include in any such claim the amount of taxes due the City for those services, unless the Tax Administrator determines that such duty is in conflict with any Federal or State law, rule, or regulation or that such action would be administratively impractical. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004)

Sec. 8-8.310 Additional Powers and Duties of the Tax Administrator.
(a) The Tax Administrator shall have the power and duty, and is hereby directed, to enforce each and all of the provisions of this Article.

(b) The Tax Administrator may adopt administrative rules and regulations consistent with provisions of this Article for the purpose of interpreting, clarifying, carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes herein imposed. The administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this Article, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by California Government Code Section 53750(h)(2). A copy of such administrative rules and regulations shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office. To the extent that the Tax Administrator determines that the tax imposed under this Article shall not be collected in full for any period of time from any particular service supplier or service user, that determination shall be considered an exercise of the Tax Administrator’s discretion to settle disputes and shall not constitute a change in taxing methodology for purposes of Government Code Section 53750 or otherwise. The Tax Administrator is not authorized to amend the City’s methodology for purposes of Government Code Section 53750 and the City does not waive or abrogate its ability to impose the utility users tax in full as a result of promulgating administrative rulings or entering into agreements.

(c) Upon a proper showing of good cause, the Tax Administrator may make administrative agreements, with appropriate conditions, to vary from the strict requirements of this Article and thereby: (1) conform to the billing procedures of a particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in the collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this Article; or (2) to avoid a hardship where the administrative costs of collection and remittance greatly outweigh the tax benefit. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the Tax Administrator’s office, and is voidable by the Tax Administrator or the City at any time.

(d) The Tax Administrator may conduct an audit, to ensure proper compliance with the requirements of this Article, of any person required to collect and/or remit a tax pursuant to this Article. The Tax Administrator shall notify said person of the initiation of an audit in writing. In the absence of fraud or other intentional misconduct, the audit period of review shall not exceed a period of three (3) years next preceding the date of receipt of the written notice by said person from the Tax Administrator. Upon completion of the audit, the Tax Administrator may make a deficiency determination pursuant to Section 8-8.307 for all taxes (and applicable penalties and interest) owed and not paid, as evidenced by information provided by such person to the Tax Administrator. If said person is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient records to enable the Tax Administrator to verify compliance with this Article, the Tax Administrator is authorized to make a reasonable estimate of the deficiency. Said reasonable estimate shall be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of correctness.

(e) Upon receipt of a written request of a taxpayer, and for good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing any statement required pursuant to this Article for a period of not to exceed forty-five (45) days; provided, that the time for filing the required statement has not already passed when the request is received. No penalty for delinquent payment shall accrue by reason of such extension. Interest shall accrue during said extension at the rate of seventy-five one-hundredths percent (0.75%) per month, prorated for any portion thereof.

The Tax Administrator may also participate with other utility users tax public agencies in conducting coordinated compliance reviews with the goal of achieving administrative efficiency and uniform tax application determinations, where possible. To encourage full disclosure and ongoing cooperation on annual compliance reviews, the Tax Administrator, and its agents, may enter into agreements with the tax collecting service providers and grant prospective-only effect on any changes regarding the taxation of services or charges that were previously deemed by the service provider, in good faith and without gross negligence, to be nontaxable.

Sec. 8-8.317 No Increase in Tax Percentage or Change in Methodology without Voter Approval—Amendment or Repeal.
This Chapter may be repealed or amended by the City Council without a vote of the people. However, as required by Article XIII C of the California Constitution, voter approval is required for any amendment provision that would increase the rate of any tax levied pursuant to this Chapter. The people of the City of Hercules affirm that the following actions shall not constitute an increase of the rate of a tax:

(a) The restoration of the rate of the tax to a rate that is no higher than that set by this Chapter, if the City Council has acted to reduce the rate of the tax;

(b) An action that interprets or clarifies the methodology of the tax, or any definition applicable to the tax, so long as such interpretation or clarification (even if contrary to some prior interpretation or clarification) is not inconsistent with the language of this Chapter;

(c) The establishment of a class of persons that is exempt or excepted from the tax or the discontinuation of any such exemption or exception (other than the discontinuation of an exemption or exception specifically set forth in this Chapter); and

(d) The collection of the tax imposed by this Chapter, even if the City had, for some period of time, failed to collect the tax. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013)

Sec. 8-8.318 Sunset.
This Chapter shall automatically sunset, and its provisions shall become ineffective, on January 1, 2025. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004. Formerly 8-8.320)

Sec. 8-8.319 Interaction with Prior Tax.
(a) Collection of Tax by Service Providers. Service providers shall begin to collect the tax imposed by this amended Chapter as soon as feasible after the effective date of this Chapter as amended, but in no event later than permitted by Section 799 of the California Public Utilities Code.

(b) Satisfaction of Tax Obligation by Service Users. Prior to September 1, 2013, any person who pays the tax levied pursuant to this Chapter, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, with respect to any charge for a service shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligation to pay the tax levied pursuant to this Chapter as amended herein, with respect to that charge. The intent of this subsection is to prevent the imposition of multiple taxes upon a single utility charge during the transition period from the prior utility users tax ordinance to the amended utility users tax ordinance (which transition period ends September 1, 2013) and to permit service providers or other persons with an obligation to remit the tax hereunder, during that transition period, to satisfy their collection obligations by collecting either tax.

(c) In the event that a final court order should determine that the election enacting this Chapter (as amended herein) is invalid for whatever reason, or that any tax imposed under this Chapter (as amended herein) is invalid in whole or in part, then the taxes imposed under this Chapter, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, shall automatically continue to apply with respect to any service for which the tax levied pursuant to this Chapter has been determined to be invalid. Such automatic continuation shall be effective beginning as of the first date of service (or billing date) for which the tax imposed by this Chapter is not valid. However, in the event of an invalidation, any tax (other than a tax that is ordered refunded by the court or is otherwise refunded by the City) paid by a person with respect to a service and calculated pursuant to this Chapter (as amended herein) shall be deemed to satisfy the tax imposed under this Section, as it existed prior to its amendment as provided herein, on that service, so long as the tax is paid with respect to a service provided no later than six months subsequent to the date on which the final court order is published. (Ord. 475 § 1 (part), 2013: Ord. 395 § 1 (part), 2004. Formerly 8-8.321)

Sec. 9-2.10 Universal Design.
(a) Purpose and Intent.

The intent is not to mandate the features, but rather to mandate per state law that the features be offered. This will allow home buyers to purchase features that either makes the dwelling unit more accessible immediately or that provides elements for features to be installed at a future date.

(b) Findings. Assembly Bill 1400 was approved by the Governor on October 1, 2003. It provides that Section 17959.6 be added to the California Health and Safety Code requiring local jurisdictions to develop an ordinance that requires developers to offer accessibility features in single-family dwellings. Any additional costs for accessibility features selected are to be absorbed by the buyer. Enactment of this Section will fulfill the mandate by the State of California.

This Chapter shall be inapplicable to:

(a) The financing or leasing of apartments, offices, stores or similar space within apartment buildings, industrial buildings, commercial buildings, mobile home parks or trailer parks;

(b) Mineral, oil or gas leases;

(c) Land dedicated for cemetery purposes under the Health and Safety Code of the State of California;

(e) A lot line adjustment between two (2) or more existing adjacent parcels, where the land taken from one (1) parcel is added to an adjacent parcel, and where a greater number of parcels than originally existed is not thereby created, provided the lot line adjustment is approved by the City Council. In order to secure City approval, a drawing in form and content acceptable to the City Engineer showing the lot line adjustments) shall be filed with the City Engineer.

(f) Boundary line or exchange agreements to which the State Lands Commission or a local agency holding a trust grant of tide or submerged lands is a party

(Ord. 187 §§ 1, 3, 1984: Ord. 178 § 1, 1983)

Sec. 10-2.103 Maps Required.
A tentative and final map shall be required for all subdivisions creating five (5) or more parcels, five (5) or more condominiums as defined in Civil Code Section 783, or a community apartment project containing five (5) or more parcels, except:

(a) Where real property before division contains less than five (5) acres, each parcel created by the division abuts upon a maintained public street or highway and no dedications or improvements are required by the City Council; or

(b) Where each parcel created by the division has a gross area of twenty (20) acres or more and has an approved access to a maintained public street or highway; or

(c) Any parcel or parcels of real property having approved access to a public street or highway which comprises part of a tract zoned for industrial or commercial development, and which has the approval of the City Council as to street alignments and widths; or

(d) Any parcel or parcels of real property divided into lots or parcels, each of a gross area of forty (40) acres or more.

A parcel map shall be required for minor subdivisions and for those subdivisions described in (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section.

Sec. 10-2.104 General Requirements for Subdivisions.
In all subdivisions consideration shall be given to provision for uniformity of street widths and for properly relating alignments and street names. Preservation of the privacy and safety of streets in residential areas shall be encouraged by the prevention of through traffic in such areas. The amount of street required shall be directly related to the traffic generating uses of abutting land. The number of intersections on major streets shall be reduced to a minimum consistent with the basic needs of ingress and egress. Intersections shall be so designed as to provide for the greatest safety both for pedestrians and motorists. Provisions shall be made for assuring adequate light, air and privacy on all parcels of property, regardless of the land use. The topography of the land shall be respected and streets shall be designed so as to prevent excessive grading and scarring of the landscape. Problems of drainage shall be resolved in such a manner as to permit the occupants of the subdivision reasonable security against flooding.

Sec. 10-2.105 Variations.
Whenever the real property involved in any subdivision is of such size or shape or is subject to such title limitations of record or is affected by such topographical location or conditions, or is to be devoted to such use that it is impossible, impractical or undesirable in a particular case for the subdivider fully to conform to the regulations contained in this Chapter, or a Planned Unit Development is proposed, variations from the requirements of this Chapter may be permitted by the City Council provided such variations are in conformity with the spirit and purpose of the Map Act and this Chapter.

Sec. 10-2.106 General Responsibilities of Director of Public Works.

Sec. 10-2.107 General Responsibilities of Director of Planning.
The Director of Planning shall be responsible for reporting to the City Council that the proposed subdivision and proposed improvements are consistent with the general and specific plans of the City, and in conformity with the zoning ordinance.

Sec. 10-2.108 Jurisdiction of Council.
The City Council has final jurisdiction in the approval of subdivision maps, the establishment of standards of design and improvements, and the acceptance of such lands and/or improvements as may be proposed for dedication as a result of the subdivision process.

Sec. 10-2.109 Referral to Affected Agencies.
Since the provision of some public facilities and utilities are vested in special districts and government boards, bureaus or agencies and utility companies, both public and private, hereinafter referred to as agencies, whose jurisdiction includes the city and contiguous surrounding area and whose services will be required in those areas which are subdivided under the regulations herein, all proposed subdivision maps shall be referred to affected agencies for their information, action, and written report as an integral part of the subdivision process. The Director of Planning shall coordinate the dissemination of information regarding a proposed subdivision, and the City Council in its approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the proposed subdivision shall consider the written reports of such agencies and shall take into account their requirements.

Sec. 10-2.110 Effect of Annexation.
(a) When any area in a subdivision as to which a final map has been finally approved by the board of supervisors and filed for record pursuant to the Map Act is thereafter annexed to the City, the final map and any agreement relating to such subdivision shall continue to govern such subdivision.

(b) When any area in a subdivision or proposed subdivision as to which a tentative map has been filed but a final map has not been finally approved, or as to which a parcel map is required by the Map Act or county ordinance but the final act required to make such parcel map effective has not been taken, is annexed to the City, all procedures and regulations of this Chapter shall be deemed to commence as of the effective date of the annexation and the map shall comply with all requirements of applicable ordinances of the City.

Sec. 10-2.111 Title.
This Chapter shall be known as the Hercules Subdivision Ordinance.

Sec. 10-2.112 Advisory Agency.
For the purposes of this Chapter the Planning Commission shall be the Advisory Agency, but its authority as the Advisory Agency shall be limited to review of tentative and parcel maps, holding public hearings thereon and making recommendations to the City Council. (Ord. 175 § 2 (part), 1983)

Chapter 7. Flood Damage Prevention
Article 1. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods

Sec. 10-7.101 Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Hercules of Contra Costa County does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009)

Sec. 10-7.102 Findings of Fact.
The flood hazard areas of the City of Hercules are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009)

Sec. 10-7.103 Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:

(a) Protect human life and health; and

(b) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; and

(c) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; and

(d) Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and

(e) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; and

(f) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; and

(g) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

(h) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and

(i) To establish regulations for construction or development in areas of special flood hazard as mandated by the federal government in order to continue the eligibility of properties in the City of Hercules for flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009: Ord. 279 Div. I (part), 1989. Formerly 10-7.101)

Sec. 10-7.104 Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes regulations to:

(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; and

(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; and

(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; and

(d) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009)

(a) A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and

(b) The condition resulting from flood-related erosion.

“Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

“Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

“Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either side of the “regulatory floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.

“Fraud and victimization,” as related to Article 6 of this Chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City of Hercules will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

Sec. 10-7.402 Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator.
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(a) Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:

(1) Permit requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; and

(2) All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; and

(3) The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and

(4) The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Hercules, Contra Costa County; and

(5) All Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

(b) Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures.

(1) Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions about Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining “market value.”

(2) Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

(c) Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 10-7.302, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article 5 of this Chapter.

NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one (1) of two (2) methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas—A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations,” dated July 1995.

(d) Notification of Other Agencies.

(1) Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse.

A. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; and

B. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and

C. Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.

(2) Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations.

A. Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).

B. All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.

Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

(3) Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.

(e) Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

Sec. 10-7.506 Floodways.
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(a) Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1—30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City of Hercules, Contra Costa County.

(b) Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Hercules, Contra Costa County, shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(c) If Sections 10-7.501(a) and (b) and 10-7.602(a) and (b) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 5 of this chapter. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009: Ord. 279 Div. 1 (part), 1989. Formerly 10-7.405)

Sec. 10-7.507 Coastal High Hazard Areas.
Within coastal high hazard areas, Zones V, V1—30, and VE, as established under Section 10-7.302, the following standards shall apply:

(a) All new residential and nonresidential construction, including substantial improvement/damage, shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards.

(b) All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide.

(c) All new construction and substantial improvement shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls as defined in Article 2 of this Chapter. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.

(d) Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings.

(e) Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

(f) The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records:

(1) Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection (a) of this Section; and

(2) The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009: Ord. 279 Div. 1 (part), 1989. Formerly 10-7.406)

Article 6. Appeals and Variance Procedure

Sec. 10-7.601 Nature of Variances.
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.

The variance criteria set forth in this Section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this Chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the City of Hercules City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this Chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009)

Sec. 10-7.602 Conditions for Variances.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level; providing that the procedures of Articles 4 and 5 of this Chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Article 2 of this Chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(c) Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this Chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City of Hercules City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City of Hercules City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:

(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and

(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Contra Costa Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

(f) The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009: Ord. 279 Div. 1 (part), 1989. Formerly 10-7.502)

Sec. 10-7.603 Appeal Board.
(a) In passing upon requests for variances, the City of Hercules City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this Chapter, and the:

(1) Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; and

(2) Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; and

(3) Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; and

(4) Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; and

(5) Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; and

(6) Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; and

(7) Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; and

(8) Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; and

(9) Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; and

(10) Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

(11) Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

(b) Variances shall only be issued upon a:

(1) Showing of good and sufficient cause; and

(2) Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

(3) Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud and victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(c) Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections (a) through (d) of this Section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and do not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

(d) Upon consideration of the factors of Section 10-7.602(a) and the purposes of this Chapter, the City of Hercules City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter. (Ord. 449 § 1 (part), 2009: Ord. 279 Div. 1 (part), 1989. Formerly 10-7.501)

Chapter 15. Transportation Systems Management
Article 1. Findings

Sec. 10-15.101 Findings.
(a) Transportation systems management (hereinafter referred to as “TSM”) has the potential to reduce vehicle trips and vehicle emissions more efficiently and cost effectively than major roadway improvements.

(b) For many years prior to the passage of Contra Costa County Measure C in 1988, local jurisdictions developed and implemented a variety of TSM and transportation demand management (hereinafter referred to as “TDM”) projects and programs (e.g., operation of transit systems, construction of bicycle facilities, land use policy coordination and related improvements).

(c) Since 1992, the Contra Costa Transportation Authority has committed both Measure C and Transportation Fund for Clean Air (“TFCA”) funds to four subarea programs for the implementation of Measure C and Clean Air Plan goals.

(d) Pursuant to the provisions of Measure C, adoption of a TDM ordinance was deemed to be one component of a comprehensive transportation planning effort.

(e) In compliance with the requirements of the TDM ordinance, large employers were required to develop and implement trip reduction programs at work sites and, pursuant to those requirements, implementation of the TDM ordinance was delegated to the West Contra Costa Transportation Advisory Committee (“WCCTAC”).

(f) The Countywide Comprehensive Transportation Plan incorporates each regional committee’s action plan for routes of regional significance, which support specific TSM/TDM goals and objectives.

(g) Over the past four years, the sub-area TDM programs have been successful in reducing vehicle trips and emissions at the employment sites specified in the TDM ordinance, as well as in school and residential areas where programs have been implemented.

(h) Since the adoption of the TDM ordinance, TDM efforts have been expanded to include aspects of the transportation systems other than employer programs (e.g., enhancement of transit and bicycle facilities, incorporation of new technologies into the system, land use policy coordination and related enhancements).

(i) In adopting the ordinance codified in this Chapter, cooperation and coordination with other local jurisdictions and regions in furthering TSM are acknowledged as having the potential to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its efforts; and accordingly, the Council of the City of Hercules directs staff to take steps to implement TSM in accordance with the policies, goals, and objectives set forth herein, and in cooperation with WCCTAC staff. (Ord. 344 § 3 (part), 1998)

Article 2. Purpose, Goal and Objectives

Sec. 10-15.201 Purpose.
In light of legislation passed eliminating mandatory employer-based trip reduction requirements, the following purposes, goals, and objectives are adopted in order to assist staff in implementing this Chapter and TSM programs. The City establishes this TSM ordinance:

(a) To promote maximum efficiency in the existing transportation system and to further the transportation goals of the Measure C Growth Management Program, Contra Costa’s Congestion Management Program, the Bay Area Clean Air Plan, and the West County Action Plan, by:

(1) Promoting and encouraging the use of transit, ridesharing, bicycling, walking, flexible work hours, and telecommuting as alternatives to solo driving,

(2) Incorporating these goals and objectives into the land use and review and planning process,

(3) Developing proactive programs and/or projects either alone, in conjunction with other jurisdictions, or with WCCTAC, aimed at achieving these goals,

(4) Considering the incorporation of appropriate technology designed to facilitate traffic flow, provide transit and highway information, provide trip generation alternatives, and considering the incorporation of related technology into the transportation system,

(5) Cooperating with other jurisdictions, the private sector, and transit operators in planning and implementing transportation programs,

(6) Educating West County employees, employers, residents, and students regarding the benefits and availability of commute alternatives,

(7) Working with the transit authorities to better serve West Contra Costa County,

(8) Encouraging the most cost-effective transportation improvement projects aimed at achieving congestion relief, and

(9) Cooperating with other jurisdictions and agencies, the private sector, and transit operators in planning and implementing transportation programs;

(b) To reflect an ongoing commitment to expand TSM efforts beyond employer based trip reduction programs, in order to achieve congestion management and air quality goals; and

(c) To comply with applicable state and federal laws as well as with Measure C Growth Management Program requirements pertaining to TSM. (Ord. 344 § 3 (part), 1998)

Sec. 10-15.202 Goal.
The goal of this Chapter is to ensure the continuation of a proactive TSM program effort aimed at reducing vehicle trips, vehicle emissions, and traffic congestion in the most efficient and cost effective manner. (Ord. 344 § 3 (part), 1998)

Chapter 16. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
Sec. 10-16.101 Purpose and Legislative Intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Hercules’ authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. This Chapter provides for the safe and efficient integration of facilities necessary for the provision of advanced wireless telecommunications services throughout the community and to ensure the ready availability of reliable wireless services to the public, government agencies and first responders, with the intention of furthering the public safety and general welfare.

The City of Hercules finds that wireless telecommunications facilities (facilities) may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and environment of the City and its inhabitants. The City also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the City and of significant benefit to the City and its residents. In order to assure that the placement, construction or modification of a facility is consistent with the City’s land use policies, the City is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facility application and permitting process. The intent of this Chapter is to minimize the physical impact of wireless telecommunications facilities on the community, protect the character of the community to the extent reasonably possible, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the City of Hercules.

(b) A substantial modification or subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this Chapter any modification that would increase the height, width, profile, structural loading on the support structure beyond the definition of eligible facility; or increase the size of the compound beyond the maximum allowed under this Chapter; or does not conform with the concealment policy for towers and wireless facilities set forth in Section 10-16.108(z) (including but not limited to height, size of the profile, color and camouflage and the distance or size of extensions beyond the tower or other support structure). To protect and maintain the integrity and effect of the concealment policy, any lateral modifications that would extend more than ten (10) feet from the lateral extremity of a tower or the width of the tower at the height of attachment, or more than three (3) feet from the edge of a non-tower support structure would be subject to a special use permit; or

(c) A facility permitted after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this Chapter that involves construction or excavation or deployment outside the compound (i.e., outside the current boundaries of the site); or

(d) Proposes more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four (4) cabinets; or for towers in the public rights-of-way and base stations if the modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on or below the ground if there are no pre-existing ground or below ground cabinets associated with the structure; or that involves the installation of ground or below ground cabinets that are more than ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; or

(e) Facilities that do not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the original support structure and/or base station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not exceed the threshold for an eligible facility as defined in FCC Report and Order 14-153. (Ord. 487 § 3 (part), 2015)

Sec. 10-16.108 General Policies for All Applications under this Chapter.
In order to ensure that the placement, construction and modification of a facility does not endanger or jeopardize the health, safety, public welfare, environmental features, or change the nature and character of the community and neighborhood and other aspects of the quality of life specifically listed elsewhere in this Chapter, the City hereby adopts an overall policy and related procedures with respect to the submittal, review, approval and issuance of permits or administratively granted authority for wireless facilities for the express purpose of achieving these outcomes. The following general policy actions are intended to accomplish these goals:

General Application Process.

(a) Implementing an application process and requirements; establishing procedures for examining and analyzing the contents of an application and issuing a special use permit or administrative special use permit that is both fair and consistent with this Section.

(b) Promoting, and requiring wherever possible, the sharing and/or co-location of support structures among service providers.

(c) Requiring administrative special use permit for any modification of an eligible facility.

(d) Requiring a special use permit for any new tower or other support structure or any co-location or modification of a facility that is not an eligible facility pursuant to the FCC’s Report and Order 14-153 dated October 17, 2014.

(e) There shall be no towers or other support structures permitted or built on speculation, such meaning without a carrier or other wireless provider proving the need for such as required in this Section and committing in writing to attach to and provide service from the tower or other new structure immediately upon construction.

(f) No work of any kind on a facility shall be started until the application is reviewed and approved by the Commission or appropriate administrative entity and the special use permit, or administrative special use permit if applicable, has been issued and all other applicable permits have been issued.

(g) A facility or part thereof, including but not limited to ancillary structures or equipment, utilities installed to serve the facility and equipment used to construct or maintain the facility, shall not infringe on or in any manner whatsoever, at any time and for any reason other than for an official governmentally declared emergency, encumber, obstruct or interfere with the City’s property and/or public rights-of-way or the use thereof without the City’s express written permission.

(h) The Planning Department is the officially designated agency or body of the City to whom applications for an administrative special use permit or a special use permit for a facility must be made. The City at its discretion may hire an outside consultant to accept, review, analyze, evaluate and make recommendations to staff and present the findings to the Planning Department or Planning Commission (Commission) who is authorized to make decisions with respect to granting or not granting or revoking an administrative special use permit or special use permit applied for under this Chapter respectively. The Commission shall possess the right to appeal Planning Department decisions while the City Council shall possess the sole right to hear appeals on all special use permits following the procedure outlined in Chapter 44 of the City Zoning Ordinance.

(i) Pre-Application Meeting. There shall be a pre-application meeting for all intended applications. The pre-application meeting may be held either on site or telephonically as deemed appropriate. The purpose of the pre-application meeting will be to address (1) issues that will help to expedite the application review and permitting process; and (2) identify and address certain issues or concerns the City or the applicant may have.

(j) Site Visit. If there has not been a prior site visit for the requested facility within the previous six (6) months a site visit shall be conducted. Costs of the City’s consultant to prepare for and attend the pre-application meeting will be borne by the applicant and paid for out of a deposit fee set forth in the City’s Master Fee Schedule, which shall have been paid to the City prior to any site visit or pre-application meeting.

(k) An application may not be filed until both a site visit, when required, and a pre-application meeting are held, and any required applicable community outreach meeting has been conducted and a story pole has been erected as required, and all fees and deposits have been delivered to the City Planning Department.

(l) Applicant(s) of Record. The owner(s) of the property on which the facility is located or is proposed to be located and the owner(s) of the support structure to which antennas or related equipment currently are or are proposed to be attached to must be an official applicant(s) of record. Notwithstanding the preceding, for a new tower or other new support structure or for a substantial modification the technical need for a new facility must be documented and substantiated by clear and convincing technical evidence showing a particular carrier’s or other user of the facility’s technical need for what is requested. Notwithstanding the preceding, to avoid any conflict of interest as relates to City-owned facilities, the City is not permitted to be an applicant or a party to an application by a private commercial entity.

(m) The applicant must provide clear and convincing documentation to substantiate that it has the legal right to proceed as proposed on the site in the form of an executed copy of the lease with the landowner or a signed letter of agency granting authorization (which shall not constitute approval of proposed work). If the applicant owns the site, a copy of the ownership record is required.

(n) An application shall be signed on behalf of the applicant(s) by the person(s) vested with the authority to bind and commit the applicant and attesting to the truth, completeness and accuracy of the information presented.

(o) Owner Permission. An applicant intending to co-locate on an existing facility shall be required to provide written documentation of the intent of the existing facility owner and property owner to allow the intended use by the applicant.

(p) Properly Completed Application. All applicants shall closely follow the instructions for preparing an application. Not closely following the instructions without permission to deviate from such shall result in the application being deemed incomplete and a tolling of the otherwise required thirty (30) day notification period of an incomplete application until the receipt of a complete and properly completed application.

(q) Amended Application. Unless expressly and boldly stated in the front of the application at the time of its submittal that the application is not complete, it shall be assumed that the applicant reviewed the application for compliance and intended the application to be complete, and therefore any subsequently submitted information intended to correct any deficiencies shall be deemed an amendment to the application.

(r) Any and all representations made by the applicant or that are made in support of the application during the application process, whether written or oral, shall be deemed to be on the record and shall be deemed to have been intended to be relied upon in good faith by the City. Any oral representation shall be treated as if it were made in writing.

(s) Single Submittal. To establish a clear and specific date certain by which to measure the time allowed the City for the review for completeness of an application, as well as the date by which action must be taken, an application must be filed as a single submittal and not in separately subsequently provided submittals. No application shall be allowed to be filed in pieces or in a piecemeal fashion or manner over any given amount of time, unless permission to do so is expressly both requested and granted in writing.

(t) Type of Application. To prevent confusion and any loss of the City’s rights under the FCC’s “shot clock” rule pursuant to the FCC Report and Order 14-153 as reference to the date an application was officially filed and the start of the shot clock regarding the limited time allowed to determine if an application is complete, at the time of the initial filing of an application, it must contain a cover letter stating (1) whether the application is filed as an “eligible facility” application including the justification for such, or a “substantial modification,” or involves a new support structure; and (2) a statement that the application contains all of the information required under this Chapter for that type of application, and be signed by a person with first-hand personal knowledge of such.

(u) Required Commitment Statements. All applications shall include written commitment statements that:

(1) The applicant’s facility shall at all times without exception be maintained in a safe manner, and in compliance with all conditions of the special use permit, as well as all applicable and permissible local codes, ordinances, and regulations and all applicable City, State and Federal Laws, rules, and regulations, unless specifically granted relief by the Commission or City Council in writing;

(2) The construction of the facility is legally permissible, including, but not limited to, the fact that the applicant is licensed to do business in the State.

(v) Number of Applications. An applicant shall submit to the City the number of completed applications determined to be needed at the pre-application meeting as well as computerized copies of such. If Commission action is required, applications will not be transmitted to the Commission for consideration until the application is deemed complete by City staff and a recommended action report is prepared for the Commission’s consideration.

Design Intent, Siting and Applicable Building and Safety Codes.

(w) Minimizing the Visual Impact. For reasons of concealment, all proposed facilities and modifications to facilities shall be designed so as to minimize the physical and visual impact on the community, including but not limited to the use of stealth or camouflaging siting techniques, so as to make the facility substantially invisible, or as nearly so as is reasonably possible.

(x) Least Intrusive Option Required. As a matter of concealment, requiring that the facility shall be the least visually intrusive among those options available, given the facts and circumstances.

(y) Profile. So as to be the least visually intrusive reasonably possible given the facts and circumstances involved and create the smallest profile reasonably possible under the facts and circumstances and thereby have the least adverse visual effect and be substantially invisible, all antennas attached to a tower or other structure shall be flush mounted or as near to flush mounted as is possible, unless it can be proven that such would prohibit or serve to prohibit the provision of service or be technologically impracticable.

(z) Concealment and Harmony with Surroundings. A tower or other support structure and any and all accessory or associated structures and equipment shall maximize the use of building materials, colors and textures designed to harmonize with the natural surroundings so as to make the facility substantially invisible. This shall include the utilization of stealth or camouflage techniques or other concealment methods such as but not limited to abiding by the established or maximum permitted height.

(aa) Required Use of Existing Structures. Unless such is proven to be technologically impracticable, the City requires the co-location of new antenna arrays on existing structures, as opposed to the construction of a new support structure, or for applications submitted subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this Chapter to increase the height, footprint or profile of a facility beyond the maximum permitted height, width or overall profile. In instances involving a substantial modification, or for a new facility subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this Chapter, the applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying all existing structures fifty (50) feet or more in height within one-half (1/2) mile of the location of any proposed new facility.

Co-located equipment shall consist only of the minimum antenna array technologically needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the City, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown in the form of clear and convincing evidence.

(bb) Modifications of a Tower and Tower-Mounted Equipment. So as not to defeat the concealment intent of the maximum permitted height of towers or other support structures, modifications, singly or cumulatively on a single structure, shall not exceed the height allowed under the original permit by more than ten (10) feet, nor shall any lateral modification extend more than ten (10) feet from the lateral extremity of a tower, nor more than three (3) feet from the edge of a non-tower support structure.

(cc) Effect of Lease or Option to Lease on Siting/Location Priorities. The existence of a lease or an option to lease shall not be deemed justification for not complying with the siting priorities set forth in this Chapter. An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority because the site proposed is under lease or an option to lease. If a site other than the number 1 priority is proposed, the applicant must provide clear and convincing technical evidence as to why co-location is technically impracticable or clear and convincing relevant information as to why it would be commercially impracticable. Build-to-suit agreements between carriers and a proposed tower owner shall not be a valid basis for any claim of exemption, exception or waiver from compliance with this Chapter.

(dd) Utilities. All utilities at a facility site shall be installed underground and in compliance with all laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the City, including specifically, but not limited to, applicable electrical codes.

(ee) Vehicular Access. At a facility needing vehicular access, an access road, parking and turn around space for emergency vehicles shall be provided to assure adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing roads, whether public or private, shall be made to the extent practicable. Road construction shall at all times minimize ground disturbance, grade change and the cutting of vegetation. Road grades shall closely follow natural contours to assure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil erosion. If the current access road or turn around space is deemed in disrepair or in need of remedial work to make it serviceable and safe and in compliance with any applicable regulations as determined at a site visit, the application shall contain a commitment to remedy or restore the road or turn around space so that it is serviceable and safe and in compliance with applicable regulations, and may include the installation of gravel, asphalt or other road building materials as determined by the City Engineer or their designee.

(ff) Compliance with Applicable Codes. All work at a facility shall at all times be done in strict compliance with the latest versions or editions of the City’s Code and other applicable regulations and the latest applicable building, technical, safety and safety-related codes adopted by the City, State, or United States, including but not limited to the most recent edition of the TIA ANSI Code, National Electrical Safety Code, the National Electrical Code, the Occupational and Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and policies, recommended practices of the National Association of Tower Erectors and accepted and responsible workmanlike industry practices. The codes referred to are codes that include, but are not limited to, construction, building, electrical, fire, safety, health, land use, public nuisance, blight, graffiti abatement, and noise control or abatement. In the event of a conflict between or among any of the preceding, the more stringent shall apply.

(gg) Certifications. Where a certification is called for, such certification shall bear the signature and seal of a professional engineer licensed in the State of California.

(hh) Permits and Licenses. A holder of a special use permit or administrative special use permit granted under this Chapter shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses required by applicable law, ordinance, rule, regulation or code, and must maintain the same, in full force and effect, for as long as required by the City or other governmental entity or agency having jurisdiction over the applicant.

(ii) Compliance with Law. All facilities, must at all times comply with all applicable local, State and Federal laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to applicable safety rules, regulations and standards, including but not limited to any noise control or noise abatement requirements, restriction or standards of the City or County.

(jj) DAS and small cell nodes that are owned or operated by a commercial carrier and are part of a commercial wireless system, or when activated are capable of being used for commercial purposes by the general public, are expressly included in the context of this Chapter, regardless of the location or whether the facility is located inside or outside a structure or building.

Other Policies.

(kk) Community Outreach Meeting. To provide an opportunity for the community to understand what is proposed and its impact, and to have input to the applicant, at the City’s option given the facts and circumstances involved, for any i) new support structure, ii) any substantial modification or iii) any modification that would increase the height of the facility by five (5) feet or more or increase the size of the profile by two (2) feet or more horizontally, a community outreach meeting may be required to be held between the applicant, the property owners, the residents and businesses in the area of the proposed site or work and the City. At least two (2) weeks prior to the date of the meeting written notice of the meeting and its purpose shall be provided to all property owners, residents and businesses located within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet of the site. The meeting shall be held on a weeknight no earlier than 7:00 p.m. and no later than 8:00 p.m. All costs related to the meeting shall be borne solely by the applicant, including but not limited to the cost of written notification.

(ll) Shared Use. The owner of a tower or other support structure, and his/her successors in interest, shall negotiate in good faith for the shared use of the facility for co-location by other wireless service providers, and shall:

(1) Respond within sixty (60) days to a request for information from a potential shared-use applicant;

(2) Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the new wireless telecommunications facility by other telecommunications providers;

(3) Allow shared use of the new wireless telecommunications facility if another telecommunications provider agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges;

(4) Understand that failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds for revocation of the special use permit.

(mm) Denial of a Noneligible Facility Application. The City may, for just reason and cause, deny an application for anything that does not meet the requirements stated herein or which is otherwise not complete or as set forth in Section 10-16.115. (Ord. 487 § 3 (part), 2015)

Sec. 10-16.109 Processing Fees to Be Borne by Applicant.
(a) The City may hire a consultant to assist the City in reviewing and evaluating applications.

(b) The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in the City’s Master Fee Schedule, as may be modified from time to time, may vary with the scope and complexity of the application, the completeness of the application and other information as may be needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any construction or modification.

(c) Preliminary informational discussions totaling less than one (1) hour cumulatively shall be allowed in order to provide initial information related to the application process. However, to prevent the taxpayers from having to bear the cost related to the issue of permitting and regulating wireless telecommunications facilities and support structures, an applicant shall place with the City a deposit as set forth in the City’s Master Fee Schedule (which is modified from time to time) which shall be maintained in an escrow account for that application. The deposit is intended to cover all reasonable costs of any consultant, with twenty percent (20%) overhead charge and City staff time, plus twenty percent (20%) overhead in connection with the review of either an administrative special use permit or special use permit application described herein (excluding building permitting, plan check and inspection services), and any pre-application submittal review or evaluation requested by the applicant and any lease negotiations. The payment of the deposit fee with the City shall precede a site visit, pre-application meeting and any work being done that is related to an intended application or lease.

(d) If at any time during the review process this escrow account has a balance less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), the applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the City, replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least five thousand dollars ($5,000) or such other amount as determined by the Planning Director to be needed given the anticipated amount of work remaining on the application. Such additional funds must be deposited with the City before any further review, consideration or action is taken on the application. In the event that the amount held in the escrow account is more than the amount of the actual billing or invoicing at the time of the grant of the certificate of completion, the remaining balance shall be promptly refunded to the applicant upon request.

(e) If an application is amended at any time prior to the grant of the permit or authorization required under this Chapter, the City reserves the right to require a separate and additional payment for review and analysis equal to, but not exceeding, the cost created for the City by the amendment of the application. Such amount shall be paid to the City prior to the issuance of the special use permit or administrative special use permit.

(f) The City will maintain an accounting for the expenditure of all such funds. The City’s consultant/expert shall invoice the City for all time expended for its services in reviewing the application including the on-site inspections of the construction and modification once permitted, plus out-of-pocket expenses. Billing of consultant time will have a twenty percent (20%) administration charge added. Additionally, any City staff time with twenty percent (20%) overhead plus any hard costs such as publications, mailing, and copies shall also be tabulated and added to the total billable costs.

(g) The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in the City’s Master Fee Schedule may vary with the scope and complexity and/or the completeness of the application or the amount of time spent responding to an applicant’s questions as regards the requirements of this Chapter or other applicable law, rule or regulation. (Ord. 487 § 3 (part), 2015)

Sec. 10-16.110 Application Requirements for an Administrative Special Use Permit.
Application requirements shall include but not be limited to the following items, be deemed complete, and must receive administrative approval by the City Planning Department, or City Manager designee, for the construction or installation of qualifying improvements prior to seeking the issuance of a building permit:

(g) The size of the property footprint on which the structure to be built or attached to is located, stated both in square feet and lot line dimensions, and a survey showing the location of all lot lines;

(h) The location, size and height of all existing and proposed structures, enclosures and cabinets on the property on which the structure is located and that are related to the subject of the application;

(i) A site plan to scale showing the footprint of the support structure and the type, location and dimensions of access drives, landscaping and buffers, fencing, distances between property lines and adjacent structures and any other requirements of site plans;

(j) Elevation drawings showing the profile or the vertical rendition of the facility and identifying all existing and proposed attachments and all related fixtures, structures, appurtenances and apparatus, including the height above the existing grade, materials, colors and lighting;

(k) The azimuth, size and center line height location of all proposed and existing antennas on the supporting structure;

(l) The type and design of the facility, the number of antenna arrays proposed to be accommodated and the basis for the calculations of the facility’s capacity to accommodate the required number of antenna arrays for which the structure must be designed;

(m) All applications shall contain proof of a performance security and liability insurance and a letter of indemnification, in conformity with City provisions listed in this Chapter.

Design, Visibility and Aesthetics.

(n) After the adoption of this Chapter, the maximum permitted width or profile of a new tower, including any attachments, shall not exceed ten (10) feet, absent clear and convincing technical evidence documenting the need for a larger profile.

(o) Flush Mounting. All new or replacement antennas shall be flush mounted or as close to flush mounted on the support structure as possible, unless it can be demonstrated by clear and convincing technical evidence that such has the effect of prohibiting the provision of service to the intended service area, alone or in combination with another site(s), or unless the applicant can prove that it is technologically impracticable.

(p) Placement on Building Facade. If attached to a building, all antennas shall be mounted on the facade of the building and camouflaged so as to match the color and, if possible, the texture of the building, or in a manner so as to make the antennas and cabling as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given the facts and circumstances involved.

(q) Least Visually Intrusive Means. As a matter of concealment, all applications for a proposed facility and any equipment applicable to this Chapter shall contain clear and convincing evidence that the facility is sited and designed so as to create the least visual intrusiveness reasonably possible given the facts and circumstances involved, and thereby will have the least adverse visual effect on the environment and its character, on existing vegetation, and be substantially invisible to the community in the area of the facility. The City expressly reserves the right to require the use of stealth or camouflage siting and deployment techniques, including but not limited to DAS (distributive antenna system) type and small cell type nodes or the functional equivalent of such to achieve this goal and such shall be subject to approval by the Commission.

(r) Facility Finish/Color. Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint of an appropriate color to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter.

(s) Lighting. No tower or support structure constructed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter shall be tall enough to require lighting. In the event lighting is legally unavoidable and is required, the applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under State and Federal regulations. For any facility for which lighting is required under the FAA’s regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air, but that prevents the ground scatter effect so that it is not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least twelve (12) degrees vertical for a distance of at least one (1) mile in a level terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict with FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light is able to be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.

As of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter, in the event a tower that is lighted is modified, at the time of the modification, for purposes of concealment, the City may require that the tower be retrofitted so as to comply with the lighting requirements of this Chapter.

(t) Screening. The applicant shall provide a description in writing and a visual rendering demonstrating how it proposes to effectively screen from view the bottom fifteen (15) feet of the facility and all related equipment and structures associated with the facility.

(u) Visual Impact Assessment. The applicant shall furnish a visual impact assessment, which shall include:

(1) A computer generated “Zone of Visibility Map” at a minimum of one (1) mile radius from the proposed structure shall be provided to illustrate locations from which the proposed installation may be seen, with and without foliage;

(2) Pictorial representations (photo simulations) of “before and after” views from key viewpoints inside of the City as may be appropriate and required, including but not limited to state highways and other major roads, state and local parks, other public lands, historic districts, preserves and historic sites normally open to the public, and from any other location where the site is visible to a large number of visitors, travelers or residents. Guidance will be provided concerning the appropriate key viewpoints at the pre-application meeting. In addition to photographic simulations to scale showing the visual impact, the applicant shall provide a map showing the locations of where the pictures were taken and the distance(s) of each location from the proposed structure.

Safety.

(v) Age. The age of the facility in years, including the date of the grant of the original permit;

(w) Description. A description of the type of tower, e.g., guyed, self-supporting lattice or monopole;

(x) Tower Details. The make, model, type and manufacturer of the tower and the structural design analysis and report, including the calculations, certified by a professional engineer licensed in the State and proving the facility’s capability to safely accommodate the facilities of the applicant without change or modification;

(y) Changes Narrative. If a modification of a facility is needed whereby the height, profile or size of the facility is increased, or construction is needed outside the compound or property, a detailed narrative explaining what changes are needed and why they are needed;

(z) Foundation. A copy of the foundation design, including a geotechnical subsurface soils investigation report and foundation design recommendation for the tower or other structure;

(aa) Physical Condition. If modifying an existing tower or other support structure, an ANSI TIA 222 Report regarding the current physical condition of the facility and its components done within the previous six (6) months. If such report has not been done within the previous six (6) months, one (1) shall be conducted and submitted as part of the application;

(bb) Remediation. No building permit shall be issued for any wireless facility or related equipment where the structure being attached to is in need of remediation to comply with the requirements of this Chapter and other adopted standards of the City or State and Federal regulations, unless and until all remediation work that is deemed needed has been completed or a schedule for the remediation work has been approved by the City Planning Department;

(cc) Structural Analysis. The applicant shall provide certified documentation in the form of a structural analysis, including any assumptions and calculations, proving that the proposed facility modifications will meet all local, State and Federal structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads, and including but not limited to all applicable ANSI (American National Standards Institute) TIA 222 guidelines. In the event of a conflict the more stringent shall apply;

(dd) RF Emissions Report. A cumulative RF emissions study and report accounting for all RF emitting equipment at the facility, cumulatively, including a description of the methodology used, any assumptions made and showing the calculations;

(ee) RF Emissions On-Site Survey. In certain instances the City may deem it appropriate to have an on-site RF survey of the facility done after the construction or modification and activation of the facility. Such survey shall be done under the observation and direction of the City or its designee, and an un-redacted copy of the survey results provided, along with all calculations, prior to issuance of a certificate of compliance;

(ff) RF Emissions Remediation. A signed statement that the applicant will expeditiously remedy any physical or RF interference with other wireless devices or services;

(gg) FAA Determination. A written copy of an analysis completed by a qualified individual or organization to determine if the proposed wireless telecommunications facility is in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration Regulation Part 77 and if it requires lighting.

If this analysis determines that an FAA determination is required, then all filings with the FAA, all responses from the FAA and any related correspondence shall be provided with the application. (Ord. 487 § 3 (part), 2015)

Sec. 10-16.111 Application Requirements for a Special Use Permit.
The process for permitting and the information required under this Chapter shall be the same as in Section 10-16.110, Application Requirements for an Administrative Special Use Permit, except the following additional items shall also apply to and be required prior to a decision being made by the Planning Commission at a public hearing prior to seeking the issuance of a building permit for any construction or installation of a new facility or major modification project:

Proof of Technical Need.

(a) For a new tower or other new support structure the applicant shall be required to submit clear and convincing evidence that a new tower or support structure is the only type of structure within one-half (1/2) mile of the proposed tower or support structure that will enable the provision of wireless services primarily within the City.

(b) Documentation that the facility is necessary for that carrier to provide service in the community and that co-location on an existing structure is not feasible.

(c) Documentation that co-location on an existing structure is not reasonably feasible if co-location is technically or commercially impracticable or the owner of the structure is unwilling to enter into a contract for such use. Sufficient documentation in the form of clear and convincing evidence to support such claims shall be submitted with an application to determine whether co-location on existing structures is reasonably feasible and to document the need for a specific stated height, and that less height will serve to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service.

Design of Towers (Type, Height, Setback and Fall Zones).

(d) To enable a new tower or other new support structure to be extended in height at a future date, if needed, the wireless telecommunications facility shall be structurally designed to accommodate at least four (4) antenna arrays, with each array to be flush mounted unless clear and convincing technical evidence demonstrates the impracticability of flush mounting.

(e) All new towers shall be of the monopole type. No new towers of a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly requested and granted based on the provision of clear and convincing technical evidence.

(f) The maximum permitted total height of a new tower or support structure shall be thirty-five (35) feet above pre-construction ground level, unless it can be shown by clear and convincing technical evidence that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area within the City. The maximum permitted height is expressly not an as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height absent clear and convincing technical evidence of the technological need for a greater height, and should take into consideration the ability to co-locate other carriers in the future.

(g) As the City has made the policy decision that more facilities of a shorter height is in the public interest, as opposed to fewer taller facilities, spacing or the distance between facilities shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.

(h) The applicant for a new tower shall submit clear and convincing technical evidence by a carrier or wireless service provider justifying the total height of the proposed facility and the need for such to the exclusion of all reasonable alternatives. Evidence in the form of propagation studies must include all modeling data and assumptions used to produce the studies at the requested height and at a height ten (10) feet lower to show that any lower height would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service and should take into consideration the ability to co-locate other carriers in the future.

(i) The City reserves the right to require a drive test to be conducted under the supervision of the City or its designee as evidence of the technical need for what is requested.

(j) With respect to the overall designed strength of a tower, but not with respect to height, towers shall be structurally designed to accommodate a minimum of four (4) carriers using substantially similar equipment to that used by the first carrier attaching to a tower and that can be increased in height if needed for technical reasons.

(k) Setback and Fall Zone. All proposed towers and any new proposed support structures shall be set back from abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines by the greater of the following distances: (1) a distance equal to the height of the proposed tower or support structure plus ten percent (10%) of the height of the tower or other structure, otherwise known as the fall zone; or (2) the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater. Any accessory structure shall be located within the fenced compound area as approved in the special use permit and so as to comply with the applicable minimum setback requirements for the property on which it is situated. The fall zone shall be measured from the nearest edge of the tower to the nearest portion of the right-of-way of any public road or thoroughfare and any occupied building or domicile, as well as any property boundary lines. At the discretion of the Commission, the preceding may not apply to support structures located in the public rights-of-way so long as required minimum distances to adjacent buildings are complied with.

(l) The nearest portion of any access road leading to a facility shall be no less than ten (10) feet from the nearest property line.

(m) There shall be no development or human occupation of habitable buildings within the setback area or fall zone.

Community Outreach in the Case of a New Tower.

(n) In order to better inform the public, the applicant shall be responsible for notifying the public by mail as well as through on-site signage, placing a story pole, and producing a photo simulation report as more specifically detailed below prior to being considered by the City’s approving body:

(1) Story Pole. The applicant shall arrange to place a “story pole” at the exact proposed tower location and raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a ten (10) feet in length, brightly colored flags/balloons at the maximum height of the proposed new tower in the same vertical and horizontal dimensions as the proposed antenna for at least forty-eight (48) consecutive hours immediately preceding and through the end of the community meeting.

(2) On-Site Signage. A four (4) foot by eight (8) foot sign shall be erected prior to community meeting notices being mailed so as to be clearly visible from the road nearest the proposed site and shall be easily readable from the road by a person with 20/20 vision. Such sign shall be placed off, but as near to, the public right-of-way as is possible and contain the times and date(s) of the initial community outreach meeting and contact information.

(3) Draft Community Meeting Notices. At least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of mailing community meeting notices, the applicant shall provide a one (1) page draft copy of a public outreach notice for approval to the City and its consultant, if applicable, to include the date the story pole will be in place and the date, time, and place of the community outreach meeting and description and elevation of the proposed project.

(4) Mailing Community Meeting Notices. The applicant shall mail the above approved community meeting notices by first-class mail to all property owners, residents, and businesses located within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet of the nearest property line of the subject property of the proposed construction of the tower and wireless facility (with a certified/reproducible copy of the mailing labels being provided to the City) at least fourteen (14) days, but no more than twenty-one (21) days, prior to the community outreach meeting. The applicant shall bear all costs associated with said notification.

(5) A report with before and superimposed after photo simulations from various locations of the story pole and to scale superimposed photo simulations of the proposed facility when completed shall be provided as part of the application. (Ord. 487 § 3 (part), 2015)

Sec. 10-16.112 Streamlined Process—Requirements for an Application to Co-Locate on an Existing Properly Permitted Telecommunications Facility or Existing Building Structure within the Parameters of an Approved Special Use Permit, but Not Including the First Attachment.
(a) The process for permitting and the information required under this Chapter shall be the same as in Section 10-16.110, Application Requirements for an Administrative Special Use Permit, for an application qualifying for the streamlined process.

(b) An application to increase the parameters of an approved wireless telecommunications facility as it relates to height, profile, number of co-locations or footprint shall not qualify for streamlined treatment under this Chapter.

(c) Small Cell Sites. An application proposing the use of small cell technology in the public rights-of-way that does not increase the height of an existing structure being attached to by more than four (4) feet shall be entitled to the streamlined process. If increasing the height of a building by between four (4) feet and eight (8) feet the application may also be reviewed under the streamlined process, provided the applicant will install an RF translucent false facade or parapet that matches the style, color and texture of the building.

(d) Attachments to Buildings. To preserve and protect the nature and character of the area and enable the site to be substantially invisible, for any attachment to a building or other structure with a facade, the antennas shall be mounted on the facade without increasing the height of the building or other structure, unless it can be proven that such will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service, and all such attachments and exteriorly encased or exposed cabling shall match as closely as possible the color and texture of the structure.

(e) Attachments to Water Tanks. If attaching to a water tank, in order to maintain the current profile and height, mounting on the top of the tank or the use of a corral shall only be permitted if the applicant can prove that to locate elsewhere on the tank with less visual effect will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service or will create a safety hazard.

(f) The applicant shall provide a certification by a professional engineer licensed in the State, along with documentation in the form of a structural analysis, including calculations, that prove that the support structure and its foundation as proposed to be utilized are designed and were constructed to meet all City, State, Federal and TIA ANSI 222 structural requirements for loads, including wind and ice loads.

(c) As generally discussed in the Hercules Zoning Ordinance Section 40.800, Environmental Review, all proposed projects and applications are subject to environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The City may not regulate sitings based on RF emissions to the extent that the facilities comply with FCC standards, however, this does not relieve the City from the obligation to study any significant environmental effects caused by RF emissions. The construction of wireless communication facilities is subject to environmental review under both Federal and State law and all antenna structures must comply with NEPA. Smaller facilities may be categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to guidelines in Section 15303.

(d) Either after the public hearing, if a hearing is required, or after administrative review as applicable, and after formally considering the application, the City may (1) approve; (2) approve with conditions; or (3) deny a permit or administrative authorization. The decision shall be in writing and shall be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. Throughout the application and permitting process, the burden of proof for compliance with this Chapter, or the need for something not allowed, shall always be upon the applicant.

(e) All application approvals shall contain various written conditions of approval that are required (1) prior to building permit issuance, (2) prior to final inspections/certificate of completion, and (3) post-completion requirements such as but not limited to long-term facility and site maintenance blight abatement, graffiti abatement and nuisance abatement (which is generally defined in Section 4-10.04) and all general policies of this Chapter.

(f) Wireless telecommunications facilities surrounding landscaping, fencing, and related transmission equipment and building must be maintained in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans. All graffiti on wireless communication facilities or compounds must be removed within forty-eight (48) hours of notification by the City.

(g) If the City approves the special use permit or administrative special use permit for the facility, then a notice of decision shall be posted within a public area of City Hall and mailed to the applicant within ten (10) working days of the City’s action. The special use permit or administrative special use permit shall be effective ten (10) working days after the posting or mailing of the approval decision.

(h) If the City denies the special use permit or administrative special use permit for the facility or the modification, then the applicant shall be orally notified of such denial with specific reasons for such denial by the Planning Department or at the Commission meeting depending on the reviewing body, and in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of the decision, and shall set forth in writing the reason or reasons for the denial.

(i) Any discretionary decision may be appealed by the applicant or any person affected by a determination or decision. Discretionary decisions made by the Planning Department are appealable to the Planning Commission while Planning Commission decisions are appealable to City Council as outlined in the City of Hercules Zoning Ordinance Chapter 44. (Ord. 487 § 3 (part), 2015)

Chapter 17. West County Subregional Transportation Mitigation Program Update
10-17.101 Title.
The title of this Chapter is the West County Subregional Transportation Mitigation Program 2019 Update. (Ord. 523 § 1 (part), 2019)

10-17.102 Purpose.
The purpose of the STMP update and the STMP fee set forth in this Chapter is to meet the intent of Measure J by levying a fee on new development to mitigate the regional impacts of new trips generated by that development. Further, the purpose of the STMP fee set forth in this Chapter is to raise funds for regional transportation projects in West County. (Ord. 523 § 1 (part), 2019)

10-17.103 Findings.
(a) The STMP fee is required to defray all or a portion of the costs of building transportation capital improvement projects needed to mitigate impacts of new development projects.

(b) The STMP fee will raise funds for twenty (20) projects, in the general categories of freeway and interchange improvements, local street and intersection improvements, transit and station-related improvements, bicycle and pedestrian-focused improvements, and complete streets projects. A detailed description of the projects can be found in Section 10-17.105.

(c) The total cost of the twenty (20) projects is approximately eight hundred fifty-five million dollars ($855,000,000) in 2018 dollars. The nexus study report determined the maximum amount of eligible funding that could be collected through the STMP program at one hundred sixty-one million eight hundred thousand dollars ($161,800,000).

(d) The nexus findings, in conformance with Government Code Section 66000 et seq., can be found in the “2019 Nexus Update of the Subregional Transportation Mitigation Program (STMP) Impact Fee” (hereinafter referred to as the 2019 STMP Nexus Update) prepared by Fehr & Peers for WCCTAC dated December 2018. Two (2) copies of the 2019 STMP Nexus Update are on file with the City Clerk/Clerk of the Board and is incorporated herein by reference (and also provided as Exhibit A to the ordinance codified in this Chapter).

(e) The 2019 STMP Nexus Update included the following steps:

• Projecting the amount of new development anticipated in West County;

• Setting criteria for identifying eligible capital improvement projects;

• Specifying the transportation improvements needed to accommodate growth;

• Evaluating the relationship between the improvements, the share of funding from new development, and the impacts of new trip generation;

• Allocating the costs across land use types; and

• Preparing fee schedules and implementation documents.

(f) After considering the 2019 STMP Nexus Update, the testimony received at a noticed public hearing, the agenda statements, the General Plan, and all correspondence received (together, the “Record”), the City Council approves and adopts the 2019 STMP Nexus Update and incorporates such report herein by reference.

(g) Adoption of the STMP fee set forth in this Chapter, as it relates to development within the City, is intended to obtain funds for capital projects necessary to maintain service within the WCCTAC area. Accordingly, this fee, as it relates to development within the City, is not a “project” within the meaning of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(b)(8)(D)).

(h) The Record establishes and finds:

• That there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the STMP fee set forth in this Chapter (funding for transportation capital infrastructure projects) and the type of development projects on which this fee is imposed in that all development in the City —both residential and nonresidential—will contribute to the need for the projects listed in Section 10-17.105; and

• That there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the projects listed in Section 10-17.105 and the type of development projects on which this fee is imposed in that new development in the City—both residential and nonresidential—will generate persons who live, work, shop, travel to and from, commute to and from, and visit the City and who, therefore, contribute to the need for the projects listed in Section 10-17.105; and

• That there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee set forth in this Chapter and the cost of the projects listed in Section 10-17.105 or portion of such projects attributable to the development on which this fee is imposed in that such fee is calculated based on projections described in the 2019 STMP Nexus Update of new development, the total cost of the projects listed in Section 10-17.105, and allocation of a fair share of costs to new development across the various land use types. (Ord. 523 § 1 (part), 2019)

10-17.104 Fees.
(a) Levy of the Fee and Fee Structure. In order to fund the program and projects stated herein, the following updated STMP fee schedule shall be implemented July 1, 2019, and shall terminate on March 31, 2040.

City is responsible for determining the appropriate land use category and fee amount to apply to specific development projects being considered by their jurisdiction. Agency will refer to the STMP administrative guidelines for guidance on how to apply these land use categories to development projects.

(b) No development shall be exempt from the fee, except if application of the fee to the development would be unlawful under and/or conflict with Federal, State, or local law and/or regulation. In addition, accessory dwelling units within the footprint of an existing dwelling unit’s habitable space are not required to pay the STMP fee.

(c) A project that reconstructs or reuses an existing structure or development that has been occupied within the previous three (3) years is subject to the fee only to the extent that it would generate more a.m. peak hour vehicle trips than the existing development.

(d) Fees for uses not identified in subsection (a) of this Section shall be determined by the City using the “Other” land use type and according to methodology provided by WCCTAC in the STMP master cooperative agreement and the STMP administrative guidelines. The STMP administrative guidelines are incorporated into the STMP master cooperative agreement and provided for reference as Exhibit B to the ordinance codified in this Chapter, and may be changed from time to time by the WCCTAC Executive Director. The current version of the STMP administrative guidelines is available from WCCTAC or the City Clerk.

(e) An applicant may receive credit against fees for the dedication of land for right-of-way and/or construction of improvements for 2019 STMP projects listed in Section 10-17.105 where such right-of-way or construction is beyond that which would otherwise be required for approval of the proposed development. The calculation of the amount of credit against fees for 2019 STMP dedications or improvements shall be based upon a determination by the City that such credits are in fact exclusive of the dedications, setbacks, improvements, and/or traffic mitigation measures which are required by local ordinance, standards, or other practice. In addition, the credit shall be calculated based upon the actual cost of construction of improvements or, in the case of land dedication, on an independent appraisal approved by the local jurisdiction. The City must report any credit to WCCTAC prior to awarding the credit.

An applicant may receive reimbursement from STMP fees paid by other development projects to the extent that the amount of the credit is greater than the STMP fee obligation of the development project. The award of any credit or reimbursement by the City must be preapproved by the WCCTAC Board; in making that decision, the Board will take into consideration criteria and metrics related to funding availability and project prioritization that they use in making other STMP funding decisions.

(f) The fees specified herein shall be made a condition of approval of all tentative and final subdivision maps. The fees shall be collected at the time of the issuance of any building permit.

(g) The STMP fees specified above shall be collected for projects in the entire City.

(h) Fees paid pursuant to this Chapter shall be deposited in a separate segregated interestbearing account, and, together with any interest accumulated on amounts on deposit, shall be remitted on a quarterly basis along with the required quarterly report to WCCTAC or its designee, to be placed in a fund to be used solely for the purposes described in this Chapter and in the master cooperative agreement. Any interest accumulated on such funds shall also be used only for the purposes specified in this Chapter.

(i) The fees will be used for, but are not limited to, the administration of the STMP, planning, environmental documentation, design, acquisition of rightofway, and construction of the projects.

(j) Effective July 1, 2020, and on each subsequent anniversary date of such date, the amount of each of the developer fees, set forth in subsection (a) of this Section, shall increase or decrease by the annual percentage change in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index for the San Francisco Bay Area for the for the twelve (12) month period ending with the February index of the same calendar year. The percentage change will be calculated by WCCTAC, which will notify all signatories to the cooperative agreement of the change.

(k) Pursuant to Government Code Section 66001(d), after the fifth fiscal year following the first deposit of 2019 STMP revenues and every five (5) years thereafter, WCCTAC shall make all required findings with respect to that portion of the fee account or fund remaining unexpended, whether committed or uncommitted. Such findings shall be made in connection with the release of public information required by Government Code Section 66006(b).

(l) Pursuant to Government Code Section 66006, as specified, WCCTAC shall submit a public report to the WCCTAC Board on an annual basis, identifying the amount of fee revenues collected and other statutorily required information, which will also be shared with agencies’ city managers/county administrator.

(m) An applicant may appeal the determination of the amount of the STMP fee due, and such appeal shall be made in writing to WCCTAC with supporting documentation. The WCCTAC Board shall consider the appeal at a regularly scheduled meeting, and shall make a decision on the appeal. The decision of the WCCTAC Board is final. (Ord. 523 § 1 (part), 2019)

(Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

Article 2. Park and Recreation Facilities Impact Fees

Sec. 10-18.201 Intent and Purpose.
The City Council of the City of Hercules finds and declares:

(a) As a result of increasing regional growth, significant residential development is expected to occur within the City.

(b) The new residents will require additional park and recreation facilities. The park and recreation facilities which serve the existing population will become overburdened if also required to serve all new development.

(c) The general plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the City and places limits on the intensity and density of such use. The City Council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the general plan and the rate and amount of actual and projected development of property within the City. Based upon this examination, the City Council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the City Council to project, with substantial certainty, the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the City’s general plan.

(d) Based, upon projected growth and development permitted under the general plan, a substantial amount of residential development will occur in the City before the City is fully built out.

(e) This anticipated development cumulatively will generate a substantial increase in the demand for park and recreation facilities. New development will thus create an additional burden on the existing facilities and the need for new and expanded facilities.

(f) If additional park and recreation facilities are not provided as development occurs, the existing facilities will not be adequate to serve the community. This could result in adverse impacts, such as overcrowding and overuse of the present park and recreation facilities, injuries related to park and recreation facility use, lack of facilities for youth activities, and lack of facilities or space for community groups and gatherings. This shortage of park and recreation facilities would lead to a deterioration of the public services which the residents in Hercules now enjoy.

(g) To prevent these undesirable consequences, the capacity of the City’s park and recreation facilities must be built at a rate which would accommodate the expected growth in the City.

(h) There is limited land suitable for the development of park and recreation facilities. The City will need to acquire and develop land parcels which are practicably available to satisfy the parks and recreation needs of future residents.

(i) The park and recreation system is a citywide system, providing recreation opportunities to the entire community.

(j) Although the demand for public services generated by an individual development project may not be, in and of itself, sufficient to overload the City’s existing park facilities, the unmitigated cumulative impact of all new development would result in an unacceptable burden.

(k) It is the policy of the City that new development pay for the cost of new parks and recreation facilities and improvements to existing parks and recreation facilities which are necessary to accommodate the demands generated by new development. In the absence of a park and recreation facilities fee, existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund a substantial portion of the improvements which are necessary to avoid an unacceptable deterioration of public services.

(1) All types of residential development require and use the park and recreation facilities. The estimates of public demands for park and recreation facilities generated by a particular development are based on the average number of people residing in that particular type of residential development.

(m) In its evaluation, the City Council has taken into consideration, among other things, the Comprehensive Impact Fee Study for the City of Hercules dated February 21, 2001 (the “Comprehensive Impact Fee Study”). That Comprehensive Impact Fee Study and, in particular, the portion dedicated to Park and Recreation Facilities identifies the standards for development of parks and recreation facilities, the estimated demand for new facilities in the future, and the proportion of that future demand which will be generated by new development. The City Council finds that these facts and that study represent a reasonable estimate of the needed facilities and costs thereof.

(n) A fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to construct the required park and recreation facilities is to impose a park and recreation facilities fee based on the extent to which new development generates demand for additional park and recreation facilities.

(o) The Comprehensive Impact Fee Study identifies the amount of park land and type and cost of park and recreation facilities for that land necessary to accommodate future growth.

(p) The park and recreation facilities that will be constructed with funds generated by the Park and Recreation Facilities Impact Fee will significantly benefit the community in that the adverse impacts and inconvenience which would otherwise be caused by a declining level of public parks and recreation facilities will be substantially mitigated. Persons who undertake new development in the City are benefitted by a desirable community and the City’s reputation for providing, and ability to provide, a variety of well-run public services, including park and recreation facilities. Such facilities make the community a safe and appealing place to live and to work.

(q) Pursuant to Government Code Section 66001, and based upon the terms of this Article, the City Council finds that:

(1) The purpose of this fee is to provide adequate park and recreation facilities to serve new development within the City.

(2) The fee will be used for acquisition, construction, improvement and/or development of park and recreation land and facilities, including but not limited to, existing and needed neighborhood parks, community parks, teen centers, child care facilities, cultural arts centers, community facilities and other park and recreational facilities necessary to accommodate new residential development.

(3) Completed parks and recreation facilities are needed by all types of residential development, based upon the average number of City residents.

(4) The amount of the fee bears a fair and reasonable relationship to each residential development’s burden on and benefit from the City’s park and recreational facilities to be funded by the fee, and shall be based on the following considerations:

A. New development will pay only for those park and recreation facilities which serve the demands which will be created by new development.

B. Each type of residential development shall contribute to the needed park facilities in proportion to the average number of residents for the particular type of dwelling unit.

C. The amount of the fee is calculated based upon the need for park facilities once development occurs, and the per person cost for those facilities.

(r) Periodic review, and possible revision, of the fee resolution adopted by the City Council under this Article will allow for the adjustment of the fee to ensure that the fee remains a fair and equitable method for the distribution of costs to construct park and recreation facilities necessary to accommodate the need generated by new development.

(s) The Comprehensive Impact Fee Study for the City of Hercules dated February 21, 2001 and future City Council-approved amendments thereto are approved, incorporated here by reference, and provide the technical information and reasoning upon which the fee is based. (Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

Sec. 10-18.206 Use of Fee.
The City shall deposit the fees collected under this Article in a special fund, the Park and Recreation Facilities Impact Fee Fund, designated for park and recreation facilities improvements. The fees and any interest earned shall be used only to provide park and recreation facilities in accordance with standards stated in the City’s General Plan, the Hercules Capital Improvement Program or the budget of the City, to reimburse the City for its reasonable costs in administering this Article, or to reimburse the City for such construction if funds were advanced by the City from other sources, or a combination of the above. (Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

(Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

Sec. 10-18.208 General Provisions Apply.
All of the provisions of Article 1 apply to the park and recreation facilities impact fee. (Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

Article 3. General Public Facilities Impact Fee

Sec. 10-18.301 Intent and Purpose.
(a) As a result of increasing regional growth, significant residential, commercial and industrial development is expected to occur within the City.

(b) City government requires buildings and equipment for City employees to serve the public. The City now has or will need certain general public facilities including City administration buildings, a corporation yard for public works, senior centers, libraries and other facilities needed to serve the public.

(c) The general plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the City and places limits on the intensity and density of such use. The City Council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the general plan and the rate and amount of actual development of property within the City. Based upon this examination, the City Council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the Council to project, with substantial certainty, the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the City’s general plan.

(d) Based upon projected growth and development permitted under the general plan, a substantial amount of residential, commercial and industrial development will occur in the City before the City is fully built out.

(e) This anticipated development cumulatively will generate a substantial increase in the need for City services and the corresponding general public facilities necessary to provide those services. New development will thus create an additional burden on the existing general public facilities.

(f) If additional general public facilities are not added as development occurs, the existing facilities will not be adequate to serve the community. This could result in adverse impacts, such as inadequate space for City employees, the public works corporation yard, building safety and human services activities, and inadequate libraries. This shortage of general public facilities would lead to a deterioration of the public services which the residents, employees and property owners in Hercules now enjoy.

(g) To prevent these undesirable circumstances, the capacity of the City’s general public facilities must be built at a rate which will accommodate the expected growth in the City.

(h) Although the need for public services generated by an individual development project may not be, in and of itself, sufficient to overload the City’s existing general public facilities, the unmitigated cumulative impact of all new development, including but not limited to development currently submitted for approval, will result in an unacceptable burden.

(i) It is the policy of the City that new development pay for the cost of the improvements to and for new general public facilities which are necessary to accommodate the public services needs generated by new development. In the absence of this ordinance imposing a general public facilities impact fee, existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund a substantial portion of the general public facilities improvements which are necessary to avoid an unacceptable deterioration of public services.

(j) All types of development require and use public services and the associated general public facilities, although to different degrees. The City Council has examined the extent to which different land uses rely upon the City’s services and general public facilities. In its evaluation, the Council has taken into consideration, among other things, the Comprehensive Impact Fee Study for the City of Hercules dated February 21, 2001 (the “Comprehensive Impact Fee Study”). That Study identifies the estimated use of public services and facilities by all new persons coming to the City, including residents and daytime population. The City Council finds that these use factors represent a reasonable estimate of the actual use of public services and facilities.

(k) A fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to construct the required general public facilities improvements is to impose a general public facilities impact fee based on the extent to which new development generates the need for additional general public facilities.

(l) The Comprehensive Impact Fee Study identifies general public facilities improvements which are necessary to accommodate future growth.

(m) The general public facilities improvements that will be constructed or paid for with funds generated by this Article will significantly benefit the contributor in that the adverse impacts and inconvenience which would otherwise be caused by a declining level of public services will be substantially mitigated. Persons who undertake new development in the City are benefitted by a desirable community and the City’s reputation for providing and ability to provide a variety of well-run public services. Such services make the community a safe and appealing place to live and to work.

(n) Pursuant to Government Code Section 66001, and based upon the Comprehensive Impact Fee Study and the terms of this Article, the City Council finds:

(1) The purpose of this fee is to provide adequate general public facilities improvements to serve new development within the City.

(2) The improvements for which the fee can be used are generally identified in the Comprehensive Impact Fee Study.

(3) General public facilities fee improvements are needed by all types of development, based upon (A) the average number of single family and multi-family residences and (B) the average number of daytime employees per square foot for industrial, retail/services, office building space or hotel rooms.

(4) The amount of the fee bears a fair and reasonable relationship to each development’s burden on and benefit from the City’s public services and general public facilities improvements to be funded by the fee, and shall be based on the following considerations:

New development will pay only for those general public facilities which serve new development and are necessary to serve the public services needs which will be created by new development. The cost of improvements needed to alleviate existing deficiencies in general public facilities, if any, are not included in this fee.

Each type of development shall contribute to the needed improvements in proportion to the use of public services and general public facilities anticipated by that type of development. The fee shall be based on the average number of residents or daytime employees for the particular land use, and the estimated average use of particular facilities.

(o) Periodic review, and possible revision, of the fee resolution adopted by the City Council under this Article will allow for the adjustment of the fee to ensure that the fee remains a fair and equitable method for the distribution of costs to construct general public facilities necessary to accommodate the public service needs generated by development.

(p) The Comprehensive Impact Fee Study, and future Council-approved amendments and supplements to it and replacements of it, are approved, incorporated here by reference, and provide the technical information and reasoning upon which the fee is based. (Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

(e) Amount of Fee. The amount of the fee shall be established by City Council resolution and may be amended by resolution from time to time to reflect changes in the estimated cost of the facilities to be financed. The method of establishing the fee is that set out in the Comprehensive Impact Fee Study. (Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

Sec. 10-18.304 Exemptions.
No fee is due if a general public facilities fee was previously paid in full for a particular property and use. No fee is due for development by entities which are exempt by law from payment of the fee. There are no other exemptions to this fee. (Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

Article 4. Police Facilities Impact Fee

Sec. 10-18.401 Intent and Purpose.
(a) As a result of increasing regional growth, significant residential, commercial and industrial development is expected to occur within the City.

(b) The Hercules Police Department provides essential and invaluable police services to residents of the City of Hercules and to its entire business and commercial population.

(c) The general plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the City and places limits on the intensity and density of such use. The City Council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the general plan and the rate and amount of actual development of property within the City. Based upon this examination, the City Council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the Council to project, with substantial certainty, the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the City’s general plan.

(d) Based upon projected growth and development permitted under the general plan, a substantial amount of residential, commercial and industrial development will occur in the City before the City is fully built out.

(e) This anticipated development cumulatively will generate a substantial increase in the need for police services and the corresponding capital facilities necessary to provide those services. New development will thus create an additional burden on police services and their existing facilities.

(f) Additions to the existing police protection facilities in the City are needed to mitigate the impacts of development and to accommodate future development. All types of development require and use police and other emergency services.

(g) In order to implement the general plan and to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community, it is necessary that new development pay its pro rata share of its impact upon police services.

(h) The police facilities impact fee is based upon the premise that new development generates additional residents, employees and structures which in turn place an additional burden upon the local police system and facilities and should be expected to pay a share of the new police facilities in accordance with the level of demand generated by that development. The City Council hereby finds:

(1) The purpose of this fee is to provide adequate police protection facilities to serve new development within the City.

(2) The police facilities for which the fee can be used are generally identified in the Comprehensive Impact Fee Study.

(3) Police facilities and related emergency services are needed by all types of development to protect persons and property. The categories of land use for which the fee will be charged are residential, office, retail/service, industrial and hotels.

(4) The amount of the fee shall be established by City Council resolution and shall be based upon the following considerations:

A. New development will pay only for those increases and improvements which serve demands created by new development.

B. Each type of development shall contribute to the needed police protection facilities in proportion to the use of police protection facilities by that type of development.

C. The Comprehensive Impact Fee Study dated February 21, 2001 and prepared by the City of Hercules and Muni Financial and future Council-approved amendments or supplements to it or replacements of it are approved and incorporated by reference. (Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 2001)

Article 5. Fire Facilities Impact Fees

Sec. 10-18.501 Intent and Purpose.
The City Council of the City of Hercules declares:

(a) Adequate fire-fighting facilities are needed to protect the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens and to protect property in the City;

(b) The Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District provides fire protection, fire suppression, rescue, emergency medical aid, hazardous material control and disaster response, and coordination services for the City of Hercules and for the Town of Rodeo;

(c) Although each fire station generally serves a particular geographic area, the stations also serve other areas whenever necessary. The stations are part of an integrated system serving the entire City of Hercules as well as the Town of Rodeo;

(d) The Hercules General Plan includes goals and objectives related to providing adequate fire protection. By including these in the general plan, the City intended to inform residents and developers of City plans for fire services and make fire station locations a part of the land use planning process. The general plan establishes a level of service (LOS) goal for emergency calls. The general plan recommends consideration of a funding mechanism for new facilities. All new development within the City of Hercules is required by law to be consistent with the general plan. The approval of such development must assure that the general plan, and its policies relating to fire facilities, will be implemented.

(e) New development within the City will create an additional burden on existing fire protection facilities;

(f) Additions to existing fire protection facilities in the City are needed to mitigate the impacts of development and to accommodate future development;

(g) All types of development require and use fire and other emergency services;

(h) In order to implement the general plan and to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community, it is necessary that new development pay a fee in lieu of the installation of the necessary improvements to the fire protection system;

(i) Although the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District currently serves both the City of Hercules and the Town of Rodeo, the fire protection facilities to be paid for by the fire facilities fee will be required to serve Hercules even if Rodeo is no longer served.

(j) The fire facilities impact fee is based upon the premise that new development generates additional residents, employees and structures which in turn place an additional burden upon the local fire protection system and should be expected to pay a share of the new fire protection facilities in accordance with the level of demand generated by that development. The City Council hereby finds:

(1) The purpose of this fee is to provide adequate fire protection facilities to serve new development within the City.

(2) The fire protection facilities for which the fee can be used are generally identified in the Comprehensive Impact Fee Study.

(3) Fire protection facilities and related emergency services are needed by all types of development to protect persons and property. The categories of land use for which the fee will be charged are residential, office, retail/service, industrial and hotel.

(4) Based upon the fire department’s records of past responses, all types of development create the need for fire protection and emergency services.

(5) The amount of the fee shall be established by City Council resolution and shall be based upon the following considerations:

A. New development will pay only for those increases and improvements which serve demands created by new development.

B. Each type of development shall contribute to the needed fire protection facilities in proportion to the use of fire protection facilities by that type of development.

Article 6. Transportation Facilities Impact Fees

Sec. 10-18.601 Intent and Purpose.
The City Council of the City of Hercules finds and declares that:

(a) As a result of increasing regional growth, significant residential, commercial and industrial development is expected to occur within the City.

(b) The general plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the City, places limits on the intensity and density of such use, and includes policies to improve the safety of roadway facilities and to provide for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. The City Council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the general plan and the rate and amount of actual development of property within the City. Based upon this examination, the City Council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the council to project, with substantial certainty, the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the City’s general plan.

(c) Based upon projected growth and development permitted under the general plan, a substantial amount of residential, commercial and industrial development will occur in the City before the City is fully built out.

(d) New development in Hercules will increase the demand for all modes of travel (including walking, biking, transit, automobile and truck/goods movement), and thus will increase the need for improvement to transportation facilities, including but not limited to vehicular, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian infrastructure and improvements. This anticipated development cumulatively will generate a substantial increase over existing levels of vehicular traffic, and transit, bicycle and pedestrian travel. This increase in multi-modal travel will result in traffic volumes which exceed the capacity of the existing City-wide circulation system to provide acceptable levels of service and safe transportation facilities. New development within the City will thus create an additional burden on the existing transportation facilities.

(e) If additional traffic-related as well as transit, bicycle, and pedestrian transportation facilities are not added as development occurs, the existing transportation facilities will not be adequate to serve the community consistent with the general plan. This could result in adverse impacts, such unacceptable levels of congestion on streets and at intersections, traffic accidents, air pollution, noise and restricted access for emergency vehicles. This would lead to a deterioration of the level of service for vehicles and deterioration of other transportation facilities, such as transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, which the residents, employees, and property owners in Hercules now enjoy.

(f) To prevent these undesirable consequences, the capacity of the City-wide transportation facilities must be built at a rate which will accommodate the expected growth in the City.

(g) Although the traffic volume generated by an individual development project may not be, in and of itself, sufficient to overload the existing City-wide transportation facilities, the cumulative impact of all new development, including development currently approved or submitted for approval, will result in unacceptable levels of traffic congestion.

(h) It is the policy of the City that new development pay for the cost of improvements to the City-wide circulation system which are necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by new development. In the absence of this Article imposing a traffic facilities fee, existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund a substantial portion of the transportation facilities which are necessary to avoid unacceptable levels of congestion and the related adverse impacts.

(i) All types of urban development require and use transportation facilities. The City Council also has examined the rates at which different land uses generate traffic. The City Council, in evaluating these traffic generation rates, has taken into consideration, among other things, other traffic-related studies and reports prepared by or on behalf of the City. The City Council finds that these traffic generation rates represent a reasonable estimate of the actual impact on the City’s circulation system.

(j) A fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to construct the required improvements to the transportation facilities is to impose a transportation impact fee based on the extent to which new development generates additional traffic volumes and impacts to the transportation facilities.

(k) The 2019 Hercules Transportation Impact Fee Nexus Study specifically identifies transportation facility improvements which are necessary to accommodate future growth. These improvements are and will be incorporated in the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

(l) The circulation system improvements that will be constructed with funds generated pursuant to the article will significantly benefit the contributor in that the adverse impacts, such as noise, air pollution, delay, accidents, increased fuel consumption, harm to the local economy, and inconveniences caused by traffic congestion will be substantially mitigated. Persons who undertake new development in the City are benefited by a desirable community and the City’s reputation for providing, and ability to provide, an adequate transportation system.

(m) Pursuant to Government Code Section 66001, and based upon the 2019 Hercules Transportation Impact Fee Nexus Study and the terms of this Article, the Council finds that:

(1) The purpose of the fee imposed pursuant to this Article is to provide adequate transportation improvements to serve new development within the City.

(2) The improvements for which the fee will be used are identified in the Hercules Transportation Impact Fee Nexus Study, as approved in 2019, summarized below and supported by the Hercules General Plan, to be contained in the City’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP).

(3) All types of urban development require and use the transportation system.

(4) The amount of the fee imposed pursuant to this Article shall bear a fair and reasonable relationship to each development’s burden on and benefit from the City-wide circulation system improvements to be funded by the traffic impact fee, and shall be based on the following considerations:

A. New development will pay only for those improvements which serve new development or which are necessary to reduce impacts to the transportation facilities which would otherwise be created by new development. The cost of improvements needed to alleviate existing transportation system deficiencies are not included in this fee.

B. Each type of development shall contribute to the needed improvements in proportion to the use of improvements by that type of development, based upon traffic generation and trip length characteristics of various land uses to those same rates for a typical single-family residential unit (referred to as a DUE—dwelling unit equivalent) for each type of land use category.

(n) Periodic review, and possible revision, of the resolution adopted by the City Council under this Article will allow for the adjustment of the fee to ensure that the fee remains a fair and equitable method for the distribution of costs to construct circulation system improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by development.

Chapter 19. Inclusionary Housing
Article 1. General Provisions

Sec. 10-19.101 Title.
This Chapter is known and to be cited as the City of Hercules Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.102 Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to:

(a) Enhance the public welfare and assure that further housing development contributes to the attainment of the City’s housing goals by increasing the production of residential units affordable by households of very low, low and moderate income.

(b) Assure that the limited remaining developable land in the City is utilized in a manner consistent with the City’s housing policies and needs. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.103 Definitions.
As used in this Chapter, each of the following terms shall be defined as follows:

(a) “Affordable unit” means an ownership or rental-housing unit, including senior housing, affordable to households with very low, low or moderate incomes as defined in this Chapter.

(1) Rental units are deemed affordable units if the annual rent does not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the maximum income level for very-low, low- or moderate-income households, adjusted for household size and as defined below.

(2) Owner-occupied units are deemed affordable units if the sales price results in annual housing expenses that do not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of income level for very-low, low- and moderate-income households, adjusted for household size and as defined below.

(b) “Applicant” means any person, firm, partnership, association, joint venture, corporation, or any entity or combination of entities that seeks City real property development or approvals.

(c) “Dwelling unit” means a dwelling designed and intended for occupancy by one (1) household.

(d) “Very low, low and moderate income levels” means those income and eligibility levels determined periodically by the California Department of Housing and Community Development based on Contra Costa County median income levels adjusted for family size. Such levels shall be calculated on the basis of gross annual household income considering household size and number of dependents, income of all wage earners, elderly or disabled family members, and all other sources of household income and will be re-certified as set forth by local standards, and state and federal housing law.

(1) “Very low income” means fifty percent (50%) or less of the median income, adjusted for actual household size.

(2) “Low income” means more than fifty percent (50%) to eighty percent (80%) of the median income, adjusted for actual household size.

(3) “Moderate income” means more than eighty percent (80%) to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the median income, adjusted for actual household size.

(e) “Resale controls and/or rent restrictions” means legal restrictions by which the affordable unit shall be restricted to ensure that the unit remains affordable to very-low, low- or moderate-income households, as applicable, for a period of fifty-five (55) years for rental units and forty-five (45) years for owner-occupied units. With respect to rental units, such rent restrictions shall be in the form of a regulatory agreement recorded against the applicable property. With respect to owner-occupied units, such resale control shall be in the form of resale restrictions, deed of trust, and/or other similar documents recorded against the applicable property.

(f) “Residential development” means and includes, without limitation, detached single-family dwellings, multiple-dwelling structures, groups of dwellings, condominium or townhouse developments, condominium conversions, cooperative developments, mixed use development that include housing units, and residential subdivisions intended to be sold to the general public. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.104 General Requirements.
(a) Affordability Requirement. All new residential development projects designed and intended for permanent occupancy shall construct ten percent (10%) of the total number of dwelling units within the development as affordable units, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter. All new development projects designed and intended for permanent occupancy within a redevelopment project area shall construct fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of dwelling units within the development as affordable units; of this fifteen percent (15%) of the units, forty percent (40%) must be affordable to very-low-income households. The foregoing shall be applied no more than once to an approved development (and generally at the tentative map stage), regardless of the changes in the character or ownership of the development, provided the total number of units does not change. In applying and calculating the affordability requirement, any decimal fraction less than 0.50 may be disregarded, and any decimal fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 shall be construed as one (1) unit.

(b) Allocation of Units Outside of Redevelopment Project Area to Income Levels. Affordable units provided, outside of a redevelopment project area, pursuant to this Section shall be allocated to households with very low, low and moderate income levels as follows:

Very-low-income households

20%

Low-income households

20%

Moderate-income households

40%

To meet regional housing need

20%

Where the calculation of all the allocation results in fewer units than would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, one (1) additional unit shall be allocated to the income level with a decimal fraction closer to 0.50.

(c) Conditions of Approval. Any tentative map, conditional use permit, or site development review approving residential development projects subject to this Chapter shall contain conditions sufficient to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. Such conditions shall detail the number of affordable units required, specify the schedule of construction of affordable units, set forth the applicant’s manner of compliance with this Chapter, and require the execution of an agreement imposing appropriate resale controls and/or rental restrictions on the affordable units.

(d) Concurrent Construction. All affordable units in a project or phase of a project shall be constructed concurrently with market-rate units, unless the City Manager determines in writing that extenuating circumstances exist that make concurrent construction infeasible or impractical. If the concurrent construction of the affordable units is found to be infeasible or impractical the developer shall provide the City a performance bond for delivery and construction of the affordable units, which provides for a specific delivery date of the affordable units. The performance bond value, for the total number of affordable units that will be delivered at a later date, shall be determined as indicated in Section 10-19.105(a) (In-lieu Fee).

(e) Design and Distribution of Affordable Units. All affordable units shall reflect the range of numbers of bedrooms provided in the project as a whole and shall not be distinguished by exterior design, construction, or materials. Affordable units may be smaller size than the units in the project and may have fewer amenities than the market-rate units in the project. All affordable units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the project. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.105 Exceptions to Affordability Requirement.
Developers of projects subject to Section 10-19.104(a) of this Chapter shall construct the number of total dwelling units within the development as affordable units, unless subject to an exception set forth in this Section. All exceptions require City Council approval, which shall be obtained at or prior to the last discretionary approval for the project.

(a) Payment of Fees In Lieu of Creation of Affordable Units. Upon request of the applicant, the City Council shall permit the applicant to pay a fee in lieu of constructing up to forty percent (40%) of the affordable units that the developer would otherwise be required to construct pursuant to Section 10-19.104(a) of this Chapter. The amount of the fee shall be as set forth in a resolution of the City Council, which may be amended from time to time to reflect inflation and changed conditions in the City and the region. In-lieu fees shall be paid at the time and in the amount set forth in the in-lieu fee resolution in effect at the time of issuance of the building permit.

(b) Off-Site Projects. An applicant may construct the affordable units not physically within the development in lieu of contracting some or all of the affordable units within the development, with the approval of the City Council, if the City Council finds:

(1) That construction of the units off-site in lieu of constructing units on-site is consistent with the Chapter’s goal of creating, preserving, maintaining, and protecting housing for very-low, low- and moderate-income households.

(2) That the units to be constructed off site are consistent with this Chapter.

(3) That it would be infeasible or impractical to construct affordable units on-site.

(4) That conditions of approval for the project require that the off-site affordable units would be governed by the terms of a deed restriction and, if applicable, rental restrictions similar to that used for the on-site affordable units.

(5) That the conditions of approval for the project, or other security such as a cash deposit, bond, or letter of credit, are adequate to require the construction of the off-site affordable units concurrently with the completion of the construction of the residential development or within a reasonable period (not to exceed two (2) years).

(c) Land Dedication. An applicant may dedicate land to the City or City-designated local non-profit housing developer in lieu of construction of some or all of the required affordable units, if the Council finds:

(1) That dedication of land in lieu of construction units is consistent with the Chapter’s goal of creating, preserving, maintaining, and protecting housing for very-low, low- and moderate-income households.

(2) That the dedicated land is usable for its intended purpose, is free of toxic substances and contaminated soils, and is fully improved, with infrastructure, adjacent utilities, grading and all development impact fees paid excluding any inclusionary zoning ordinance fees.

(3) That the proposed land dedication is of sufficient size to meet the following requirement:

A. The dedication includes land sufficient to construct the number of units that the applicant would otherwise be required to construct, based on the size of lots in the subdivision for which the applicant is meeting its obligation.

(d) Credit Transfers. An applicant may fully or partially satisfy the requirements of Section 10-19.104(a) of this Chapter through the use of transfer credits created pursuant to Section 10-19.107 of this Chapter. Credit certificates shall be presented to the Community Development Director, who shall note at the time of project approval the credit certificate by number. Credit certificates may only be used to satisfy the requirements for inclusionary units for the income category (i.e., very low, low or moderate) and the number of bedrooms for which they were issued. The City may offer credit certificates from historical projects at a value as determined by subsection (a) of this Section.

(e) Waiver Requirements. The City Council, at its discretion, may waive, wholly or partially, the requirements of this Chapter and approve alternate methods of compliance with this Chapter if the applicant demonstrates, and the City Council finds, that such alternate methods meet the purposes of this Chapter. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.106 General Procedures for Implementing Inclusionary Zoning Requirements.
(a) Agreements. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for an affordable unit, resale restrictions or rental controls, or both, as the case may be, shall be set forth in an agreement between the City and the developer, in a form consistent with the City Council-adopted form agreement, which agreement shall be recorded against the property containing the affordable units. The agreement shall be executed by the City Manager, and its requirements shall run with the land and bind the applicant’s successors.

(b) Rental Units; Occupancy; Annual Report. Agreements involving rental units shall require the owner of the affordable units to ensure that the units are occupied by tenants whose monthly income levels do not exceed very low to moderate income levels and shall preclude tenants from subletting or subleasing the unit. The agreement shall also require the owner of the affordable unit to submit an annual report to the City Manager, in a format approved by the City. The report shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: an identification of the affordable units within the project; the monthly rents charged and proposed to be charged; vacancy information for the prior year; and the monthly income for tenants of each affordable unit throughout the prior year.

(c) Ownership Units, Occupancy, City’s Right of First Refusal. Agreements for ownership units shall specify that the inclusionary units must be occupied by the owner or owners and may not be leased or rented without the written approval of the City. The resale restrictions shall provide that in the event of the sale of an affordable unit, the City shall have the right to purchase any affordable owner-occupant unit at the maximum price that could be charged to an eligible household.

(d) Selection Criteria. No household shall be permitted to occupy a unit that is required under this Chapter to be affordable unless the City or its designee has approved the household’s eligibility. Eligible potential occupants of affordable units will be qualified on the basis of household income; the median combined household income statistics for Contra Costa County published periodically by the California Department of Housing and Community Development; all sources of household income and assets; the relationship between household size and the size of available units; and any further criteria required by law. The developer shall use a selection method established by the City’s Affordable Housing Program. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.107 Affordable Unit Credits.
(a) Creation. Affordable unit credits may be created by the City Council. One (1) affordable unit credit certificate shall be issued for each affordable unit constructed in excess of the number of affordable units to be constructed for the project as required by this Chapter. The certificate shall designate a specific income category (i.e., very low, low or moderate income) and number of bedrooms for which they are issued.

(b) Ownership and Use of Credits. Affordable unit credit certificates are issued to and become the possession of the City, who may then use them to satisfy the requirements of this Chapter for another project in the City. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.108 Incentives to Encourage On-Site Construction of Affordable Units.
The City may, but shall not be required to, offer incentives or financial assistance to encourage the on-site construction of affordable units in excess of minimum total number of units in the project to the extent resources for this purpose are available and approved for such use by the City Council or City Manager. Such incentives may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

(a) Fee Deferral.

(1) Development Processing Fees. The City Manager may approve deferred payment of City processing fees applicable to the review and processing of the project. The terms and payment schedule of the deferred fees shall be subject to the approval of the City Manager.

(2) Development Impact Fees. The City Council may authorize the deferred payment of development impact fees applicable to the affordable units. Approval of this incentive requires demonstration by the applicant that the deferral increases the project’s feasibility. The applicant must provide appropriate security to ensure future payment of such fees.

(b) Design Modifications. The City Council may approve design modifications to affordable units that increase the feasibility of the construction of affordable units, including but not limited to, the following:

(1) Reduced lot size;

(2) Reduced setback requirements;

(3) Reduced open space requirements;

(4) Reduced landscaping requirements;

(5) Reduction in interior or exterior amenities;

(6) Reduction in parking requirements;

(7) Height restriction waivers. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.109 Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee Fund.
In-lieu fees shall be deposited into a fund known as the “Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fees Fund” (“Fund”).

(a) Use. All monies in the fund, together with any interest earnings on such monies less reasonable administrative charges, shall be used or committed to use by the City for the purpose of providing very-low, low- and moderate-income ownership or rental housing in the City of Hercules.

(b) Annual Report. The City Manager shall prepare an annual report to the City Council identifying the balance of monies in the Fund and the affordable units provided and any monies committed to providing very-low, low- and moderate-income housing. The annual report shall also include a review of administrative charges. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.110 Violations.

Any person convicted of an infraction under the provisions of this Code shall be punishable as provided by the Government Code of the State of California. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.111 Enforcement.
(a) General. The City Manager shall enforce this Chapter, and its provisions shall be binding on all agents, successors, and assigns of an applicant. The City Manager may suspend or revoke any building permit or approval upon finding a violation of any provision of this Chapter. No land-use approval, building permit, or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any residential development unless exempt from or in compliance with this Chapter. The City may institute any appropriate legal actions or proceedings necessary to ensure compliance herewith, including, but not limited to, actions to revoke, deny, or suspend any permit or development approval.

(b) Excessive Rents/Legal Action. If the City Manager determines that rents in excess of those allowed by operation of this Chapter have been charged to a tenant residing in an affordable unit, the City may take appropriate legal action to recover, and the project owner shall be obligated to pay to the tenant, or to the City in the event the tenant cannot be located, any excess rents charged. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Sec. 10-19.112 Appeals.
Decisions of the City Manager under this Chapter may be appealed as provided in this Municipal Code. (Ord. 469 § 3 (part), 2012: Ord. 416 § 3 (part), 2006)

Chapter 20. Central Hercules Plan Regulating Code*
*    Editor’s Note: The Central Hercules Plan Regulating Code, added as Chapter 18 of this title by Ordinance 367, was editorially renumbered to avoid duplication. A copy of the Central Hercules Plan Regulating Code is available in the City Clerk’s office.

Chapter 21. Art in Public Places Program*
*    Code reviser’s note: This Chapter, added as Chapter 20 of this title by Ordinance 456, was editorially renumbered to avoid duplication.

Sec. 10-21.101 Title.
This Chapter is known and to be cited as “the City of Hercules Art in Public Places Program Ordinance.” (Ord. 456 § 1 (part), 2010)

Sec. 10-21.102 Purpose.
The City Council hereby finds and declares:

(a) Artwork enhances the quality of life for individuals living in, working in, and visiting the City.

(b) Balanced development of artistic resources preserves and improves the quality of the urban environment and increases real property values.

(c) As development and revitalization of the real property within the City continue, the opportunities for creating cultural and artistic resources diminish. Simultaneously, development and revitalization will urbanize the community, increasing the need for cultural and artistic outlets to improve the environment, image, and character of the community.

(d) Development of cultural and artistic assets should be financed by those whose development and revitalization diminish the availability of the community’s resources for those opportunities and contribute to community urbanization.

(e) Establishment of this Art in Public Places Program (APPP) will promote the general welfare by providing cultural and artistic resources matched with the community’s physical growth and revitalization.

Therefore, as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter, the City shall require that certain City-sponsored developments and certain private developments use a portion of building development funds for the acquisition of freely accessible works of art for placement on the development site or elsewhere in the City as a condition of project approval. (Ord. 456 § 1 (part), 2010)

Sec. 10-21.103 Definitions.
For purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) “Artwork” means original creations of art, including, but not limited to, the following categories: sculpture, murals, mosaics, fountains, and paving designs. These categories may be realized through such media as steel, bronze, stained glass, concrete, wood, ceramic tile and stone, as well as other suitable materials.

(b) “Building development costs” shall mean those construction costs as declared on all building permit applications, and as accepted by the Building Official, but shall not apply to costs solely attributable to tenant improvements. Building permit applications shall include, but not be limited to, all building, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical permit applications for the project.

(c) “Freely available” shall mean that artwork is accessible to the public for viewing, in a direct line of sight, for a period of no less than ten (10) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, with the option of excluding national holidays.

(d) “Art in Public Places contribution” shall equal the percentage of building development costs required herein, or as set by resolution of the City Council. (Ord. 456 § 1 (part), 2010)

Sec. 10-21.104 Contribution Requirements.
(a) Private Developments. Private developments that require a building permit shall devote to the Art in Public Places Program an amount not less than one percent (1%) of building development costs, provided the development is either a:

(1) Nonresidential or live-work building development with building development costs in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000); or

(2) Residential-only building development of five (5) or more units with building development costs in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).

At least forty percent (40%) of the Art in Public Places contribution must be deposited into the Hercules Art in Public Places Fund. Up to sixty percent (60%) of the Art in Public Places contribution may be spent, at the developer’s discretion but subject to City Council approval, on on-site artwork. If the developer does not choose to implement on-site artwork, the full obligation shall be allocated to the Hercules Art in Public Places Fund.

Contributions of funds or other involvement with the Redevelopment Agency shall not necessarily change the characterization of the project as a private development.

(b) Public Developments. For public building developments by the City of Hercules or Redevelopment Agency, with building development costs in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and that require a building permit, the City or Redevelopment Agency shall expend an amount not less than one percent (1%) of such costs for freely accessible art on the development site.

(c) Exceptions. The requirements of this Chapter shall not apply to projects and activities related to remodeling, repair, or reconstruction of structures that have been damaged by fire, flood, wind, earthquake, or other calamity.

The City Council may, by resolution, authorize exemptions from this Chapter for projects for which compliance would be unfeasible, cause undue hardship, or not be in the public interest. (Ord. 456 § 1 (part), 2010)

Sec. 10-21.105 Hercules Art in Public Places Fund.
(a) Establishment of Fund. There is hereby created a Hercules Art in Public Places Fund. All funds deposited into the Art in Public Places Fund shall be expended only for implementation of the Art in Public Places Program, including acquiring, placing, and maintaining freely available artwork throughout the City.

(b) Use of Fund. Expenditures of the fees collected in the Art in Public Places Fund may include the following:

(1) The cost of artwork, including its design, acquisition, commission, improvement, and installation;

Upon approval of the City Council, the City may sell or exchange artwork that has been purchased with moneys from the Art in Public Places Fund or donated to the City for replacement artwork. Any funds obtained from the sale of artwork shall be deposited to the Art in Public Places Fund. Artwork owned privately and on display by agreement may be exchanged with City Council approval. Any artwork installed pursuant to this Chapter may be replaced, provided all of the following requirements are met:

(1) The cost of the replacement shall be equal to, or greater than, the cost of the artwork to be removed;

(2) The location of the replacement shall be freely accessible;

(3) The replacement shall conform in every respect to all applicable standards adopted by the City Council;

(4) The replacement work, location, and installation shall not violate any other law, rule, regulation, policy, or ordinance.

Sec. 10-21.106 Implementation of the Art in Public Places Program.
(a) Guidelines. Guidelines and limitations for implementing the Public Art Program shall be approved by the City Council.

The sum of the deposit and (if applicable) the valuation of the on-site artwork (as validated by the City Council) shall be equal to, or greater than, the Art in Public Places contribution required by Section 10-21.104. The owner or developer shall provide the City with proof of installation of any requested artwork on the development site and proof of full payment of the required Art in Public Places contribution before issuance of the certificate of occupancy, unless the City has approved some other method of assuring compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.

Chapter 13-1. Title, Components and Purposes
Sec. 13-1.100 Title and Enactment.
This Title shall be known as the “City of Hercules Zoning Ordinance” hereinafter known as the “Zoning Ordinance.” [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 1.100.]

Sec. 13-1.200 Components.
The Zoning Ordinance is composed of the following components:

1. Regulations, known as the zoning regulations, establishing classes of zoning districts governing the use and development of land, placement and sizing of structures and improvements, and procedures for development application, review and appeal.

2. A map or set of maps, known as the Zoning Map, which delineates boundaries of zoning districts within the City of Hercules.

A copy of the zoning regulations and map together with a record of all adopted amendments shall be kept on file with the City Clerk and shall constitute the original record of the Zoning Ordinance. A copy of the zoning regulations and map shall also be kept on file with the Community Development Director. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 1.200.]

Sec. 13-1.300 Purpose.
The overall purpose of the Zoning Ordinance is to promote the public health, safety and welfare and general prosperity with the aim of preserving a wholesome, serviceable and attractive community. More specifically, the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance is to:

1. Preserve and enhance the community’s quality of life with well-balanced growth and development.

2. Enhance and create a community with a wide range of choices, services, and amenities.

3. Accommodate expansion of development into vacant or underdeveloped lands and lands subject to redevelopment.

4. Provide a set of regulations and procedures to review and process land use and development applications in an open, fair and equitable manner.

5. Facilitate attractive, functional and safe development within the City for a variety of uses, which may at times be combined on a site.

6. Minimize adverse environmental effects and fiscal consequences to the community. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 1.300.]

Sec. 13-1.400 Authority and General Plan Consistency—Organization.
The Zoning Ordinance is the primary tool for implementing the goals, objectives, policies and standards of the Hercules General Plan, pursuant to the mandated provisions of the State Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Section 65000 et seq.) and other applicable State and local requirements.

The land use zoning districts contained within the Zoning Ordinance are consistent with and implement the land use designations of the General Plan as shown in Section 13-5.200. Overlay districts follow the adopted Land Use Map and the policies and standards of the General Plan related to these overlay regulations. In addition, the purposes, performance standards and development regulations of the zoning and overlay districts incorporate General Plan policies and standards to implement the General Plan and require that all development within the boundaries of the City be consistent with the General Plan. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 1.400.]

Chapter 13-2. Organization, Applicability and Interpretation

The process of reviewing zoning permits and administering the Zoning Ordinance is contained within Division IV. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 2.100.]

Sec. 13-2.200 Applicability of Zoning Ordinance.
The Zoning Ordinance shall apply to all property, whether owned by private persons, firms, corporations or organizations, the United States of America or any of its agencies, the State of California or any of its agencies or political subdivisions, any city or county, including the City of Hercules or any of its agencies, or any authority or district organized under the laws of the State of California. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 2.200.]

Sec. 13-2.300 Administration of Zoning Ordinance.

Sec. 13-2.400 Rules for Interpretation.
1. The provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall be interpreted as setting forth standards and procedures for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the City of Hercules. The Zoning Ordinance implements the General Plan. The General Plan shall have precedence in the event that any conflict between the 2 documents should arise. Where conflicts occur between the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and the Building Code or other regulations of the City, the more restrictive shall apply. Where conflicts occur between the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the most recently adopted shall apply; if the provisions were adopted on the same date, the most restrictive shall apply. Where uncertainty exists regarding the interpretation of any provision of the Zoning Ordinance or its application to a particular site or situation, the Community Development Director shall determine the intent and application of the provision.

2. Whenever any uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown upon the official Zoning Map the following provisions shall apply:

A. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets, alleys, lot lines, or flood control channels, such lines shall be interpreted to be such boundaries.

B. In the case of unsubdivided property or where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless indicated by dimensions or legal descriptions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Zoning Map.

C. Where further uncertainty exists, the Community Development Director shall determine the location of the boundary in question, giving due consideration to the location indicated on the Zoning Map and the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and the purposes set forth in the district regulations.

3. In addition to the provisions of the Municipal Code, the following rules shall apply to interpreting the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance:

A. The following conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows unless the context of the language clearly indicates a contrary interpretation.

1) “And” indicates that all connected words, phrases or provisions shall apply.

2) “Or” indicates that the connected words, phrases or provisions apply singly or may apply in combination depending on the context.

3) “Either ... or” indicates that the connected words, phrases or provisions shall apply singly but not in combination.

B. When a conflict arises between the regulations of different zoning districts, overlays, development standards, performance standards or other provisions, the following shall apply; provided, that such interpretation is not contrary to the objectives and policies of the General Plan.

1) Any guidance for priority within the regulations in question such as “the most recently amended regulation shall prevail” shall receive first preference in resolving an apparent conflict.

2) The more restrictive requirement shall receive second preference.

3) District specific standards shall receive preference over Citywide standards as a third preference.

C. If there is a conflict between the text and a diagram or figure, the text shall prevail.

D. All references to days are calendar days unless otherwise indicated. If a time deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline shall be extended to the next working day of the City.

4. An interpretation of the zoning regulations or provisions and zoning district boundaries by the Community Development Director may be appealed to the Planning Commission and City Council as provided in Chapter 13-44. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 2.400.]

Sec. 13-2.500 Severability.
If any Division, Chapter, Section, sentence, clause, phrase, figure or table of the Zoning Ordinance is declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remaining portions of the Zoning Ordinance shall not be affected. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 2.500.]

Chapter 13-5. Application of Zone District Regulations
Sec. 13-5.100 Purpose.

2. Regulate and limit the height, size, density and placement of buildings and other structures,

3. Regulate and determine the size and extent of setbacks and yards, landscaped areas and usable open spaces associated with a development or use.

4. Facilitate adequate provisions for community infrastructure such as transportation, water, sewage, drainage, parks, schools, open spaces and other public requirements.

5. Lessen congestion on streets and provide for alternative means of transportation such as transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

[Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.200.]

Sec. 13-5.210 Zoning Maps.
The Zoning Map is hereby made a part of this Title. The “Zoning Map” of the City of Hercules as adopted and attached sets forth the location of all zone districts within the City. All property within the City is placed in zone districts as indicated on the Zoning Map, and no property shall be used except in accordance with zoning designations on the Zoning Map and the provisions of this Title. Overlay districts are at times designated on the Zoning Map or are located by definition within the text, or may be applied upon approval of an application.

All zone changes and amendments to the Zoning Map as set forth in Chapter 13-52 shall be noted on the map with the date of the zone change or amendment and reference to the implementing ordinance. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.210.]

Sec. 13-5.220 Vacation of Public Street or Alley.
Where a public street or alley or any portion of the same is officially abandoned, the area comprising such vacated street shall acquire the zoning district classification of the adjacent property to which it reverts. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.220.]

Sec. 13-5.300 Allowable Land Uses.
Allowable land uses within a zoning district are classified by general land uses rather than extensive lists of specific land uses. The zoning district land use regulations table lists general land uses and uses common to it that may be appropriate as permitted or conditional uses within the zoning district. In most cases, permitted uses will require an administrative use permit as designated within the land use regulations table. In addition, prohibited uses may be identified where such uses may be appropriate within a broad land use category, but are inappropriate for a specific zoning district in the context of the specific purposes of the district and its allowed uses.

The conformance and appropriateness of a specifically proposed use shall be determined by the Community Development Director. When a use is not specifically listed in a classification, the use may be permitted if the Community Development Director determines that the use is similar to others listed in a classification.

In determining conformity, appropriateness and similarity, the Community Development Director shall use the following standards:

1. The proposed use meets the intent of and is consistent with the General Plan description of the land use classification; and is consistent with General Plan goals, objectives, policies and standards.

2. The proposed use meets the stated purpose and general intent of the zoning district in which it is proposed.

3. The proposed use is consistent with or shares common characteristics with and is not of greater intensity or density and will not generate greater environmental impact than uses listed in the zoning district in which it is proposed.

4. The proposed use meets specific standards for similar uses allowed within a zoning district.

5. The proposed use can meet the performance standards for the zoning district along with the general performance standards of the City set forth in Chapter 13-31.

6. The proposed use does not adversely affect the public health, safety or general welfare of the community nor constitute a public nuisance.

The Community Development Director may determine that a specific use does not meet conformance and appropriateness standards, whether or not named within the uses of a zoning district, if its characteristics are substantially incompatible or impacts substantially greater than the uses typical to the zoning district. An appeal of the decision of the Community Development Director may be made to the Planning Commission and City Council as per Chapter 13-44. An appeal of a decision regarding allowable uses must be made in writing within 10 working days of the decision. In reviewing an appeal, the Planning Commission and City Council shall use the criteria set forth in this Section.

Any new use, or any use that cannot be clearly determined to be in an existing use classification, may be incorporated into the zoning regulations by a Zoning Ordinance text amendment if approved by City Council as provided in Chapter 13-51. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.300.]

Sec. 13-5.310 Addition of Allowed Uses.
Upon application or on its own initiative, the Council may add a use to the list of permitted uses prescribed within each zoning district if the Council makes the following findings:

1. That the use will be an appropriate addition to the list of permitted uses because the use has the same basic characteristics as the uses permitted in the district.

2. That the use reasonably can be expected to conform with the required conditions prescribed for the district.

3. That the use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare.

4. That the use will not adversely affect the land use character of any district in which it is proposed to be permitted.

5. That the use will not create more vehicular or rail traffic than the volume normally created by any of the uses permitted in the district.

6. That the use will not create more odor, dust, dirt, smoke, noise, vibration, illumination, glare, unsightliness or any other objectionable influence than the amount normally created by any of the uses permitted in the district.

7. That the use will not create any greater hazard of fire or explosion than the hazards normally created by any of the uses permitted in the district.

When a use has been added to a list of permitted uses in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this Section, the use shall be deemed to be listed as a permitted use in the appropriate Section and shall be added to the text of that Section of this Title when it is next published with the notation of the date when the use was added to the list. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.310.]

Sec. 13-5.320 Conformity with District Regulations.
No site or structure shall be used or designated for uses for any purpose or in any manner other than in conformity with the regulations for the district in which the site or structure is located, or, in the case of a planned development, in conformity with the regulations prescribed in Chapter 13-48. No structure shall be erected and no existing structure or use shall be moved, altered or enlarged except in conformity with the regulations for the district in which the structure or use is located, or, in the case of a planned development, in conformity with the regulations prescribed in Chapter 13-48. No yard or other open space surrounding any structure or use shall be used, encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the regulations for the district in which the yard or open space is located, or, in the case of a planned development, in conformity with the regulations prescribed in Chapter 13-48. No site held in 1 ownership at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this Title or at any time thereafter shall be reduced in any manner below the minimum area, frontage, width or depth prescribed for the district in which the site is located. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.320.]

Sec. 13-5.330 Use of Nonconforming Sites.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, a site shown on a duly approved and recorded subdivision map or for which a deed or valid contract of sale was recorded prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this Title and which had a legal area, frontage, width and depth at the time that the subdivision map, deed or contract of sale was recorded, but which now has an area, frontage, width or depth less than the minimum prescribed for the zoning district of the site may be used for any permitted use. However, such a site shall be subject to all other regulations for the district in which the site is located, or, in the case of a planned development, in conformity with the regulations prescribed in Chapter 13-48. Two or more adjoining vacant sites, which are in the same ownership as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this Title or subsequent thereto, with continuous frontage and each having an area, width or frontage less than the minimum prescribed for the zoning district of the sites shall be subject to all regulations for their zoning district(s) including minimum area, width and frontage requirements, as if the sites constituted a single parcel of real property. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.330.]

Sec. 13-5.340 Accessory Uses.
Uses and structures that are subordinate and incidental to the principal use or structure on a site. The range of uses and structures allowed as accessory uses are identified in Section 13-60.200, Definitions. Accessory structures may require an administrative use permit and may have conditions limiting use as determined by the land use regulations for each zoning district. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.340.]

Sec. 13-5.350 Temporary Uses.
Temporary uses and structures are of limited duration. Examples of temporary uses regulated by the Zoning Ordinance include animal shows, Christmas tree sales, circuses and carnivals, commercial video/filming and production, outdoor retail sales, farmers markets, personal property sales, religious assembly on a temporary site, signage, street fairs, nonrecurring swap meets and flea markets, and trade fairs. Administrative use permits are required in all cases. Nonrecurring garage sales of personal property within residentially zoned and developed areas are exempt from use permit requirements as are City sponsored or public events on City property, school sponsored events on school property and church sponsored events on church property. Nonrecurring shall mean events that are limited in duration to 48 hours and are conducted by a sponsor no more than 3 times in a calendar year. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.350.]

Sec. 13-5.400 Regulation of Property Development Standards.
Property development standards are set forth in each zoning district and some overlay districts. Property development standards regulate the development of structures within a property including site area, unit and floor area density, lot size, lot dimensions, setbacks and yards, site coverage, usable open space, height, and references to parking, signage, refuse storage areas, mechanical equipment screening and nonconforming structures. In most cases the standards identify a minimum and/or maximum requirement.

Densities are usually identified as gross densities with a minimum and maximum range with a typical density. The goal of the typical density is to achieve an overall growth target set by the City in its General Plan. However, the density of a property is allowed to vary within the range according to factors such as topography, economic, neighborhood compatibility, provision of affordable housing, market conditions and the capability of a proposed development to further specific goals, policies and standards of the General Plan.

In some cases, property development regulations may vary or be determined through the approval of a planned development plan, Chapter 13-48. In these cases, the property regulations adopted as part of the planned development plan would determine the standards for property development from that point until the planned development plan is rescinded, expires or is amended. Further definition and application of property development standards are presented in Chapter 13-30. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.400.]

Sec. 13-5.500 Review of Plans and General Conditions.
Plan review requirements and general application conditions are specified for each zoning district. Applications for administrative or conditional use permits are required for most uses and the development of most structures. In addition there may be application conditions specific to a zoning district that must be met before an application is complete. These conditions may include design review and additional studies and plans, planned development applications, etc. The applications and plans submitted for a development or use also need to address general and specific performance standards. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.500.]

Sec. 13-5.600 Development and Performance Standards.
General development and performance standards for development within the City are identified in Division III. In addition, specific performance standards for a zoning district may be required as identified within the performance standards section of each zoning district. All allowed uses are to meet the required performance standards. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 5.600.]

Sec. 13-5.700 Zoning Clearance Procedure.
Zoning clearance shall be implemented through use permit application, development plan and design review. The primary goal of the administrative use permit is to provide a review and recordkeeping mechanism for development and uses within the City in addition to setting forth time periods and minor conditions of approval. Where a particular kind of development does not require a use permit of any kind such as limited accessory structures in some districts, zoning clearance will be met through review of any required building or paving permits. All building permits will be reviewed by the Community Development Director or Chief Building Official to verify that appropriate property regulations, performance standards and conditions of approval are met. A certificate of occupancy is not to be issued until such verification is recorded following the final building permit site inspection. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 511 § 3, 2018; ZO § 5.700.]

Chapter 13-6. Residential Districts
Sec. 13-6.100 Specific Purposes.
1. In addition to the general purposes listed in Section 13-5.100, the specific purposes of the residential districts are to:

A. Reserve appropriately located areas for family living at a reasonable range of population densities consistent with the General Plan and sound standards of public health and safety.

B. Ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and yard/open space for each dwelling unit and protect residents from public safety hazards and other harmful environmental effects.

C. Preserve as many of the desirable characteristics of single-family residential districts as possible while allowing for associated residential uses such as daycare, rooming and boarding, home occupations, second residential units to the extent that substantial adverse impacts are not caused to adjacent residences.

D. Promote safe and well-designed neighborhoods and encourage new residential development to have an internal circulation system, including pedestrian walkways, bikeways, and access to transit facilities. Ensure provision of public services and facilities to support existing and planned residential densities.

E. Reserve appropriate areas for multifamily dwellings that may be located and designed to be compatible with adjacent land uses and residences.

F. Encourage development of innovative types of housing, including co-housing, congregate care facilities, and other types of housing that may provide low cost alternatives to typical market-rate housing.

G. Encourage provision of affordable housing units, especially for single persons, single parents, elderly and young families. Provide well-designed, well-built housing units for low- and moderate-income households in mixed-density developments, including planned developments (PDs), avoiding a concentration in any limited area.

H. Provide additional affordable senior citizen housing. Encourage provision of senior housing by considering density bonuses up to General Plan maximum where senior projects are desirable and compatible with special senior needs.

I. Allow for public and quasi-public land uses to complement residential development within close access such as schools, churches and daycare facilities; provided, that substantial adverse impacts such as traffic congestion, increased noise (ambient or episodic) or full use of available on-street parking, or other similar impacts are not caused on nearby residences.

2. The additional purposes of each residential zoning district are:

A. RS-E Residential Single-Family Estate. To provide sites for estate homes on larger lots to be developed with custom built and individually designed homes with a gross density of 1 or 2 units per acre and a minimum parcel size of one-half acre. Specific densities are assigned on the Zoning Map.

B. RS-L Residential Single-Family Low Density. To provide areas for single-family housing on smaller lots that will generally be developed as part of a larger planned subdivision where a limited number of models of varied exterior designs are built in a random pattern on individual lots with a gross density of 2 to 7 units per acre and a minimum parcel size of 6,000 square feet unless a smaller lot size is allowed by an approved planned development (PD).

C. RM-L Residential Multifamily Low Density. To provide sites for low density multifamily housing such as townhouses, condominiums and apartments, and medium density single-family housing that incorporate good design and amenities with a gross density up to 12 units per acre (midrange density of 9 units per acre). The minimum parcel size for multifamily housing is 3 acres. The minimum lot size for single-family housing is 4,000 square feet unless a smaller lot size is allowed by an approved planned development (PD).

D. RM-M Residential Multifamily Medium Density. To provide sites for medium density multifamily housing such as townhouses, condominiums and apartments that incorporate good design and amenities with a gross density of 12 to 30 units per acre (midrange density of 20 units per acre) and a minimum parcel size of 5 acres.

E. RM-H Residential Multifamily High Density. To provide sites for high density multifamily housing, typically located near public transit centers, adequate streets, shopping centers or other high activity areas and that incorporate good design and amenities with a gross density of 30 to 55 units per acre (midrange density of 42 units per acre) and a minimum parcel size of 15 acres. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 6.100.]

Sec. 13-6.200 Review of Plans and General Conditions.
Plans for all new and expanded development and uses shall be submitted to the Community Development Director as per Section 13-40.300. The following general conditions shall apply to all areas designated for residential use within this Chapter.

1. All new and expanded residential development shall apply for an administrative or conditional use permit. Administrative use permit review of new single-family homes, additions and remodels shall be limited to conformance with development regulations specified or referenced within this Chapter.

2. All new and expanded development except for additions and remodels shall also be subject to Chapter 13-42, Design Review.

3. Major residential subdivisions and multifamily projects of 10 units or more shall require a planned development plan as per Chapter 13-48. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 6.200.]

Sec. 13-6.300 Performance Standards.
The standard performance standards for development specified in Chapter 13-31 shall be met. In addition, the following specific performance standards shall be met:

1. Residential streets shall be designed in relation to the needed capacity and the adjoining housing patterns while discouraging through traffic on local streets.

2. Existing residential structures of architectural or historic significance are to be restored and maintained.

3. New residential areas shall be designed to avoid conflict with major streets or thoroughfares, and should provide access to transit facilities to encourage safe and convenient alternatives to the private auto.

4. Multifamily residential land shall be developed with a balance of open space, landscaping, and recreational amenities and should be easily accessible to commercial and recreational areas and public transportation.

5. Upon reinstitution of the inclusionary housing ordinance, new residential development shall include a minimum 10 percent of the total number of units for affordable housing. No in-lieu fees will be accepted by the City unless the developer can establish extraordinary circumstances for not providing affordable housing or unless an agreement predating the adoption of the 1996 General Plan Amendment provides otherwise.

A density bonus up to 35 percent over the maximum General Plan designation may be provided, along with the waiver of fees and the relaxation of development standards, in exchange for low income or senior housing provided, as per Section 65915 of the California Government Code and Sections 13-30.420 through 13-30.470 (Residential Density Bonus). In order to encourage the development of lower income housing units, the waiver of fees and the relaxation of development standards may be considered by the City in return for commitments to provide lower income housing.

6. Affordable senior housing projects with density bonuses up to General Plan maximum are allowed where desirable and compatible with special senior needs. Such projects shall only be allowed where the size of the structure and style of architecture are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.

7. The use of solar systems, both active and passive designs, is encouraged in new residential development. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 484 § 13, 2015; ZO § 6.300.]

Sec. 13-6.400 Land Use Regulations.
All new and expanded development and uses that are allowed in the residential zoning districts are identified in Table 13-6.1. The following uses may be permitted in the designated residential zoning districts subject to compliance with Chapter 13-49 and approval by the Community Development Director. Use permits, administrative or conditional, are required for all new and expanded residential development.

Single story detached accessory structures under 8 feet tall and 120 square feet total area for the site are exempt from use permit requirements in the (RS-E, RS-L and RM-L) districts. Minor utilities such as public street lighting and traffic signals, electrical distribution lines, telephone lines, cable lines, and underground water, sewer and drainage mains and pipes that are necessary to support legally established uses are exempt from use permit requirements in all residential districts. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 6.400.]

Sec. 13-6.500 Property Development Regulations.

Chapter 13-8. Commercial Districts
Sec. 13-8.100 Specific Purposes.
1. In addition to the general purposes listed in Section 13-5.100, the specific purposes of the commercial districts are to:

A. Reserve appropriately located areas for a full range of retail commercial, service commercial and professional and administrative offices consistent with the General Plan.

B. Provide an opportunity for retail stores and offices to concentrate for the convenience of the public in a mutually beneficial relationship to each other and to provide commodities and services that will meet the needs of the community and neighborhood areas they serve.

C. Give favorable consideration to new retail development that would generate substantial new sales, for businesses that would provide substantial employment, high growth technical businesses (particularly bio-tech, flex office and incubator uses), health care services, restaurants and innovative mixed-use development proposals. Encourage uses that bring additional revenues (retail sales, property tax) either directly or indirectly to the City.

D. Create a strong and successful focus or center for business and activities that would provide services, shopping opportunities which would attract employees, clients, and patrons from a regional area, while not disturbing existing residential and community oriented areas. Where appropriate, allow limited commercial uses in residential areas to promote access to services.

E. Encourage local and regional commercial uses that can benefit from substantial regional traffic on I-80, SR-4, and San Pablo Avenue.

F. Promote development of a regional commercial recreation center or complex.

G. Expand the range of recreational activities and opportunities available in the community and allow for a mix of private commercial and public/semi-public recreation and support uses that contribute to a full service recreational facility within a property or project.

H. Provide sites for public and quasi-public uses needed to complement commercial development.

2. The additional purposes of each commercial zoning district are:

A. CG General Commercial. To permit a wide variety of commercial uses that will attract clientele from both Hercules and adjacent communities as well as those using I-80 and Highway 4. The character of the buildings will typically be suburban in nature and 1 to 2 stories in height, with a FAR of 0.20 to 1.00 (typical FAR of 0.30). Higher height may be allowed; provided, that such height conforms to the overall character of the development and does not adversely impact surrounding development.

B. CC Community Commercial. To accommodate commercial development including retail, office, and service uses that serve residents and employees within the City with a FAR of 0.20 to 1.00 (typical FAR of 0.25). Generally, the location of these areas lack direct access and visibility from regional routes, effectively excluding businesses that require patronage from a regional market.

C. CR Recreational Commercial. To allow properties to be developed and used for recreational activities that are conducted as a business with a FAR of 0.20 to 0.40 (typical FAR of 0.25). Recreational Commercial sites can vary widely in size according to use, from less than 1 acre (batting cages) to more than 100 acres (golf course). However, the site is to be of sufficient size to accommodate the recreational facilities and activities without impacting surrounding properties. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 8.100.]

Sec. 13-8.200 Review of Plans and General Conditions.
Plans for all new and expanded development and uses shall be submitted to the Community Development Director as per Section 13-40.300. The following general conditions shall apply to all areas designated for commercial use within this Chapter.

1. All new and expanded commercial development shall apply for an administrative or conditional use permit and shall be subject to Chapter 13-42, Design Review.

2. General Commercial and Community Commercial projects of 10 acres or more and all Recreational Commercial projects shall require a planned development plan as per Chapter 13-48.

3. A lighting and fencing plan is to be prepared as part of the planned development plan for Recreational Commercial projects to minimize night lighting and recreational activity impacts on adjacent properties, especially those with residential uses.

4. New and expanded recreational commercial facilities and activities that are expected to generate significant noise levels shall have a noise management plan approved as part of the planned development plan or the use permit. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 8.200.]

Sec. 13-8.300 Performance Standards.
The standard performance standards for development specified in Chapter 13-31 shall be met. In addition, the following specific performance standards shall be met:

1. The planning and development of commercial areas shall minimize the effects on existing residential areas.

2. Provide pathways and bicycle racks or storage facilities to encourage pedestrian and bicycle travel for home to work and home to local shopping trips.

3. Adequate fencing is to be provided and maintained to reasonably contain recreational activities and equipment within the property.

4. Noise from recreational activities and equipment should be controlled through facility design and operations to meet community noise standards, especially in areas with adjacent residential uses. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 8.300.]

Sec. 13-8.400 Land Use Regulations.
All new and expanded development and uses that are allowed in the commercial zoning districts are identified in Table 13-8.1. The following uses may be permitted in the designated commercial zoning districts subject to compliance with Chapter 13-49 and approval by the Community Development Director. Use permits, administrative or conditional, are required for all new and expanded commercial development. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 8.400.]

Sec. 13-8.500 Property Development Regulations.
The property development regulations presented in Table 13-8.2 establish basic site and design requirements for commercial zoning districts. All regulation standards are minimum amounts unless otherwise stated.

A. Reserve appropriately located areas for heavy and light industrial uses consistent with the General Plan and the character of Hercules.

B. Provide an opportunity for industrial uses to concentrate for the efficiency of larger industries and to allow for buffers from sensitive residential and public uses in a manner that does not expose residents to significant environmental risk.

C. Strengthen the City’s economic base and provide for economic diversity, employment and an adequate daytime population within the City.

D. Allow for new light industrial uses related to evolving technologies, research and development, communications, and information processing.

2. The additional purposes of the industrial zoning district are:

A. I Industrial. To permit a limited range of heavy industry that is associated with historic heavy industrial uses with the City and to permit a variety of light industrial uses with emphasis on encouraging uses and facilities related to the development, production, and support of evolving technologies. New industrial development is typically to be 1 to 2 stories in height, with a FAR of 0.30 to 0.50 (typical FAR of 0.40). [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 9.100.]

Sec. 13-9.200 Review of Plans and General Conditions.
Plans for all new and expanded development and uses shall be submitted to the Community Development Director as per Section 13-40.300. The following general conditions shall apply to all areas designated for industrial use within this Chapter.

1. All new, expanded and relocated industrial development shall apply for an administrative or conditional use permit, and shall be subject to Chapter 13-42, Design Review.

2. Industrial projects of 10 acres or more shall require a planned development plan as per Chapter 13-48. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 9.200.]

2. New industrial uses that may reasonably be expected to generate substantial odor, dust, noise, vibration, water quality, air quality, public safety, or toxic and hazardous material impacts are prohibited. Existing heavy industrial uses that generate such impacts shall be required to reduce impact levels as a condition for expansion, relocation or change of use.

3. A hazardous materials management plan to regulate use of hazardous materials within the facility and to provide for the storage and disposal of small amounts of hazardous wastes that may be generated is to be prepared and submitted as part of the use permit application. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 9.300.]

Sec. 13-9.400 Land Use Regulations.
All new and expanded development and uses that are allowed in the industrial zoning district are identified in Table 13-9.1. These uses may be permitted in the industrial zoning district subject to compliance with Chapter 13-49 and approval by the Community Development Director. The industrial use classifications use very general categories which may allow a wide variety of heavy, light, and R&D industrial uses subject to the ability to meet industrial and citywide performance standards. Use permits, administrative or conditional, are required for all new and expanded industrial development. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 9.400.]

Sec. 13-9.500 Property Development Regulations.

G. Designate and preserve public open spaces and open space areas dedicated through the development of existing and future projects.

H. Promote the development of a low- and moderate-income senior apartment project on a City-owned site.

2. The additional purposes of the public/quasi-public zoning districts are:

A. P/QP-C Public/Quasi-Public—City. To permit an appropriate range of local governmental and quasi-public land uses and services within the City. City of Hercules governmental offices, public safety facilities and infrastructure/utility facilities are expected to be the main uses. Senior housing may also be allowed on an appropriate publicly owned site. New development is typically to be 1 to 2 stories in height, with a FAR of 0.30 to 1.00 (typical FAR of 0.40).

B. P/QP-O Public/Quasi-Public—Open Space. To designate and preserve public open spaces within the City. Most of these open spaces are dedicated to open space use as a result of past residential development. This designation is also appropriate for future open space dedications within the hills, along the Bay, within sensitive habitat areas such as wetlands, and along the Refugio Creek corridor. Development would not typically be allowed within this area except for recreation facilities, caretaker housing and accessory structures directly related to the use and maintenance of an open space area. Any developed facilities allowed by use permit in P/QP-O zone shall meet P/QP-P regulations.

C. P/QP-P Public/Quasi-Public—Park. To designate and permit public park and recreation areas within the City. The parks are improved and natural areas with facilities for active and passive recreation use. Other public and quasi-public uses associated and compatible with recreational use of a park may be allowed by use permit as noted in Table 13-10.1. New park facility development is typically to be 1 to 2 stories in height, with a FAR of 0.10 to 0.40 (typical FAR of 0.25).

D. P/QP-S Public/Quasi-Public—School. To designate and reserve sites for schools within the City. The designated school sites include existing and proposed public schools. School land uses include school buildings, “portables,” athletic facilities and associated utilities. Other public and quasi-public uses associated and compatible with school operations may be allowed by use permit as noted in Table 13-10.1. New school facility development is typically to be 1 to 2 stories in height, with a FAR of 0.20 to 1.00 (typical FAR of 0.40). [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 10.100.]

Sec. 13-10.200 Review of Plans and General Conditions.
Plans for all new and expanded development and uses shall be submitted to the Community Development Director as per Section 13-40.300. The following general conditions shall apply to all areas designated for public/quasi-public uses within this Chapter.

1. All new and expanded development shall be subject to Chapter 13-42, Design Review.

2. All new and expanded public and quasi-public development shall apply for an administrative or conditional use permit.

3. Public and quasi-public development projects of 5 acres or more shall require a planned development plan as per Chapter 13-48. Open space areas to be maintained in open space without development of facilities other than trails and paths are not required to submit a planned development plan. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 10.200.]

Sec. 13-10.300 Performance Standards.
The standard performance standards for development specified in Chapter 13-31 shall be met. In addition, the following specific performance standards shall be met:

1. An open space buffer zone to protect tidal habitat is to be along the Bay when designing a bay access trail linkage between Pinole and Rodeo. Public access and pedestrian pathways shall be limited within the buffer zone, and when possible, located along the edges of the buffer zone. Bicycles shall be encouraged to stay on bike paths through the use of signage and fencing.

2. The City will practice water conservation in management of parks and requirements for landscape design development.

3. No critical facility or school shall be permitted in areas subject to very strong ground shaking or ground failure until an evaluation of alternative sites with reduced earthquake and flood hazards is completed. An alternative site feasibility assessment shall include a consideration of sites in areas with lesser earthquake (and flood) hazards in addition to considerations of service area, accessibility, and economic considerations. If the alternative site feasibility study for a critical facility or school were to indicate that other less hazardous sites are not available for the critical facility, then geotechnical studies and structural design processes for the facility would be conducted in compliance with State of California requirements and recommendations of the Seismic Safety Commission.

For the other types of public/quasi-public facilities, the alternative site feasibility assessment will be an optional requirement of the City (an alternatives site evaluation may be required under CEQA). A rigorous geotechnical evaluation and structural design process will be required to ensure that the proposed structures perform in major earthquakes without creating a life safety hazard to occupants or people in surrounding areas. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 10.300.]

Sec. 13-10.400 Land Use Regulations.
All new and expanded development and uses that are allowed in the public/quasi-public zoning districts are identified in Table 13-10.1. These uses may be permitted in the public/quasi-public zoning districts subject to compliance with Chapter 13-49 and approval by the Community Development Director. Open space areas with natural areas and passive use on lawn areas and trails are permitted without being subject to use permit approval.

In addition to the general purposes listed in Section 13-5.100, the specific purposes of the I-R industrial residential mixed-use district are to:

1. Create the opportunity for an integrated mixture of residential space and workspace in the same structure. The residential space, generally located above the workspace such as a loft, is to provide a living area for persons employed in the work space.

2. Provide lower cost, leasable or owner occupied space for start-up companies, craft workshops, cottage industries, or other businesses that require less support services or amenities than R & D or office uses and are not of an intense industrial nature incompatible with shared residential use.

3. Provide an attractive, lower cost alternative for small scale point of sale enterprises with low traffic generation such as mail order businesses.

4. Create an additional alternative and incentive for the adaptive reuse of industrial, warehouse and office buildings.

5. Attract residents interested in establishing smaller scale start-up and cottage industries in a live-work facility.

6. Allow small scale and lower intensity industrial uses that are generally compatible with the air quality, noise, vibration, and safety standards associated with residential use. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 13.100.]

Sec. 13-13.200 Review of Plans and General Conditions.

Chapter 13-17. WC Waterfront Commercial District
Sec. 13-17.100 Specific Purposes.
In addition to the general purposes listed in Section 13-5.100, the specific purposes of the WC waterfront commercial district are to:

1. Reserve designated waterfront areas for a mix of commercial, public, recreation and open space uses that are consistent with the General Plan and preserve and enhance the characteristic meeting of land and water.

2. Create an attractive destination point for public access to and along the waterfront for residents of the City and surrounding communities.

3. Provide for appropriate waterfront related private and public/semi-public uses on Hercules Point and the Hercules waterfront.

4. Provide goods and services for visitors to public recreation and access areas along the waterfront.

5. Ensure that the appearance and effects of commercial buildings preserve and enhance the enjoyment of the waterfront’s scenic setting, open views, and natural habitats.

6. Protect sensitive habitats of the shoreline area while providing trails and access points along the shoreline.

7. Provide for shoreline use and waterfront development consistent with the McAteer-Petris Act and the Bay Plan. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 17.100.]

Sec. 13-17.200 Review of Plans and General Conditions.
Plans for all new and expanded development and uses shall be submitted to the Community Development Director as per Section 13-40.300. The following general conditions shall apply to all areas designated WC, waterfront commercial.

1. All new and expanded development shall be subject to Chapter 13-42, Design Review, and Chapter 13-48, Planned Development Plans. Subdivision or partial development of any properties within this district shall not be approved until a planned development plan for full development of the property has been reviewed and approved. Other uses that can be shown to support visitor recreation and access within the waterfront commercial area or along the adjacent waterfront areas may be approved with a conditional use permit.

2. All new and expanded uses shall be consistent with an adopted planned development plan for the property and shall require an administrative or conditional use permit.

3. A shoreline access and management plan for the property is to be prepared as part of the planned development plan to identify sensitive shoreline areas, buffer areas, a trail and access system, signage, and access area maintenance.

4. An erosion control plan is to be prepared as part of the planned development plan to control sediment drainage to salt marshes and other wetlands, sensitive habitats, and natural drainage. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 17.200.]

Sec. 13-17.300 Performance Standards.
The standard performance standards for development specified in Chapter 13-31 shall be met. In addition, the following specific performance standards shall be met:

1. Design. Structures shall be designed with an attractive architectural theme consistent with the waterfront character of the site. In general, buildings should be designed and located so that lower, 1 story heights are along the edge of the waterfront development with higher building heights allowed to step back from the waterfront.

2. Shoreline Habitat Vegetation. Provide a reasonable buffer between development and adjacent salt and mud flat areas. Revegetation in special habitat areas and buffers should be of a native and approved nonnative species requiring no irrigation and little management.

3. Visual. Structures and landscaping are to be located and designed to protect existing view corridors and create additional view corridors of the Bay and shoreline within the planned development plan area.

4. Light and Glare. Waterfront structures should use nonreflective surfaces, and night lighting is to be designed to minimize glare on access and habitat areas.

5. Shoreline Access Design. Public access along the shoreline is to be provided through a shoreline trail and vertical access points within the project. Shoreline access design is to conform to the guidelines and standards contained in the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) publication Public Access Design Guidelines.

6. Soils and Geology. Where possible, development of buildings over areas of Bay Mud should be avoided. Development shall meet all requirements of geology and soils reports.

7. Noise. Predrilling shall be required for driving piles in the waterfront area. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 17.300.]

Chapter 13-18. NTC New Town Center District
Sec. 13-18.100 Specific Purposes.
The specific purposes of the proposed NTC zone are listed as follows:

1. Create a transit-oriented town center consisting of a relatively dense pattern of building in the center of town and a mix of residential, commercial, office, and public and quasi-public uses.

2. Create an interconnected network of pedestrian-oriented streets, blocks, and publicly accessible open spaces.

3. Establish commercial and retail development in the area around Sycamore and San Pablo Avenues and along SR 4.

4. Create a vibrant, urbanized place for shopping, working, and living at the core of Hercules.

5. Create a mix of neighborhood-serving retail and commercial uses around 1 or more new town squares.

6. Develop according to principles of transit-oriented development and urban design identified in the Central Hercules Plan Regulating Code (see Chapter 13-28).

7. Encourage development that promotes walking, biking, and transit use.

8. Provide transit users with opportunities to reduce vehicular travel by creating opportunities to purchase goods and services at or near transit stations.

9. Promote transit by providing attractive and convenient multiple-use transit stations or centers.

10. Promote regional employment opportunities based on access to regional transit facilities.

11. Work with transit agencies to develop both short-term and long-term transit facility uses in Hercules.

12. Create central gathering places where residents of Hercules can meet, shop, and socialize. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 445, 2009; ZO § 18.100.]

Sec. 13-18.200 Review of Plans and General Conditions.
General conditions would apply to all new and expanded development in the NTC zone, subject to sections of the Zoning Ordinance, including: Chapter 13-42, Design Review; Chapter 13-48, Planned Development Plans; and Chapter 13-49, Specific Plans, or another process approved by the Community Development Director. Additionally, as stated above, new and expanded development must have a finding of consistency with the general planning and design intent of the Central Hercules Plan (CHP) Regulating Code (Chapter 13-28) and complement its character.

Furthermore, all development proposals within the NTC zone would be reviewed for:

1. Careful planning to avoid potential negative impacts of one use on another;

2. Easy and convenient access by foot and bike to transit facilities;

3. A balance of open space, landscaping, recreation, and transit access;

4. Adequate parking while also allowing for parking reductions for shared parking arrangements;

5. Buffers for noise, light, and glare;

6. Unified development with an emphasis on pedestrian access to and from transit component(s) of the development; and

7. Attractive frontages along public highways and street rights-of-way. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 445, 2009; ZO § 18.200.]

Sec. 13-18.300 Performance Standards.
In addition to the general conditions described above, all new and expanded development would be subject to general performance standards specified in Chapter 13-31 in addition to the following specific performance standards, including:

1. Design/architectural theme;

2. Street connectivity for vehicles and pedestrians;

3. Maximum block length;

4. Light and glare prevention/reduction;

5. Landscaping;

6. Usable open space minimums;

7. Integrated open space network;

8. Noise insulation/attenuation; and

9. Design and location of parking facilities. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 445, 2009; ZO § 18.300.]

Sec. 13-18.400 Land Use Regulations.
Because the NTC is intended to be a mixed-use district, any proposed use would require a land use permit as identified in Table 13-18.1 (Land Use Regulations: NTC District). These uses may be allowed/permitted subject to approval of: either an administrative use permit (A), or a conditional use permit (C) and demonstration of compliance with Chapter 13-48.

Other uses may be allowed within the NTC zone subject to approval of a CUP that can be shown to support mass transit, benefit from the availability of mass transit, provide goods and services to transit users, or contribute to creating a full service transit-oriented commercial public facility. Because the emphasis of the NTC zone is on mixed use, multiple combinations of uses would be allowed as identified in Table 13-18.1.

Sec. 13-18.600 Relationship of the NTC Zone to the Central Hercules Plan Regulating Code.
The CHP Regulating Code includes a section regarding the “mandatory” or “permissive” application of the standards. This flexible option allows properties to be developed in strict accord with the underlying zoning or follow the design standards and provisions of the CHP. The proposed NTC land use designation and zone establish land use and development standards that will be applied to the development of properties in that area, and by adoption of the proposed ordinance would supersede the “permissive” option of the CHP for those properties within the NTC area. Therefore, all development in the NTC would be subject to the standards in the NTC zone, including:

1. Administrative or conditional use permits established in the land use regulations; and

2. The property development standards/regulations described in this Chapter that generally would be subject to the planned development plan review and approval established in Chapter 13-48.

Additional findings still would be required that the proposed plan: (A) is consistent with the general planning and design intent of the CHP Regulating Code, and (B) complements the character of the planning and design in the balance of the area covered by the CHP Regulating Code.

[Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.100.]

Sec. 13-30.200 Setbacks and Yards.
The yard space provided about any structure as a yard or setback in compliance with the regulations for the district in which the property it is located shall not be allowed to provide a yard space for any other structure. Required yard spaces and setbacks are identified within the property development regulations of each zoning district and some overlay districts. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.200.]

Sec. 13-30.210 Setback and Yard Measurement.
Setbacks and yards shall be measured as the minimum horizontal distance from the property line of the site to a line parallel with the front, side or rear face of a building. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.210.]

Sec. 13-30.220 Allowed Projections into Setbacks and Yards.
Architectural features including bay windows, sills, canopies, chimneys, cornices and eaves may extend into a required side yard or a space between structures not more than 24 inches and may extend into a required front or rear yard not more than 3 feet.

Open, unenclosed, uncovered balconies, porches, platforms, stairways, and landing places, no part of which is more than 4 feet above the surface of the ground, may extend into a required side yard or space between structures not more than 3 feet and may extend into a required front or rear yard not more than 6 feet.

Fire escapes may project into rear and interior side yards or spaces between buildings not more than 3 feet.

Fences, walls, hedges, walks, driveways and retaining walls may occupy any required yard or other open space, subject to the limitations prescribed in this Chapter.

No structure or projection may intrude into a public utility easement. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.220.]

Sec. 13-30.300 Coverage and Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
The amount of site coverage and FAR allowed for a building or buildings within a zoning district or overlay district is identified within the property development regulations of the district. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.300.]

Sec. 13-30.310 Coverage and Floor Area Ratio Measurement.
The percent of the site area covered by structures shall be measured by dividing the total horizontal area covered by structures open or enclosed by the total horizontal area within the property lines of the site.

The floor area ratio of a site shall be measured by dividing the total usable floor area of structures on the site, excluding areas used exclusively for vehicle parking and circulation, by the total horizontal area within the property lines of the site. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.310.]

Sec. 13-30.320 Coverage and Floor Area Ratio Exemptions.
The City may consider allowing development agreements that will provide additional community parks and recreation facilities, such as ballfields and other areas for organized recreation, in exchange for allowing development at greater than the “typical” FAR, as specified in the property development regulations of some zoning districts. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.320.]

Sec. 13-30.400 Residential Density.
The residential density allowed within residential and mixed-use zoning districts is identified within the property development regulations of the district. New development shall not exceed maximum allowed residential densities unless there are specific regulations allowing density bonuses that are granted for a project by the City Council. The midrange density specified within the residential zoning districts is meant to be a general guide for the average density expected across the community for all property within that particular zoning district.

The density of residential development allowed on any parcel within the City should take into account site specific considerations including but not limited to, topography, economics, neighborhood compatibility, provision of affordable housing, and market conditions along with the capability of a proposed development project to further the specific goals, policies and objectives of the General Plan. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.400.]

Sec. 13-30.410 Residential Density Calculation.
Residential density is calculated as a gross density for all residential units within a property or planned development plan area. Gross density is calculated by dividing the total number of units by the total area of the site including roads, open spaces and public facilities. The minimum lot size represents the maximum net density for single-family attached and detached homes. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.410.]

Sec. 13-30.420 Residential Density Bonuses—Purpose and Applicability.
1. This Section through Section 13-30.470 are intended to implement the housing element of the General Plan and the requirements of California Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918, offering incentives for the development of affordable housing. Where regulations are not specifically addressed in these sections or where there are conflicts between these provisions and the provisions of California Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918, the provisions of the California Government Code, as they may be amended over time, shall apply.

2. Housing developments are eligible for a density bonus as provided in California Government Code Section 65915 and these provisions, when the applicant for the housing development agrees or proposes at least 1 of the following:

A. Construct:

1) Ten percent of the total units affordable to lower-income households at affordable rent or affordable housing cost; or

2) Five percent of the total units affordable to very low-income households at affordable rent or affordable housing cost; or

3) Ten percent of the total units proposed in a common interest development for sale to moderate-income households; provided, that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase; or

4) A senior citizen housing development.

B. Donate land in accordance with California Government Code Section 65915.

3. In addition to meeting the requirements of subsection (1) of this Section, housing developments which include a child care facility in accordance with California Government Code Section 65915 are entitled to an additional density bonus.

4. An applicant may also submit a proposal for specific incentives or concessions to be granted in conjunction with the density bonus, as provided in Section 13-30.440.

5. The granting of a density bonus, incentive, or concession, in and of itself, shall not require a General Plan amendment, zone change, or other discretionary approval and shall be reviewed concurrently with the review of the housing development.

6. To qualify for a density bonus, a senior housing development is not required to provide affordable units; however, the entire development must be reserved for qualified senior persons pursuant to Section 51.3 of the California Civil Code. Also, any senior housing development for which a density bonus is requested and approved must have a minimum of 35 units. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 484 § 12, 2015; ZO § 30.420.]

Sec. 13-30.430 Residential Density Bonuses—Calculation.
1. Housing developments that meet the criteria in Section 13-30.420(1) are eligible for a maximum density bonus as set forth in Table 13-30.1.

2. The calculation of a density bonus in compliance with this subsection that results in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number, as required by state law. For purposes of calculating a density bonus, the residential units do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels.

Sec. 13-30.440 Residential Density Bonuses—Incentives and Concessions.
1. A housing development is eligible for incentives and concessions as shown in Table 13-30.2. Incentives and concessions must be selected from only 1 category (very low-, low-, or moderate-income).

2. For purposes of this Section, permissible concessions and incentives include but are not limited to:

A. A modification of development standards or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code that would otherwise be required, including but not limited to a reduction in setback requirements, lot coverage, landscape coverage, or number of parking spaces, such that the reduction or modification results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions.

B. Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development, and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing project will be located;

C. Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the City which result in identifiable financially sufficient and actual cost reductions.

3. A housing development which requests incentives or concessions must show that the requested concessions are required to provide for affordable rents or affordable housing costs, as applicable. The Director shall determine the type and detail of documentation that must be provided.

4. If the housing development is eligible for a density bonus as provided in Section 13-30.420, upon request of the applicant, the maximum off-street parking standards that can be applied, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, are indicated in Table 13-30.3. These may include tandem and uncovered parking spaces.

5. Nothing in this Section requires the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including but not limited to the provision of financial subsidies, publicly owned land by the City, or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. The City, at its sole discretion, may choose to provide such direct financial incentives.

6. An applicant may submit to the City a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria outlined in Section 13-30.420 at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted under Section 13-30.440. A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled. The applicant shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the development standards that are requested to be waived will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development with the density bonuses and incentives.

7. The City Council shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant unless the Council makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following:

A. The concession or incentive is not required to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or for rents for the targeted units to be set in compliance with Government Code Section 65915(c); or

B. The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined by California Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and safety, or the physical environment, or on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 484 § 12, 2015; ZO § 30.440.]

Sec. 13-30.450 Residential Density Bonuses—General Requirements.
1. Affordable for-sale and rental low- and very low-income units must remain affordable to low- or very low-income households, as applicable, for 55 years or for a longer period of time if required by a construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program.

2. The affordable dwelling units and land dedication that qualify a housing development for a density bonus may also be used to meet the inclusionary housing provisions of the City’s inclusionary housing requirements (Municipal Code Title 10, Chapter 19), to the extent that the Inclusionary Housing requirements are applicable and/or operable; provided, that the affordable units and land dedication comply with the requirements of both the Density Bonus Ordinance (Sections 13-30.420 through 13-30.470), and the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (Title 10, Chapter 19) as it may apply regarding the required number of affordable units, required level of affordability, and term of affordability so as to provide the greatest affordability to the most households for the longest term.

3. The designated units shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the project, shall contain on average the same number of bedrooms as the nondesignated units in the project, and shall be compatible with the design or use of remaining units in terms of appearance, materials, and finished quality.

4. If a project is to be phased, the density bonus units shall be phased in the same proportion as the nondensity bonus units, or phased in another sequence acceptable to the City.

5. A master regulatory agreement shall be made between the developer and the City which indicates the household type, number, location, size and construction scheduling of all affordable units, and such information as shall be required by the City for the purpose of determining the developer’s compliance with this Chapter. The regulatory agreement shall be recorded against the housing development prior to final or parcel map approval or, where a map is not being processed, prior to issuance of any building permits, and shall be binding on all future owners and successors in interest.

6. The City may establish fees associated with the setting up and monitoring of affordable units.

7. For rental affordable very low- and low-income units:

A. The owner shall obtain and maintain on file certifications by each household. Certification shall be obtained immediately prior to initial occupancy by each household and annually thereafter, in the form provided by the City or its designee. The owner shall obtain updated forms for each household on request by the City, but in no event less frequently than once a year. The owner shall maintain complete, accurate, and current records pertaining to the housing development, and will permit any duly authorized representative of the City to inspect the records pertaining to the affordable units and occupants of these units.

B. The owner shall submit an annual report to the City, on a form provided by the City. The report shall include for each affordable unit the rent, income, and family size of the household occupying the unit.

C. The owner shall provide to the City any additional information required by the City to ensure the long-term affordability of the affordable units by eligible households.

8. For any application submitted or processed after January 1, 2015, an applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives or concessions under this Section if the housing development is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental dwelling units are or, if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished in the 5-year period preceding the application, have been subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income; subject to any other form of rent or price control through a public entity’s valid exercise of its police power; or occupied by lower or very low income households, unless the proposed housing development replaces those units (as defined by California Government Code Section 65915[c][3][B]), and either of the following applies:

A. The proposed housing development, inclusive of the units replaced pursuant to this paragraph, contains affordable units at the percentages set forth in Section 13-30.420(2).

B. Each unit in the development, exclusive of a manager’s unit or units, is affordable to, and occupied by, either a lower or very low income household. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 484 § 12, 2015; ZO § 30.450.]

Sec. 13-30.460 Residential Density Bonuses—Application Requirements.

A. Provide a written statement specifying the desired density increase, incentives and any waivers requested; proposed rent schedules and/or sales prices; and the type, location, size, and construction scheduling of all dwelling units;

B. Submit a project financial report (pro forma) demonstrating that the requested incentives will result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions to the housing development and they are required to provide for affordable rents or affordable housing costs, as applicable. The pro forma shall include the capital costs, operating expenses, return on investment, loan-to-value ratio and the debt coverage ratio including the contribution(s) provided by any applicable subsidy program(s), as required;

C. An appraisal report indicating the value of the density bonus and of the incentive(s)/concession(s);

D. A use of funds statement identifying the financial gaps for the housing development with the affordable housing units. The analysis shall show how the funding gap relates to the incentive(s)/concession(s);

E. For any requested waiver of a development standard, evidence that the development standard for which the waiver is requested will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development with the density bonus and incentives requested;

F. If a mixed-use building or project is proposed as an incentive, evidence that nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and that the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the development and the existing or planned development in the area;

G. If a density bonus is requested for a land donation, the location of the land to be dedicated, proof of site control, and evidence that each of the requirements included in California Government Code Section 65915(g) can be met.

Sec. 13-30.470 Residential Density Bonuses—Findings.
1. Before approving an application that includes a request for a density bonus, incentive, parking reduction, and/or waiver pursuant Sections 13-30.420 through this section, the decision-making body shall make all of the following findings, as applicable:

A. That the residential project is eligible for the density bonus and any incentives, parking reductions, or waivers requested.

B. That any requested incentive will result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions based upon the financial analysis and documentation provided.

C. That there are sufficient provisions to guarantee that the units will remain affordable for the required time period.

D. If the density bonus is based all or in part on donation of land, a finding that all the requirements included in California Government Code Section 65915(g) have been met.

E. If the density bonus, concession, or incentive is based all or in part on the inclusion of a child care facility, a finding that all the requirements included in California Government Code Section 65915(h) have been met.

F. If the concession or incentive includes mixed-use development, a finding that all the requirements included in California Government Code Section 65915(k)(2) have been met.

G. If a waiver is requested, a finding that the development standards for which the waiver is requested would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development with the density bonus and incentives permitted.

2. If the findings required by subsection (1) of this Section cannot be made, the City Council may deny an application for a concession, incentive, or waiver only if it makes 1 of the following written findings, supported by substantial evidence:

A. The concession, incentive, or waiver is not required to provide for affordable housing; or

B. The concession, incentive, or waiver would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety or the physical environment or on real property listed in the California Register of Historic Resources, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households. For the purpose of this subsection, “specific adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application for the development was deemed complete; or

C. The concession, incentive, or waiver is contrary to State or Federal law.

3. If the findings required by subsection (1) of this Section can be made, the decision-making body may deny an application for a density bonus or incentive that is based on the provision of child care only if it makes a written finding, based on substantial evidence, that adequate child care facilities are already available in the City.

Sec. 13-30.700 Landscaped Areas.
Landscaping is an essential component of the overall design and aesthetics of a project. Landscaping along major regional streets and highways should soften the appearance of traffic and parking along these routes, while allowing view corridors to retail and other businesses.

Landscaping plans should implement effective water conservation, use of drought-resistant landscaping and irrigation with reclaimed wastewater. Native plants are to be used in landscaping.

Plantings that serve to screen views of residential development, or that help to maintain a natural-appearing landscape, shall be retained to the extent feasible. Such plants could be thinned selectively if thinning would improve view corridors. If specific trees are to be removed, such as eucalyptus trees, replace with trees, preferably native species that will provide suitable screening while retaining important view corridors.

1. The landscaping and irrigation requirements listed in this Section shall apply to all proposed development or construction at undeveloped parcels, or as determined by the Community Development Director, which shall include but not be limited to the following developments:

A. Common areas and landscape easements of all single-family subdivisions.

B. All new single-family residential estate lots.

C. Common areas at multifamily residences, including apartment and condominiums and duets.

D. Model homes.

E. Commercial, industrial and mixed-use projects.

F. Public buildings, grounds and facilities.

G. The reconstruction or rehabilitation of the common areas and landscape easements at residential projects and nonresidential buildings, projects or developments where either:

1) The value of the reconstruction or rehabilitation exceeds 25 percent of the current assessed value of the building, project or development; or

2) The area of the landscaping affected by the reconstruction or rehabilitation exceeds 25 percent of the landscaped area.

The requirements do not apply to that portion of a site, or to projects or development using reclaimed water or well water, or additions or modifications to existing single-family residences, nor to portions of site area irrigating edible crops, or not receiving irrigation.

2. Landscaping and irrigation shall be installed and maintained according to the approved plan. All water in the common areas of a development project used ornamentally, such as ponds, lakes and fountains, shall be supplied, operated and maintained with alternative sources of water if they are available. The landscaping and irrigation plan shall implement the following standards:

A. Plant Selection. At least 75 percent of the plants proposed in nonturf areas shall be well-suited to the climate of the region and require minimal water once established. Up to 25 percent of the plants may be of a nondrought tolerant variety as long as they are grouped together and can be irrigated separately.

B. Turf Area and Water Surface Area Limitations: The combined turf area and/or water surface area (i.e. pools, ponds and fountains) shall be limited to 25 percent of the irrigated areas. Exceptions may be granted by the Planning Commission when using drought-tolerant turfgrasses (i.e., with a water requirement less than or equal to tall fescue). Turf area and/or water surface area limitation does not apply to public parks, golf courses, cemeteries, school recreation areas, and on-site private recreational facilities. No turf shall be allowed in:

1) Median strips.

2) Areas less than 8 feet wide.

C. Soil Conditioning and Mulching.

1) Scarify soil compacted by grading prior to planting.

2) A minimum of 6 cubic yards of nitrified soil conditioner per 1,000 square feet shall be incorporated into the top 6 inches of soil.

3) A minimum of 2 inches of mulch shall be added in nonturf areas to the soil surface after planting. Nonporous material shall not be placed under the mulch.

4) Soil tests showing soil type, soil depth, uniformity and pH shall be submitted with landscape plans. Soil will be amended according to report recommendations.

5) Grading shall be minimized to avoid disturbance. Top soil shall be stockpiled and shall be reapplied during final grading.

6) Use low-nitrogen, slow release fertilizer for lawns and shrubs.

D. Irrigation.

1) Sprinklers and sprays shall not be used in areas less than 8 feet wide.

2) Sprinkler heads with a precipitation rate of 0.85 inches per hour or less shall be used on slopes exceeding 15 percent or on slopes exceeding 10 percent within 10 feet of hardscapes to minimize runoff.

3) Valves and circuits shall be separated based on water use.

4) Drip or bubbler irrigation systems are required for trees. Bubblers shall be used that do not exceed 1.5 gallons per minute per device.

5) Sprinkler heads must have matched precipitation rates within each control valve circuit.

6) Popup sprinklers in lawn areas shall have at least a 4-inch popup height.

7) Check valves are required where elevation differences may cause low head drainage.

8) Sprinkler head spacing shall be designed for head-to-head coverage. The system should be designed for minimum runoff and overspray onto nonirrigated areas.

9) Electrical controllers shall be set to water between 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m.

10) All irrigation systems shall be equipped with a controller capable of dual or multiple programming. Controllers must have multiple cycle start capacity and a flexible calendar program.

11) All irrigation systems shall be equipped with rain shutoff devices.

12) Plans shall include a water budget that includes:

A) Estimated annual water use (in gallons).

B) Irrigated area (in square feet).

C) A monthly irrigation schedule for the plant establishment period and the following year. This irrigation schedule will include the following information for each valve:

(1) Plant type.

(2) Precipitation rate.

(3) Run times in minutes per day.

(4) Number of watering days per week (turfgrasses should be irrigated a maximum of once every 3 days).

E. Minor modifications to approved plans (including changes proposed by individual homeowners to approved plans for single-family subdivisions) which meet the requirements of this Section may be approved by the Community Development Director as per Chapter 13-46.

F. Minor exceptions from the requirements of this Section may be approved as part of the design review process; provided, that the Planning Commission finds the landscape and irrigation plans meet the intent these requirements. See Chapter 13-45.

3. Maintenance of Landscaped Areas. Landscaping provided in compliance with this Section shall be planted with materials suitable for screening or ornamenting the site, whichever is appropriate, and plant materials shall be watered, weeded, pruned, fertilized, sprayed or otherwise maintained as needed or required by the Planning Commission. Landscaping shall be replaced as necessary to provide the approved and required screening or ornamentation of the site. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.700.]

Sec. 13-30.750 Paving Within Residential Front, Rear, and Side Yard Areas.
The requirements specified in this Section are intended to preserve the residential character of streetscapes in the City’s neighborhoods and minimize excess stormwater runoff. The unregulated expansion of paved parking areas in front, rear, and side yards interferes with the pattern of building and open areas within neighborhoods, and can increase vehicle clutter by creating small parking lots in yard areas which are intended to remain as open areas.

Excessive paving of yard areas can negatively impact the character and appearance of residential areas. Paving yard areas to add additional parking can result in the proliferation of curb cuts that can have the effect of reducing the number of on-street parking spaces available.

1. The paving requirements in this Section shall apply to all residential properties and lots.

2. New paving and hardscape areas (e.g., walkways, patios, etc.) that exceed 120 square feet in total area shall require a paving permit issued in compliance with Section 13-5.700, Zoning Clearance Procedure.

3. The Planning Director shall hear and decide requests for reasonable accommodation as well as unique circumstances of flag lots, cul-de-sacs, or corner lots which make strict compliance with the requirements of this Section impractical.

4. Within 6 months of final passage of the ordinance codified in this Section, staff shall promulgate administrative guidelines and regulations further defining what types of surfaces and materials are permissible for landscaping, paving, driveways, and walkways consistent with this Division.

A. Front Yards.

1) Driveways. The amount of allowable paving for driveways shall not exceed 35 percent of the total front yard area. “Front yard” is defined as the yard area forward of the primary structure as illustrated in Figure 13-30.751 (Limits on Paving and Hardscaping for Residential Front, Rear, and Side Yards).

2) Walkways and Other Hardscape. The amount of paved walkways and hardscape shall not exceed 25 percent of the front yard area. See Figure 13-30.751 (Limits on Paving and Hardscaping for Residential Front, Rear, and Side Yards).

3) Landscaping Minimums. For all residential properties, a minimum of 40 percent of the front yard area shall consist of a permeable landscaped area, excluding pavers, bricks, and other hard surfaces, even if permeable.

B. Rear and Side Yards.

1) The total amount of paved surface in the rear and side yard combined for driveways, walkways, and hardscape combined shall not exceed 60 percent of the total rear yard area. “Rear and side yard” are defined as the yard area behind the front portion of the primary structure as illustrated in Figure 13-30.751 (Limits on Paving and Hardscaping for Residential Front, Rear, and Side Yards).

2) Landscaping Minimums. For all residential properties and lots, a minimum of 40 percent of the required rear and side yard combined area shall consist of a permeable landscaped area, excluding pavers, bricks, and other hard surfaces, even if permeable.

C. Stormwater Runoff Limitations. Impermeable surfacing may not exceed the stormwater runoff design for the parcel or lot, and must not cause runoff to affect adjacent property. Applicants in the RS-L Residential Zone shall be required to submit to the City Engineer calculations by a registered civil engineer demonstrating consistency with this policy as a condition of approval when the impermeable surfacing, including all structures, would be greater than 47 percent of the entire lot. For all other residential zones, the City Engineer shall require applicants to submit calculations by a registered civil engineer demonstrating consistency with this policy as a condition of approval based on administrative regulations promulgated by staff to address stormwater runoff in zones other than RS-L. The administrative regulations required to be promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall be established within 1 year of final passage of the ordinance codified in this Section and updated thereafter as circumstances require.

Figure 13-30.751 (Limits on Paving and Hardscaping for Residential Front, Rear, and Side Yards)

[Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 511 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.750.]

Sec. 13-30.800 Open Space.
1. Usable Open Space. Usable open space is required within several zoning districts to serve residents, visitors and employees of a project or property. Usable open is distinct from required landscaped areas in that the open space is to be specifically designed for use rather than aesthetics. Where usable open space is required within a zoning district, it shall be in addition to any landscaping requirement and public parks requirement. Usable open space may be provided in the form of small play areas, plazas, balconies, decks, usable yard areas, open space trails, or other similar spaces. The minimum usable open space area is 50 square feet of contiguous area not less than 5 feet wide in any location. Open space trails shall not provide more than 50 percent of the usable open space requirement of a project.

2. Open Space for Public and Conservation Uses. Public and conservation oriented open spaces provide public access to natural, scenic and historic areas; protect sensitive environmental areas, and provide protection and buffers from safety hazards. These open spaces offer amenities that benefit the quality of life in the community; preserve existing natural topography, ridgelines and valleys where feasible and desirable; preserve foraging habitat for wildlife; and provide for wetlands mitigation, flood control improvements and riparian corridors.

Open spaces should be planned for a buffer of irrigated landscaping and/or plowed area maintained between open spaces and developed areas, fire access trails in major open spaces to allow fire equipment to penetrate, use of fire resistant plant materials in open space landscaping, and containment of potential fires where natural vegetation exists in open spaces.

A. Wetlands mitigation, flood control improvements and riparian corridors should not be used in the calculation of required park space, parks, or recreational areas. However, the City may accept such areas in the calculation of required park space if they are accessible to the general public for use and enjoyment.

B. Areas that could provide habitat for sensitive species shall be surveyed by qualified biologists provided by project sponsors prior to project design. Surveys in sensitive areas shall be conducted prior to any development. Sensitive areas within the study area includes eucalyptus groves, freshwater wetlands and adjacent trees, open grasslands, ponds and creeks. If any sensitive species are present, coordination with the CDFG will be required for mitigation of impacts and redesigning of the project footprint to avoid any sensitive species or sensitive habitat. If avoidance is unavailable, coordination with the CDFG will be required for relocation of these species and for determining replacement of habitat.

C. As much open space as possible within sites proposed for development shall be retained as informal open space for wildlife habitat, rather than as formal, landscaped parks or grounds. Wildlife areas shall be revegetated with native or nonnative grassland and native species of shrubs requiring no irrigation and little management beyond the first year after planting. Wildlife habitat shall be consolidated into “preserves” that are as large as possible. Habitats on adjoining parcels shall be as contiguous as possible, to create wildlife corridors. Wildlife open space shall be placed adjacent to other wildlife habitat, to preserve the greatest ecological value.

D. Appropriate buffer zones along the Bay shall be established in consultation with CDFG, BCDC, East Bay Regional Park District, and the Corps of Engineers to protect tidal habitat when designing a bay access trail linkage between Pinole and Rodeo. Public access and pedestrian pathways shall be limited within the buffer zone, and when possible, located along the edges of the buffer zone. Signage and fencing shall be designed to encourage bicycles to stay on the bike paths.

E. Public access to wildlife habitat shall be minimized by placing trails close to buildings so as to provide the largest area of habitat possible with the least amount of impact from the public. Trails, if any, shall be placed close to buildings so as not to disturb wildlife nesting/denning areas.

F. Open space areas shall be designed into the footprint of proposed projects and shall be located adjacent to existing open space areas, providing a larger continuous area for wildlife to use.

G. Open space areas, if disturbed during construction, shall be landscaped with native species. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.800.]

Sec. 13-30.900 Public Facilities.
All discretionary land use approvals shall be conditioned upon payment of fees or construction of facilities necessary to serve all public infrastructure needs generated by the new development. Public infrastructure shall include, but not be limited to the following: local and regional transportation improvements; parks and recreation facilities; open space; wastewater collection, treatment and disposal capacity; drainage and flood control facilities; schools; and utilities.

New public infrastructure facilities and other associated improvements shall be designed and constructed according to the procedures and standards of the City. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.900.]

Sec. 13-30.910 Access, Circulation and Streets.
All structures and uses shall have adequate access to public streets. Access can be provided by means of accessible frontage along public streets or permanent public, private or reciprocal easements that provide adequate access to public streets.

Street rights-of-way and improvements are to be dedicated by projects as necessary to provide adequate internal circulation and external access. New residential areas shall be designed to avoid conflict with major streets or thoroughfares, to have access to transit facilities, and to encourage safe and convenient alternatives to the private automobile.

Developers of new residential areas are encouraged to work with transit agencies in the design and location of bus stops, turnouts, pavement materials and the timing of development in relation to transit service needs. To promote safe and well-designed neighborhoods, new residential development is to have an internal circulation system, including pedestrian walkways, bikeways, and access to transit facilities.

New streets, paths and sidewalks are to be designed and constructed according to the procedures and standards of the Director of Public Works. See Standard Drawings and Design Policy for Public Works. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 30.910.]

Chapter 13-31. Performance Standards
Sec. 13-31.100 Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth performance standards for development and uses for specific zoning districts and general performance standards that are applied for all zoning districts. These standards are intended to produce an attractive and safe community environment consistent with the goals, policies and standards of the General Plan. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 31.100.]

Sec. 13-31.200 Applicability.
The performance standards of Section 13-31.300 apply to all uses and development that require Zoning Ordinance permits and approvals. In some cases, the performance standards refer to specific properties within the City. No permit shall be approved unless applicable performance standards are met. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 31.200.]

Sec. 13-31.300 Performance Standards.
1. Archaeological Resources. If previously unknown subsurface cultural resources are discovered during excavation activities, excavation shall be temporarily halted and an archaeologist consulted as to the importance of the resources. Should the archaeologist determine that the resources are important, the project sponsor would follow the procedure described below. The program shall be conducted under the guidance of Appendix K of the CEQA Guidelines.

A. Prior to development on Parcels 1, 2, 3, 4, A, C and I (as identified in the Land Use and Circulation Element EIR (1996)), an attempt shall be made through a combination of archival research and in-field testing to identify areas that may have been used by Native American populations. Areas containing prehistoric deposits will be mapped; evaluation of their significance will be required only in those areas where future development might affect the resources.

B. Prior to excavation and construction in areas of known archaeological sensitivity, the prime construction contractor and any subcontractors shall be cautioned on the legal and/or regulatory implications of knowingly destroying cultural resources or removing artifacts, human remains, bottles, and other cultural materials from the project site.

C. The project sponsor shall identify a qualified archaeologist prior to any demolition, excavation, or construction in areas of known archaeological sensitivity. The City shall approve the project sponsor’s selection for a qualified archaeologist. The archaeologist shall have the authority to temporarily halt excavation and construction activities in the immediate vicinity (10-meter radius) of a find if significant or potentially significant cultural resources are exposed and/or adversely affected by construction operations.

D. Reasonable time would be allowed for the qualified archaeologist to notify the proper authorities for a more detailed inspection and examination of the exposed cultural resources. During this time, excavation and construction shall not be allowed in the immediate vicinity of the find; however, those activities may continue in other areas of the project site.

E. If any find were determined to be significant by the qualified archaeologist, representatives of the project sponsor or construction contractor and the City, the qualified archaeologist, and a representative of the Native American community (if the discover is an aboriginal burial) should meet to determine the appropriate course of action.

F. All cultural materials recovered as part of the monitoring program shall be subject to scientific analysis, professional museum curation, and a report prepared according to current professional standards.

2. Combustibles and Explosives. The use, handling, storage and transportation of combustibles and explosives shall comply with the Uniform Fire Code, the Hazardous Waste Management Plan Element of the General Plan, the Nuisance Abatement Ordinance (Title 4, Chapter 10 of the Municipal Code) and other applicable laws.

3. Dust and Dirt. All uses and development shall be conducted to minimize dust and dirt emissions beyond the project site or property. In addition to complying with the Grading Ordinance (Title 7, Chapter 2 of the Municipal Code), compliance with the following standards shall be required:

A. Property owners, developers and contractors shall be responsible for dust control measures (such as watering graded areas daily) and the immediate clean-up of any materials spilled on city streets as a result of grading, construction or hauling operations.

B. Dust and dirt shall be controlled so that it is not carried by air, water or other means to adjacent or nearby properties.

4. Environmental Resources and Constraints.

A. Development proposals shall be reviewed in terms of natural features in the vicinity that have aesthetic significance. This may include open space or vegetation that serves as a view corridor or has important visual attributes. Development proposals shall be sited to ensure that these features are retained or replaced to the extent feasible, resulting in minimal view impairment.

B. The City shall require project proponents to design facilities to prevent degradation of riparian and wetland communities from urban pollutants in storm runoff.

C. The City shall require project proponents to design construction footprints to avoid any wetlands and CDFG and or COE approved buffer zones around the wetlands in the project area. If avoidance is not possible, projects shall be redesigned so as to impact the least amount of wetlands. Any areas that are classified as wetlands and will be affected by project development shall be recreated either on or off site in accordance with CDFG and COE requirements. A project sponsor shall be required to obtain a Streambed Alteration Agreement from CDFG and/or a Section 404 Corps permit prior to any development or discharge of fill within any wetland or creek.

The small marshland westerly of the Southern Pacific Railroad, adjacent to the waterfront park, should be preserved in its natural state. The only improvement to this area would be an elevated walkway for observation of shorebirds and other wildlife.

D. Design of building footprints along any riparian corridor shall be outside the CDFG and/or COE approved buffer zone. Sensitive riparian habitats shall be marked by a qualified biologist to deter any destruction by equipment during construction.

E. Development along any riparian corridor shall incorporate measures to avoid impacts during construction, including:

1) Construction of any access bridge shall be limited to the bridge footprint area only.

2) Parking of large equipment shall be on the upland grassland area or on the paved street. Construction workers cars shall have designated parking areas.

3) Basins for oil leaks from the equipment shall be installed if equipment is parked on site over night.

F. Development shall be set back from Refugio Creek as required by Chapter 13-22, Refugio Creek Overlay District. West of I-80, the existing low flow channel will be improved to contain 100-year flood flows. The drainage facility shall be designed as a multi-use open space corridor and landscaped to have a natural appearance and enhance wildlife habitat. Designs which reduce water velocity and erosion are encouraged.

G. As much open space as possible within sites proposed for development shall be retained as informal open space for wildlife habitat, rather than as formal, landscaped parks or grounds. Wildlife areas shall be revegetated with native or nonnative grassland and native species of shrubs requiring no irrigation and little management beyond the first year after planting.

1) The extensive side hill in the southeast portion of the City has large areas of dense coyote brush interspersed with live oaks and buckeye and should be left in its natural state except for trails, outlooks and other limited recreational improvements.

2) The oak groves in canyon bottom and side hills shall be preserved in their natural state where possible. Special care should be taken in construction operations to minimize damage to this valuable natural resource.

3) The grass covered hilltops and slopes that are interspersed with residential areas in the easterly portion of the City should be preserved in a natural state as much as practical due to its habitat value for many species of raptors.

5. Erosion and Runoff Control.

A. Runoff increase calculations are required for each proposed development project. The calculations shall identify runoff for the parcel at full build-out as measured against estimates of existing runoff in order to ensure that no flooding will result.

B. Installation of sedimentation and grease basins in the storm drain system in parking lots in accordance with NPDES regulations (Title 5, Chapter 8 of the Municipal Code), is required to minimize pollution downstream from sedimentation. Property owners shall maintain the basins annually, or as required by NPDES regulations. Parking lots shall be swept periodically to decrease the amount of debris that could potentially contaminate the riparian or wetland habitat.

C. Development projects shall prepare and implement a set of best management practices (BMPs) to reduce impacts to water quality. Such practices may include, but are not limited to:

1) Stormwater retention or detention structures;

2) Oil and water separators; and

3) Sediment traps.

6. Geology and Soils. Projects proposed in areas subject to very strong earthquake ground shaking or ground failure shall conduct geotechnical studies and structural design evaluations for all critical facilities, schools, high-population facilities (such as shopping malls) and industries using or generating significant amounts of hazardous materials. If the alternative site feasibility study for a critical facility or school were to indicate that other less hazardous sites are not available for the critical facility, then geotechnical studies and structural design processes for the facility would be conducted in compliance with State of California requirements and recommendations of the Seismic Safety Commission. These should include detailed studies of the geologic materials at the site, seismic event response evaluations to identify design criteria, foundation design criteria and dynamic method analyses of proposed structures, and others.

For the other types of facilities, the alternative site feasibility assessment is an optional requirement, however an alternatives site evaluation may be required under CEQA. A rigorous geotechnical evaluation and structural design process shall be required to ensure that the proposed structures perform in major earthquakes without creating a life safety hazard to occupants or people in surrounding areas.

All development and construction projects shall be consistent with the following standards along with the requirements of the Grading Ordinance.

A. Development and construction shall minimize the potential for creating new landslides or reactivating old ones.

B. Improperly compacted existing fills and backfills should be excavated from areas to be filled.

C. All areas to be graded should be stripped of vegetation and the top few inches of highly organic topsoil.

D. Organic topsoil should be stripped, stockpiled and used for landscaping.

E. Lower valley areas where bay mud deposits are exposed or are blanketed by shallow thicknesses of poorly compacted fill will require detailed studies prior to site grading.

F. Sidehill “sliver” cuts and fills should be avoided.

G. Special consideration should be given to slope stability in the steep hillside areas.

H. Steep sideslopes should be left in their natural condition where possible.

I. Setbacks should be determined based on detailed soils investigations in individual cases opposite landslide prone slopes to reduce the potential for slide damage to improvements.

J. Expansive soils should be considered in the design of road pavement sections.

K. Site planning should consider the potential of differential settlement where compressible soils exist.

L. Areas underlain by soft bay mud will require further detailed soils investigations.

M. Slopes should be planted as soon as possible after completion of construction to develop a protective organic mat.

N. Dense pockets of brush and trees located on steep slopes should be left intact where possible to prevent potential landsliding.

O. The sides of the stream channel in portions of Refugio Valley should be improved to protect erosion induced slumping. Care should be taken to maintain the natural appearance of the water-course in open space areas.

7. Hazardous and Toxic Materials.

A. The use, handling, storage and transportation of hazardous and toxic materials shall comply with the Uniform Fire Code, the Hazardous Waste Management Plan Element of the General Plan, and other applicable laws.

B. The project applicant for each potentially contaminated location within the City, shall have the site inspected by a registered environmental assessor (i.e., a professional environmental scientist or engineer registered as an REA in California) for the presence of hazardous materials and wastes.

8. Historic Resources. Renovations, additions and other changes to historic buildings within the HTC historic town center district and the historic overlay district shall conform to the requirements of these districts in addition to the requirements set forth below. Historic buildings that are outside the above zoning districts shall conform to the requirements set forth below.

A. Prior to development on Parcels 1 and C as identified in the Land Use and Circulation Element EIR (1996), an updated architectural evaluation of the remaining Hercules Powder Company buildings shall be prepared. The elements of architectural evaluation program should include:

1) An architectural evaluation of remaining company buildings by a qualified architectural historian.

2) A determination of whether the remaining buildings are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

3) On the basis of the above findings, the City should take action to commit the eligible buildings to permanent conservation by having them listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Adaptive reuse of listed buildings, including historically sensitive restoration, is encouraged as a means of preserving eligible structures. Restoration and renovation of buildings should be performed in accordance with the “Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.” The standards serve as guidelines for rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, retaining and preserving historic character of the property.

4) If the above findings show that a building is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, then a Phase II evaluation shall identify historic resources on a parcel, and recommend appropriate mitigation measures to be incorporated into the project design using widely accepted standards for historic resources management, such as the Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines for Rehabilitation and the State Historic Building Code.

9. Light and Glare. The light and glare potential of uses and new development shall be attenuated on a parcel specific basis, applying the following measures so that glare shall not be visible beyond the property line of the use or development.

A. Screening of parking areas by using vegetation or trees. This will reduce the amount of glare generated from painted and chrome automobile surfaces and prevent expanses of stationary and moving automobiles.

B. Hooded lights for nighttime illumination should be used for parking areas, shipping and receiving docks and industrial development. Hooded lights direct the light beam towards the ground where dark pavement will not reflect light and cause spillage into neighboring uses.

C. Nonreflective windows should be used for research and development, and office park developments.

10. Mechanical Equipment Screening.

A. All exterior mechanical equipment, except within the I industrial district and as specified in subsection (10)(B) of this Section, shall be screened from all sides. Equipment to be screened includes, but is not limited to electrical, heating, air conditioning, refrigeration, plumbing, and ductwork.

B. Utility meters shall be screened from view from public rights-of-way. Meters within a corner front yard or in a side yard adjacent to street shall be enclosed in subsurface vaults.

C. The screening shall be of materials that blend with the building design and any adjacent landscaping.

11. Noise.

A. New residential development projects shall meet acceptable exterior noise level standards. The noise contour map on file at City Hall shall be used to screen projects to determine if acoustical studies will be required. The “normally acceptable” noise standards for new land uses established in Land Use Compatibility for Community Exterior Noise Environments shown in Table 6 shall be modified by the following:

1) The maximum acceptable noise levels in residential areas is a Ldn of 60 dBA. This level shall guide the design and location of future development, and is a goal for the reduction of noise in existing development. A 60 dBA Ldn goal will be applied where outdoor use is a major consideration (e.g., backyards in single-family housing developments and recreation areas in multifamily housing projects). The outdoor standard will not normally be applied to small decks associated with apartments and condominiums, but these will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Where the City determines that providing a Ldn of 60 dBA or lower cannot be achieved after the application of feasible mitigations, a Ldn of 65 dBA may be permitted at the small decks at the discretion of the City Council.

2) Indoor noise level shall not exceed a Ldn of 45 dBA in new housing units. If the noise source is a railroad, then the outdoor noise exposure criterion should be 70 dBA Ldn for future development.

3) Noise levels in new residential development exposed to an exterior Ldn of 60 dBA or greater shall be limited to a maximum instantaneous noise level in bedrooms of 50 dBA. Maximum instantaneous noise levels in all other habitable rooms should not exceed 55 dBA. The typical repetitive maximum instantaneous noise level at each site would be determined by noise monitoring. Examples would include truck passbys on busy streets, train passbys and train warning whistles.

4) Appropriate interior noise levels in commercial, industrial, and office buildings are a function of the use of space and shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Interior noise levels in offices generally should be maintained at 45 dBA Leq (hourly average) or less.

5) For nontransportation related noise sources, outdoor noise levels within a residential property should not exceed the limits in Table 76 of the Noise Element of the General Plan. Interior noise levels shall be 15 decibels lower than those shown in Table 7.

B. New nonresidential land development projects shall meet acceptable exterior noise level standards set forth in Table 6 of the Noise Element of the General Plan. The noise contour map on file at City Hall shall be used to screen projects to determine if acoustical studies will be required.

C. Noise created by commercial or industrial sources associated with new projects or developments shall be controlled so as not to exceed the noise level standards set forth in Table 7 of the Noise Element of the General Plan as measured at any affected residential land use.

D. Control the level of noise at noise-sensitive land uses generated by construction activities through implementation of the following measures:

1) For construction near noise-sensitive areas, as determined by the Community Development Department, require that noisy construction activities (including truck traffic) be scheduled for periods, according to construction permit to limit impact on adjacent residents or other sensitive receptors.

2) Require a construction schedule that minimizes potential cumulative construction noise impacts and accommodates particularly noise-sensitive periods for nearby land uses (e.g., for schools, churches, etc.)

3) Where feasible, require that holes for driven piles be predrilled to reduce the level and duration of noise impacts.

4) Where feasible, construct temporary solid noise barriers between source and sensitive receptor(s) to reduce offsite propagation of construction noise. This measure could reduce construction noise by up to 5 decibels.

5) Require internal combustion engines used for construction purposes to be equipped with a properly operating muffler of a type recommended by the manufacturer. Also, require impact tools to be shielded per manufacturer’s specifications.

E. Noise Attenuation Techniques: Where noise levels exceed community noise standards for a proposed land use, 1 or more of the following techniques may be required to reduce the noise to acceptable level.

1) Proper site planning to reduce noise impacts should be investigated for a project. By taking advantage of the natural shape and contours of the site, it is often possible to arrange the buildings and other uses in a manner which will reduce and possibly eliminate noise impact. Site planning techniques include:

A) Increasing the distance between the noise sources and the receiver.

B) Placing nonnoise sensitive structures such as parking lots, maintenance facilities and utility areas between the source and the receiver.

C) Using nonnoise sensitive structures such as garages to shield noise-sensitive areas.

D) Orienting buildings to shield outdoor spaces from a noise source.

2) Architectural Layout. In many cases, noise reduction requirements can be met by giving attention to layout of noise-sensitive spaces. Bedrooms, for example, will be considerably quieter if placed on the side of the house facing away from the freeway. Similarly, balconies facing freeways should be avoided. Quiet outdoor spaces can be provided next to a noisy highway by creating a U-shaped development which faces away from the highway.

3) Noise Barriers. To be effective, a noise barrier must be massive enough to prevent significant noise transmission through it and high enough to shield the receiver from the noise source. The minimum acceptable surface weight for a noise barrier is 4 lbs./sq. ft. (equivalent to 3/4-inch plywood) and the barrier must be carefully constructed so that there are no cracks or openings. To be effective, a barrier must interrupt the line-of-sight between the noise source and the receiver.

12. Odor. No use, except within the I industrial district and the P/QP-C public/quasi-public—city district shall emit any obnoxious odor or fumes. Uses within the I industrial district and the P/QP-C public/quasi-public—city district shall minimize emittance of any obnoxious odor or fumes to the extent feasible.

13. Pipelines and Pipeline Right-of-Way. Consistent with pipeline operators’ standards, no buildings or other structures that could impede access shall be installed in any pipeline right-of-way. Prior to the start of construction on any parcel that includes or is bordered by a pipeline or pipeline right-of-way or easement, the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District and the operators of affected pipelines shall be consulted regarding the adequacy of safety procedures for pipeline accidents. Developers of residential projects adjacent or nearby to pipelines shall notify new homeowners of the presence of the pipeline through a notice in the recorded deed.

14. Storage.

A. There shall be no visible exterior storage of equipment; supplies; motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or their component parts; and refuse, garbage, junk or their receptacles except as allowed within the Zoning Ordinance, Municipal Code and other laws.

B. All allowed exterior storage, except within the I industrial district, shall be screened by landscaping, fences, walls or hedges as per Section 13-30.600.

15. Tree Removal. Tree removal regulations within the City are set forth in Title 4, Chapter 15 of the Municipal Code.

16. Undergrounding Utilities. All utility distribution facilities (including but not limited to electric, communication and cable TV lines), including utility service laterals and equipment, installed in and for the purpose of supplying service to any building or property shall be placed underground, except as follows:

A. Equipment appurtenant to underground facilities, such as surface mounted transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and risers from concealed ducts.

B. Poles supporting street lights.

Undergrounding shall be in compliance with Title 10, Chapter 6, Utility Undergrounding.

17. Vibration. No vibration associated with any use shall be discernible beyond the property line of the use. Vibration within a property shall be controlled so that it does not constitute an annoyance or nuisance to other uses within the site.

18. View Corridors. Development shall preserve important view corridors, where feasible. The attributes of the view corridor that characterize its significance as seen from roadways, pedestrian paths or other public vantage points shall be identified and preserved to avoid view obstruction. Buildings shall be sited so as to minimize view obstruction from sensitive viewpoints. The following views, from publicly accessible viewpoints, shall be preserved to the maximum extent feasible:

A. Upper drainage views from higher elevations of the Sycamore site adjacent to City Hall easterly up the floor of Franklin Canyon.

B. Lower drainage views from Hercules Point north across open water to Lone Tree Point and beyond to Solano and Napa Counties.

C. Lower drainage ridge views from the promontory of San Pablo Bay, Lone Tree Point, Franklin Canyon and the Refugio Creek floodplain.

D. San Pablo Avenue views of specimen oak tree stands and, where feasible, of eucalyptus groves.

E. Views of San Pablo Bay and the Hills of Marin, Sonoma and Napa Counties, and inland of the Briones Hills, that are available from various elevation points on undeveloped properties west of I-80 and from the shoreline areas along the Bay.

F. Views from the former Hercules Powder Company offices on the promontory to the west, north and east.

19. Water Conservation.

A. Use of drought-resistant landscaping is required in new developments. Installation of low-flush toilets and other low-flow plumbing fixtures is required for new residential and commercial development.

B. Installation of dual plumbing systems in large developments to accommodate future use of reclaimed wastewater for nondomestic purposes such as landscape irrigation, commercial and industrial process uses and toilet flushing in nonresidential buildings is encouraged. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 31.300.]

Chapter 13-32. Off-Street Parking and Loading Facilities
Sec. 13-32.100 Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to:

1. Provide safely accessible, aesthetically attractive, well landscaped, screened and maintained off-street parking facilities.

2. Alleviate or prevent traffic congestion and shortage of curb spaces, off-street parking and loading facilities for new land uses and major alterations and enlargements of existing land uses.

3. Provide for adequate off-street parking and loading area design to assure their usefulness, protect the public safety and, where appropriate, insulate surrounding land uses from their impact. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 32.100.]

Sec. 13-32.200 Applicability.
All new uses, new structures, and major alterations or expansions of existing uses and structures shall provide off-street parking and loading facilities as per Tables 13-32.1 and 13-32.2. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the parking facilities required in this Chapter are provided. A use permit may be revoked if, at any time, adequate parking facilities are not provided and available for use as required.

1. No existing use of land or structure shall be considered a nonconforming use or a nonconforming structure solely because of the lack of off-street parking facilities or off-street loading facilities prescribed in this Chapter; provided, that facilities being used for off-street parking and off-street loading shall not be reduced in capacity to less than the number of spaces or berths required or reduced in area to less than the minimum standards.

2. No off-street parking facility or off-street loading facility provided for a use of land or structure shall be reduced in capacity or in area without sufficient additional capacity or additional area being provided to comply with the regulations of this Division.

3. Off-street parking facilities and off-street loading facilities shall be provided for a major alteration or enlargement of a site or structure which would increase the number of parking spaces required by 10 percent or more over existing levels of use or supply. The number of parking spaces or loading berths provided for a major alteration or enlargement of a site or structure shall be in addition to the number existing prior to the alteration or enlargement, unless the preexisting number is greater that the number required, in which instance the number in excess of the prescribed minimum shall be counted in calculating the number provided to serve the major alteration or enlargement.

4. Off-street parking spaces or off-street loading berths provided for a use of land or a structure shall not be used to provide for required off-street parking spaces or off-street loading berths for another use or a structure on another site, unless an easement or joint use agreement is recorded in the office of the County Recorder designating the off-street parking facility or the off-street loading facility with legal descriptions of both sites, and certifying that the off-street parking facility or the off-street loading facility shall not be used for any other purpose unless the restriction is removed by resolution of the Planning Commission. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until a certified copy of the recorded easement or joint use agreement has been filed with the Building Official.

Upon submission of satisfactory evidence that other off-street parking facilities or off-street loading facilities have been provided in compliance with the requirements of this Division or that the use has ceased or the structure has been removed or altered so as no longer to require the off-street parking facility or the off-street loading facility, the Planning Commission may by resolution remove the restriction. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 32.200.]

Sec. 13-32.300 Parking Standards.
1. Parking Spaces Required. The minimum number of parking spaces that shall be provided for a development or use is set forth in Table 13-32.1. If a use is not specified in Table 13-32.1, the same number of off-street parking spaces shall be provided as are required for the most similar specified use. The Planning Commission may require a greater number of parking spaces than the minimum specified in Table 13-32.1 in order to accommodate the parking demands of specific projects and uses.

For a use which operates on 2 or more shifts and the number of required off-street parking spaces is determined by the number of employees, the required off-street parking spaces shall be based upon the number of employees on the largest shift.

Off-street parking facilities requirements may be provided by the permanent allocation of the prescribed number of spaces for each use in a common parking facility as long as the total number of spaces provided shall not be less than the sum of the individual requirements. An executed and recorded copy of an agreement or joint use easement for the joint use of a common parking facility shall be filed with the application for a certificate of occupancy.

2. Calculation of Parking Spaces. The number of parking spaces required is calculated by determining the total size of the facility (such as dwelling units, seats, employees or 1,000 square feet of floor area, etc.) and multiplying this number by the number of spaces required per unit as shown in Table 13-32.1. If a fractional number of parking spaces result, 1 parking space shall be provided for a fraction of one-half space or more. No parking space shall be required for a fraction of less than one-half space.

If more than 1 use is located on a site or within a building, the number of parking spaces provided shall be equal to the sum of the requirements prescribed in this Table 13-32.1 for each use. However, if the development is a shopping center then all uses that share common walls or roofs will be calculated on a shopping center use basis. If there are separate pads with free standing buildings, their parking requirements shall be calculated as individual uses and added to the other shopping center parking requirements.

3. Handicapped Spaces. Handicapped spaces shall be provided as part of the required off-street parking spaces according to the standards set forth in Table 13-32.2.

4. Parking Space and Parking Lot Design Standards. Off-street parking facilities provided in compliance with subsection (1) of this Section shall meet the following standards:

A. Each standard parking space shall be not less than 18 feet in length and 9 feet in width, exclusive of aisles and access drives. Each compact parking space shall be not less than 16 feet in length and 8 feet in width, exclusive of aisles and access drives.

1) Not more than 40 percent of parking for a nonresidential project may be designated as compact parking;

2) At a residential project, up to 35 percent of parking may be designated as compact parking;

3) The minimum length of a standard and compact space may include a maximum overhang into adjoining landscaping of 18 inches;

4) Where a fence, wall or supports for a carport adjoin the length of a parking space, the width of that space shall be increased by 2 feet in addition to the width required by this Section.

B. Entrances into parking spaces located in a garage or carport shall have an overhead clearance of not less than 7 feet with a horizontal clearance of not less than 8 feet for per parking space.

Sec. 13-32.400 Loading Standards.
1. Loading Spaces Required. The minimum number of loading spaces that shall be provided for a development or use is set forth in Table 13-32.1. If a use is not specified in Table 13-32.1, the same number of loading spaces shall be provided as are required for the most similar specified use.

Off-street loading berths in addition to those prescribed in this Section shall be provided if the Planning Commission finds that such additional berths are necessary to assure that trucks will not be loaded, unloaded or stored on public streets. A finding of the Planning Commission shall be based on an investigation of the anticipated frequency of truck pick-ups and deliveries, and of the truck storage requirements of the use.

2. Calculation of Loading Spaces. The number of loading spaces required is calculated by dividing the total amount of a use unit in terms of the noted of measure, by the amount required for each parking space. If a fractional number of parking spaces is required, 1 loading space shall be provided for a fraction of one-half space or more, and no loading space shall be required for a fraction of less than one-half space.

B. Sufficient room for turning and maneuvering vehicles shall be provided on the site so it is not necessary for any vehicle to back onto the site from a public street.

C. Each loading berth shall be accessible from a street or alley.

D. Entrances and exits shall be provided at locations approved by the City Engineer.

E. The loading area, aisles and access drives shall be paved so as to provide a durable, dustless surface and shall be so graded and drained as to dispose of surface water. Pavement shall conform with either of the following minimum standards:

1) Asphalt paving: 2 inches of asphaltic concrete on 4 inches of aggregate base material or equal as determined by the City Engineer.

2) Concrete paving: 4 inches of Portland Cement concrete on 3 inches of aggregate base material or equal as determined by the City Engineer.

F. Bumper rails or curbs shall be provided where needed for safety or to protect property.

G. If the loading area is illuminated, lighting shall be deflected away from abutting streets and residential sites so as to cause no dangerous or annoying glare.

See Title 4, Chapter 15 of the Hercules Municipal Code. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO Ch. 33.]

Chapter 13-34. Sign Regulations
Prior legislation: Ord. 423.

Sec. 13-34.100 Purpose and Applicability.
The purpose of this Chapter is to:

1. Provide for the orderly construction, location, placement, size and maintenance of signs, outdoor advertising structures, and displays of any character, and to safeguard the general public from the hazards caused by dangerously and improperly located and maintained signs.

2. Promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare by regulating outdoor signs of all types. The specific goals are to protect property values, enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community, to reduce sign or advertising distractions and obstructions, and to ensure that new signs are compatible in design and scale with their surroundings.

Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, it is unlawful for any person to construct, erect, enlarge, alter, or relocate within the city any sign as defined in this Chapter, without first obtaining a sign permit for a sign or planned sign program, subject to design review approval, and a building permit. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 510 § 2, 2018; ZO § 34.100.]

Sec. 13-34.101 General Provisions.
[Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 510 § 2, 2018; ZO § 34.101.]

Sec. 13-34.102 Director Approval Required.
The Director of Community Development is authorized to approve, conditionally approve, or deny sign permits and sign programs, except where Planning Commission action is required, or when a referral to the Planning Commission is made in accordance with applicable sections of the Zoning Ordinance. Any application for a sign permit or sign program approval requiring action by the Director shall be acted upon within 30 days of submittal. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 510 § 2, 2018; ZO § 34.102.]

Sec. 13-34.103 Planning Commission Approval Required.
The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, review the application based on the criteria of this Chapter, and take action under the following circumstances:

1. The sign(s) does not conform to an established design policy adopted by the Planning Commission and/or City Council in accordance with this Section.

2. The sign is a freeway-oriented, freestanding pylon sign.

3. The approval of master sign programs or sign variances. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 510 § 2, 2018; ZO § 34.103.]

Sec. 13-34.200 Legal Conforming Signs.
Any sign that legally exists as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Section shall be considered a legal conforming sign.

1. Any legal conforming sign may be altered to reflect a change in use or occupancy advertised on the sign; provided, that sign has the same fixtures, similar materials, similar colors, and similarly styled lettering and provided the sign face is not enlarged as determined by the Community Development Director.

2. New signage may be proposed for a site that contains legal conforming signage; provided, that all new signage is in compliance with this Chapter. The Planning Commission may approve waivers to signage for a site that contains legal conforming signage, if such waivers are consistent with this Chapter. Such waivers may be made only if the signage plan for the entire site furthers the purpose of this Chapter by reducing visual clutter or otherwise improves the aesthetic appearance of the signage on the site by bringing the overall site into closer compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. A legally installed sign which does not comply with this Chapter may continue to be used and ordinary maintenance and repairs may be made to the legally conforming sign provided the structure is not moved, enlarged, or structurally altered. A legal conforming sign may not be replaced with one which is nonconforming. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 510 § 2, 2018; ZO § 34.200.]

Sec. 13-34.204 Termination of Business/Removal of Sign.
Any sign face that identifies or advertises a business must be removed within 30 days after the termination of that business from that site. After a period of 90 days of the termination of the business if the sign is not reused by another business occupying the same site, all mountings, brackets, poles, sign faces and other signage material must be removed.

4. Sinking Fund. The project sponsor of a proposed sign shall be required to provide proof of the establishment of a sinking fund to cover the cost of removing the sign if it is abandoned. The word “abandoned” shall mean a sign that has not been operational for a consecutive 90-day period, except where nonoperation is the result of maintenance or renovation activity pursuant to valid city permits. The sinking fund shall be established within a 2-year period, at a financial institution approved by the City’s Finance Department. The sinking fund payment shall be determined by the Finance Director and shall be adequate to defray expenses associated with the removal of the sign. The minimum amount for a sinking fund for any type of sign shall be $300.00. The maximum amount for a sinking fund for a sign shall be $3,000. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 510 § 2, 2018; ZO § 34.205.]

Sec. 13-34.206 Liability for Damages.
The provisions of this Chapter shall not be construed as relieving or limiting in any way the responsibility or liability of any person erecting or owning any sign, for personal injury or property damage resulting from the placement of such sign, or resulting from the negligence or willful acts of such person, its agents, employees, or workmen, in the construction, maintenance, repair, or removal of any sign erected in accordance with a permit issued under this Chapter; nor shall it be construed as imposing upon the City or its officers or employees any responsibility or liability by reason of the approval of any signs, materials, or devices under the provisions of this Chapter.

[Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; Ord. 510 § 2, 2018; ZO § 34.207.]

Sec. 13-34.208 Calculation of Size of Sign, Sign Area and Height.
1. Within or on Structures. When the graphic representation of the sign occurs on a sign board, the size of the sign shall be calculated by the square footage of the sign board. For illuminated signs, all portions of the sign which are illuminated shall be included in the square footage. In other cases where lettering is attached to a structure and no sign board is utilized, the square footage of the sign shall be calculated by drawing a rectangle around all portions of the lettering; the square footage of the sign shall be the area of the rectangle.

2. The sign area of wall-mounted and freestanding pylon and ground-mounted monument type signs shall be calculated as follows:

A. The area of a wall sign comprised of individual channel-type letters, numerals, symbols, or other similar components painted on or attached flat against the wall of a building, where such individual components are without integrated background definitions and are not within a circumscribed frame area, the total area of the sign shall be measured by the area enclosed by 4 vertical and horizontal straight lines containing each word or symbol.

B. Where a freestanding, monument, or pylon-supported sign has 2 faces, the area of both faces shall be included in determining the area of the sign. Sign height shall be measured as the vertical distance from grade adjacent to the sign footing, to the top of the sign, including the support structure and any design elements.

3. The regulations and limitations of this Section are intended to be maximum dimensions permitted.

6. On a lot where the rear yard faces a public street, a freestanding accessory structure shall not be located in the rear yard setback required for the main structure.

7. The maximum height of an attached accessory structure shall be as specified for the main structure, and for a freestanding accessory structure the maximum height shall be 15 feet, except that within 10 feet of a property line, no part of the structure shall exceed 8 feet.

8. In the RS-L district, freestanding accessory structures shall cover not more than 30 percent of the required rear yard, unless there remains a portion of the rear yard or a side yard which has an area of not less than 20 percent of the site, and that the least dimension of such yard shall be at least 15 feet.

9. Special Situations: The Community Development Director in consultation with the Director of Public Works and the Chief of the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District (or their designated representatives) shall have the authority to approve exceptions to these regulations in the following cases. In reviewing these situations, the Community Development Director may impose any conditions needed to fulfill the intent of this subsection. Any determination may be appealed to the Planning Commission.

A. For a structure built out of noncombustible materials, including a spa (but not including a gazebo or any other wood structure), the 5-foot setback may be reduced; provided, that the Community Development Director finds that the proposed structures will not significantly increase the fire hazard.

However, accessory structures with permanent foundations shall require design review through the Community Development Director. Accessory structures that are freestanding without permanent foundations such as prefabricated storage sheds do not require a use permit or design review as long as all criteria of this Section are met.

11. Before approving the proposed design plans for an accessory structure with a reduced setback (as allowed by this Section), pursuant to Chapter 13-42, Design Review, the Community Development Director shall notify the owners of parcels within 150 feet, and on the same side of the street as, the site of the proposed accessory structure that construction of an accessory structure has been proposed. If any written protest to the proposed structure is received within 15 calendar days of the mailing of such notice, the Director shall take no action regarding the structure and shall refer the matter to the Planning Commission for a public design review hearing and action.

A planned development plan shall include only uses and densities permitted in the zoning district in which the planned development plan is located.

All proposals for subdivision or development within zoning districts requiring planned development plans shall be required to submit a planned development plan application concurrently with other applications. There are 3 potential stages in the review process which are outlined below and include the following: (1) conceptual; (2) initial; and (3) final. The final stage includes design review as established in Chapter 13-42.

The final planned development plan encompasses the detailed building, landscaping, signage, and exterior lighting design of the project. Final planned development plans shall consist of both use permit and design review approval along with sufficient plans and exhibits to document all project features and conditions. The final planned development plan and design review must be approved prior to building permit issuance. [Ord. 515 § 2, 2018; ZO § 48.200.]

Sec. 13-48.300 Conceptual Planned Development Plan.
The conceptual planned development plan is an optional procedure intended to provide an opportunity for discussion and informal review of a proposed subdivision or development that requires a planned development plan. This process provides a forum to discuss the overall direction for the proposed project thereby enabling the landowner or developer to use the comments on the project prior to making a formal application. Conceptual planned development plans are generally recommended for projects that are large, complex, or may be subject to controversy. No environmental review is required for this process.

The following information shall be submitted for proposed conceptual planned development plans for subdivisions or developments. The information is to be submitted on site plan maps with accompanying text and tables. Site plan maps are to include an accurate land survey base.

1. Existing uses and densities and planned uses and densities in surrounding area according to the General Plan;

2. Proposed project land uses;

3. Circulation and access design for the entire tract or parcel of land;
