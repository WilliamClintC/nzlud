embody them into a unified Code. For example the codifier may:

subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in

existing section or other subdivision numbers;
4. Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning to “this
chapter,” “this article,” “this division,” etc., as the case may be, or to
“sections ______ to _________” (inserting section numbers to indicate the
sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the Code); and
1-8
5. Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original
meanings of ordinance sections inserted in the Code; but in no case shall the
codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

the ordinances and regulations of the city, such rules, ordinances and regulations are hereby amended
to provide that the time provided therein shall be and is hereby made eastern standard time in
accordance with law.

for the person bitten.
Section 4.53 Reporting Animals Suspected of Having Rabies.
It shall be the duty of every person having knowledge of the existence of an animal
apparently afflicted with rabies to report immediately to the Early County Health Department and
the City of Blakely the existence and description of such animal, the place where seen, the owner’s
name, if known, and the symptoms suggesting rabies.
Section 4.54 Reporting of Suspected Rabies Cases by Owners.
Whenever the owner or person having custody or possession of any animal shall observe or
learn that such animal has shown symptoms of rabies or has acted in a manner which would lead to
a reasonable suspicion that it might have rabies, such owner or person shall immediately notify the
City of Blakely and shall allow the Animal Control Officer and/or a representative of the Early
County Health Department to make an inspection or examination of such animal until it shall be
4-14
established that such animal does or does not have rabies.
Section 4.55 Disposition of Body of Suspected Rabies Cases.
It shall be the duty of the owner or person having custody of any animal suspected of having
rabies to surrender the carcass of the animal, or such portion of the carcass as may be requested, to
the Animal Control Officer after the death of the animal.
Section 4.56 Veterinarian to Quarantine Suspected Rabies Cases.
All veterinarians treating an animal indicating symptoms of rabies shall hold such animal in
quarantine until the disposition of said animal by the Animal Control Officer.
Section 4.57 Report of Animal Biting Animal Required.
It shall be the duty of every person having knowledge of any animal that bites another animal
to report immediately to the Early County Health Department the existence and description of such
animal; the owner’s name, if known; the place where the biting incident occurred; a description of
the bitten animal; and the name of its owner, if known.
Section 4.58 Management of Animals that Scratch or Bite Humans.
a. Dogs and Cats. A healthy dog or cat that bites or scratches a person or another animal
should be confined and observed for 10 days. This required quarantine applies to dogs and cats only.
Rabies vaccine should not be administered during the observation period. While in confinement,
any signs of illness should be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. The place of confinement shall
be at the veterinarian clinic or agency designated by the City of Blakely as the animal shelter at the
expense of the owner or person having custody or possession of the animal, the veterinarian chosen
by the owner or person having the custody or possession of the animal at said owner’s expense, or
any other confinement location so designated and approved by the City of Blakely. If symptoms
suggestive of rabies are observed, the animal should be humanely killed, and a specimen should be
submitted to a qualified laboratory for testing. If the animal dies during the quarantine period, the
specimen should be submitted immediately for rabies testing.
b. Stray Domestic Animals and Other Species. Any stray or unwanted animal that bites
or scratches a person or domestic animal may be humanely euthanized and a specimen submitted for
testing. Animals other than dogs or cats that bite or scratch a person and are suspected of being rabid
should immediately be reported to the Early County Health Department. Management of animals
other than dogs and cats is dependent on the animal species, the circumstances of the bite, and the
epidemiology of rabies in the area and shall be at the discretion of the Animal Control Officer or the
Early County Health Department or their authorized representative.
c. Livestock. Cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, goats, swine, and sheep are not likely to
4-15
be carriers of rabies. Treatment will be weighed against the circumstances of exposure by the
Animal Control Officer or the Early County Health Department or their authorized representative.
If at the time of exposure the animal is clinically ill with signs suggestive of rabies, the Animal
Control Officer or his authorized representative, or an authorized representative from the Early
County Health Department will immediately and humanely kill the animal and a specimen will be
submitted to a qualified laboratory for testing. The cost of testing will be the responsibility of the
animal owner, if known.
Section 4.59 Management of Animals Exposed to Rabies.
Any animal bitten or scratched by a bat or wild carnivorous mammal (particularly bobcat,
raccoon, fox, skunk, or coyote) which is not available for testing should be considered exposed to
rabies.
a. Unvaccinated Dogs and Cats Exposed to Rabies. Unvaccinated or unwanted dogs
and cats bitten or scratched by a known or potentially rabid animal should be humanely euthanized
immediately. If the owner or the animal is unwilling to have this done (upon approval of the
Department Head of the Early County Health Department and the City of Blakely) the exposed
animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month prior to being
released. The responsibility for isolation of an exposed unvaccinated animal remains with the owner.
The animal must be kept in a pen that has been built to the specifications of the State of Georgia
Rabies Control Manual Appendix “C”, and approved by the Department Head of Early County
Health Department and the City of Blakely. Additionally, a second fence 18-24 inches in distance
from the inner pen must be erected around the perimeter to guarantee complete isolation of the
quarantined animal from other animals and human contact. The total construction costs of this
confinement area is the sole responsibility of the pet owner. Previously vaccinated dogs and cats
whose rabies vaccination has lapsed from more than 30 days are considered unvaccinated and will
be treated as such.
b. Vaccinated Dogs and Cats Exposed to Rabies. Dogs and cats that are currently
vaccinated (vaccinated at least one month prior to exposure) should be re-vaccinated immediately,
confined, and observed for a period of time required by the Early County Health Department.
Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by the Early County Health Department.
c. Livestock Exposed to Rabies. Vaccinated livestock (vaccinated by a licensed
veterinarian with a USDA approved vaccine for that species at least 30 days prior to the attack) bitten
by a rabid animal should be re-vaccinated immediately, confined, and observed for 45 days.
Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by Early County Health Department.
d. Other Animals Exposed to Rabies. Unvaccinated animals bitten by a rabid animal
should be euthanized immediately. If an animal has been vaccinated with a USDA approved vaccine
for that species, the animal must be re-vaccinated immediately and placed in confinement for a
minimum of 90 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by Early County Health
4-16
Department.
Section 4.60 Quarantine of Area of City.
Whenever in the judgment of the City Council, after consultation with the Early County
Health Department, the public health and safety so require, the Council shall declare and establish
a quarantine zone or area consisting of the whole or any part of the City and maintain such
quarantine therein until such time as they may deem it advisable to lift the same. During the
existence of such quarantine, it shall be unlawful for any person to violate any of the rules and
regulations proscribed by the City Council with reference to such quarantine.
Section 4.61 Retention of Animals Suspected of Having Rabies.
a. If the Animal Control Officer or pound keeper operating a pound for the City suspects
that any animal impounded has rabies, he or she shall notify the Early County Health Department.
A qualified veterinarian shall examine such animal and if they believe such animal should be held
for future observation, they shall so inform the Animal Control Officer.
b. If an animal is found to be afflicted with rabies, the Animal Control Officer or agency
operating the pound for the City shall confine said animal as directed.
c. If an animal does not have rabies, the Animal Control Officer or agency operating a
pound for the City shall release it or dispose of it in the manner proscribed in this ordinance.
Section 4.62 Animal Exposed to Rabies Barred from City.

Section 4.70 Cruelty and Neglect to Animals Prohibited.
No animal in the incorporated areas of the City shall be subject to cruelty and/or neglect as
outlined in this section.
a. It shall be unlawful for any person to perform a cruel act on any animal; nor shall any
person harm, main, or kill any domestic animal, or attempt to do so, except that a person may:
1. Defend his person or property, or the person or property of another, from
injury or damage being caused by an animal; or
2. Kill any animal causing injury or damage to any livestock or poultry.
b. The method used for killing the animal in the situations outlined in item A above shall
be designed to be as humane as is possible under the circumstances. A person who humanely kills
an animal under the circumstances indicated in item A of this article shall incur no liability for such
death.
c. This section shall not be construed to limit in any way the authority or duty of any law
enforcement officer or Animal Control Officer.
d. It shall be the duty of the animal owner, caretaker, or possessor to provide adequate
shelter, food, water, and sanitary conditions at all times; and to provide necessary medical care
including, but not limited to, the required annual rabies inoculation. Failure to comply with this
section constitutes neglect and is a violation of this ordinance.
e. Any violation of this section shall be enforced as outlined in Article VIII of this
ordinance.
Section 4.71 Confiscation of Suspected Abused Animals.
If an Animal Control Officer and/or any law enforcement officer has reasonable cause to
believe that any animal is subject to abuse as defined in this ordinance, he shall confiscate and
impound the animal pending the conclusion of an investigation. Said investigation shall be
completed prior to the end of the seventh business day, at which time a finding shall be issued by the
Animal Control Officer. If a finding is made that the animal is being abused, cruelty to animal
charges shall be filed against the owner and the animal will become the property of the City of
Blakely. In the event that a determination is reached that the animal is not being abused, the animal
will be returned to its owner, and follow-up investigations may be conducted by the Animal Control
Officer at the discretion of the Animal Control Officer. The responsibility for costs related to the
confiscation and impoundment during the investigation will rest with the owner, regardless of the
4-18
determination reached.
Section 4.72 Protection of City Officials, Citizens, and Animals.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.70, any animal found at large in violation of this
ordinance, which cannot be safely impounded or poses a real threat to City officials, citizens, other
domesticated animals, or livestock, may be slain by any police officer or Animal Control Officer.
Such measures shall only be used when tranquilizing the animal fails or there is a significant risk of
immediate danger.

ARTICLE VII. CLASSIFICATION OF DOGS AS DANGEROUS OR VICIOUS
Section 4.80. Purpose, Definitions, and Exceptions
a. Purpose
Article VII of the Animal Control Ordinance is passed under the authority of and in
compliance with O.C.G.A. § 4-8-1 et seq. The purpose of this ordinance is to clearly define local
government responsibility, as well as limit the administrative and liability burdens upon the City
with regard to dangerous or Vicious Dogs.
As set forth in O.C.G.A. § 4-8-1, to the extent that the application of any provision hereof
would result in the control and regulation of dogs in a manner less restrictive that the minimum
standards provided for in O.C.G.A. Title 4, Chapter 8, then such provision contained herein shall
yield and the applicable provision contained in O.C.G.A. Title 4, Chapter 8 shall govern.
b. Definitions
Unless otherwise defined within this Article, all terms contained herein shall have the
definitions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 4-8-21. As provided in that Code Section, the following
definitions are incorporated herein:
1. “Classified dog” means any dog that has been classified as either a Dangerous
dog or Vicious Dog.
2. “Dangerous dog” means any dog that:
i. Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without
causing serious injury; provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or
abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under
this subparagraph;
ii. Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably
believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury to
such person or another person although no such injury occurs;
provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of
teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous
under this subparagraph; or
iii. While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however,
that this subparagraph shall not apply where the death of such pet
animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog,
herding dog, or predator control dog.
4-20
iv. “Serious injury” means any physical injury that creates a substantial
risk of death; results in death, broken or dislocated bones, lacerations
requiring multiple sutures, or disfiguring avulsions; requires plastic
surgery or admission to a hospital; or results in protracted impairment
of health, including transmission of an infection or contagious
disease, or impairment of the function of any bodily organ.
v. “Vicious dog” means a dog that inflicts serious injury on a person or
causes serious injury to a person resulting from reasonable attempts
to escape from the dog's attack.
If the definition of any term contained above is modified or amended as set forth in O.C.G.A.
Title 4, Chapter 8, then such term shall be deemed to have the meaning as provided by statute and
the definitions above shall yield to such statutory definitions.
c. Exceptions
1. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, a dog that inflicts an
injury upon a person when the dog is being used by a law enforcement officer
to carry out the law enforcement officer’s official duties shall not be a
Dangerous dog or a Vicious Dog within the meaning of this Article.
2. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, a dog shall not be a
Dangerous dog or a Vicious Dog within the meaning of this article if the
injury inflicted by the dog was sustained by a person who, at the time, was
committing a trespass, was abusing the dog, or was committing or attempting
to commit an offense under O.C.G.A. Title 16, Chapter 5.

designated Animal Control Officer, then the “Dog Control Officer” shall be appointed by the City
Council, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-22(b).
b. The Dog Control Officer’s duty of investigation and classification arises only after
a report is made to such Dog Control Officer regarding events which occurred within the

through federal delegation under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C.
Section 1251, et seq., and subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30.
State Waters: Any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds,
drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or
artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of Georgia which are not entirely
confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or
corporation.
Structural Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Practices: Practices for the
stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of
5-30
matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing
or runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control
practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade
stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication
Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.
Trout Streams: All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the
Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions
of the Georgia Water Quality Act, O.C.G.A. 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for Water Quality
Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are
defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams
designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout
reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout waters are streams into which no other streams
flow except springs.
Vegetative Erosion and Sedimentation Control Measures: Measures for the stabilization
of erodible or sediment producing areas by covering the soil with:
(a) Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or
(b) Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or
(c) Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass.
Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control
in Georgia.
Watercourse: Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch,
canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either
continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any
area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater.
Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a
prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally
include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

Section 5.44 Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution
Control Using Best Management Practices.
a. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing
activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore,
plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain
provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and
practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution
control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall
conform to the minimum requirements of Section IV B. and C. of this ordinance. The application
of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility
installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall
be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any landdisturbing
activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES General
Permit.
b. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS/BMPs.
1. Best management practices as set forth in Section IV B & C of this
ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design,
installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute
a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation
of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially
similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued
pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the “Georgia Water Quality
Control Act”. As used in this subsection, the terms “proper design” and
“properly designed” mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design
specifications contained in the “Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control
in Georgia” specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b).
2. A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best
management practices have not ben properly designed, installed, and
maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing
permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit
issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the
“Georgia Water Quality Control Act”, for each day on which such discharge
results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than
twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm
5-34
water fisheries or by mor than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for
waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall
be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director, this
paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the
construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such
construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres.
3. Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices
shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local
Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division
pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the “Georgia Water
Quality Control Act”, for each day on which such failure occurs.
4. The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the
Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving
waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
5. The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15 and
16, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c).
c. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A.
12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum,
protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices,
including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and
resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices
contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia
Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing
activity was permitted, as well as the following:
1. Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be
conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
2. Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
3. Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create
the lowest practicable erosion potential;
4. Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and
supplemented;
5. The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive element shall be
kept to a practicable minimum;
6. Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
5-35
7. Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed
critical areas during development;
8. Permanent vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed
critical areas during development;
9. To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the
use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the
disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is
stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it
is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of
O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.;
10. Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface
water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
11. Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
12. Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels
in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
13. Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or
culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case,
that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
14. Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution
control shall include provisions for the treatment or control of any source of
sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments
on-sire or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels
specified in Section IV B 2 of this ordinance;
15. Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established
a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally
from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or
wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that
is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where
otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a
drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed,
provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the
project plans and specifications, and are implements; or along any
ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term ‘ephemeral stream’
means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only
during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the
channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground
water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the
primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral
5-36
stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article
5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the “Georgia Water Quality Control Act”. Shall
remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in
this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
(a) No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and
a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation
until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are
completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a
buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
protective cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat
and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the
stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a
single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or
under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may
thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective
vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat
and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the
stream bed; and
(b) The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities,
provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of
crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular tot he stream; cause a
width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and
adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project
plans and specifications and are implemented: (I) Stream crossings
for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
16. There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point
where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action,
along the banks of any state waters classified as “trout streams” pursuant to
Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the “Georgia Water Quality Control Act’,
except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided,
however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which
discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have
a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner,
pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated
by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream
landowner’s property and the landowner complies with the buffer
requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a
variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that
adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and
specifications and are implemented. The following requirement shall apply
to such buffer:
(a) No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and
5-37
a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation
until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are
completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a
buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as longs as a
protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and
aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to
keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person
constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is
constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own
occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as
long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality
and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity
to keep shade on the stream bed; and
(b) The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities,
provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of
crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a
width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and
adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project
plans and specifications and are implemented: (I) Stream crossings
for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
d. Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing
Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream
buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section IV, B & C of this ordinance.
e. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in
injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a
violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.
Section 5.45 Application/Permit Process.
a. GENERAL.
The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and
review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review
the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance,
storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance,
this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the
development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. However,
the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
b. APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.
1. No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the
jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Blakely without first obtaining a
5-38
permit from the Building Inspector to perform such activity and providing
a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
2. The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Building Inspector,
and must include the applicant’s erosion, sedimentation and pollution
control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as
a minimum, the data specified in Section V C. of this ordinance. Erosion,
sedimentation ad pollution control plans, together with supporting data,
must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed
will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Section IV, B &
C of this ordinance will be met. Applications for a permit will not be
accepted unless accompanied by 1 copy of the applicant’s erosion,
sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a
certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the
site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.

to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees
shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees
shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state
general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the
planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees
shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a
jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8
half of the such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that
any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant
to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the
Division, regardless of the existence of a Local Issuing Authority in the
jurisdiction.
4. Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the Local
Issuing Authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its
review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion,
sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or
disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act
within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The
results of the District review shall be forwarded to the Local Issuing
Authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by
the District, and any variances required by Article IV, C, 15 & 16 has been
obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Article IV,
B, 6, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the Local
Issuing Authority and the District have entered into an agreement which
allows the Local Issuing Authority to conduct such review and approval of
the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. The Local
Issuing Authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a
revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the Local Issuing
5-39
Authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be
considered an approval of the revised Plan submittal.
5. If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this
ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended,
within three years prior to the date of filing the application under
consideration, the Local Issuing Authority may deny the permit application.
6. The Local Issuing Authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond
in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any
combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction
thereof of the proposed land-distributing activity, prior to issuing the permit.
If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of
the permit after issuance, the Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or
any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor
to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into
compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an
ordinance or statue specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of
any determination or order of the Local Issuing Authority with respect to
alleged permit violations.
c. PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
1. Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in
Article IV, B & C, of this ordinance, or through the use of more stringent,
alternate design criteria which conform to sound conversation and
engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in
Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan
for the land-distributing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the
soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography,
watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways,
constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management
facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive
computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design
professional. Persons involved in land development design, review,
permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing
activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements,

Checklist established by the Commission as of January 1 of the year in
which the land-disturbing activity was permitted.
5-40
d. PERMITS.
1. Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not
later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Local Issuing Authority of
a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained,
where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit
issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may
be undertaken.
2. No permit shall be issued by the Local Issuing Authority unless the erosion,
sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the District
and the Local Issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is
in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by Article IV, C,
15 & 6, are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Article V,

permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
3. Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to
the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating
to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall
enforce such requirements upon the Local Issuing Authority.
4. If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be
required for each phase.
5. The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the Local Issuing
Authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon
finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with
the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his
successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall
notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land

6. The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more
violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit
requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light
of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (f) (1).
Section 5.46 Inspection and Enforcement.
a. The Building Inspector will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing
activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in
accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion
and sedimentation. Also, the Local Issuing Authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary
permittee as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be
5-41
responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary
permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person
engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan,
with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall
be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve
compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person
engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed
in violation of this ordinance.
b. The Local Issuing Authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate
within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
c. The Building Inspector shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may
reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose
to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation
and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
d. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of
the Local Issuing Authority, the Commission, the District, or Division who requests entry for the
purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct,
hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official
duties.
e. The District of the Commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of

O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (1). The District or the Commission shall notify the Division and request
investigation by the Division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
f. The Division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities
which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to Code Section 12-7-8 (a). Such
review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of
a governing authority’s ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between
the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any
county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced
its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered int
pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (e), the Division shall notify the governing authority of the county or
municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall
have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a Local
issuing Authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within
90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county
or municipality as a Local Issuing Authority.

ARTICLE V. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE.
Section 5.56 Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Objectives.
a. Authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and
O. C. G. A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare.
b. Findings of fact.
1. The flood hazard areas of Blakely, Georgia are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
2. These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses
vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increase in flood heights and velocities.
c. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in
specific areas by provisions designed to:
1. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
2. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities,
or erosion;
3. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage or erosion, and;
4. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
5. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
d. Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
1. To protect human life and health;
5-47
2. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
3. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood
blight areas,
4. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
5. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
6. To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and;
7. To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
Section 5.57 General Provisions.
a. Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special
flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Blakely, Georgia.
b. Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified
by the federal emergency management agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated December
5, 2006, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted
by reference and declared a part of this article.
For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective
FIS dated December 5, 2006, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision
thereto, for the City of Blakely, Georgia are hereby adopted by reference.
Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded
historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private
parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. See attached list.*
The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps
and other supporting data is located: City Hall.
c. Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in
conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development
activities.
d. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted
or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
5-48
e. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate,
or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.
f. Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions
shall be: (1) Considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the
governing body, and; (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state
statutes.
g. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or
used permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not
create liability on the part of the City of Blakely or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made
hereunder.
h. Penalties for violation. Failure to comply with the provisions of this article or with
any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants
of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this article
or fails to comply with any of the requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more
than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all
costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a
separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Blakely from taking such other
lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Section 5.59 Provision for Flood Hazard Reduction.
a. General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are
required:
5-51
1. New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall
be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure;
2. New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall
be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage;
3. New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall
be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
4. Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of
existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the
lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed
so as to be unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be
designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
(a) Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified
by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following
minimum criteria:
(1) Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area
of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
(2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and,
(3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided they permit the
automatic flow of floodwater in both directions.
(b) So as not to violate the “lowest floor” criteria of this article, the
unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking
of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in
connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated are; and
(c) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or
finished into separate rooms.
5. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including
ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities
shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
5-52
6. Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited
to, use of over-the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall
be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for
resisting wind forces;
7. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
8. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters;
9. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and;
10. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which
is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only
if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
b. Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are
required:
1. New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood
elevation data area available, new construction and/or substantial
improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base
flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate
a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic
forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with
standards of section 5.59(a)(4), “Elevated buildings”.
(a) All heating and air conditioning equipment and components
(including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other
service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the
base flood elevation.
2. Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial
improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be
flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot
above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, and structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.
A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design
and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
5-53
practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such
certification to the official as set forth above and in section 5.58(c) (6).
3. Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base
flood elevation data are available:
(a) All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
(1) Individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially
improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in
expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or
(4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
where a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as
the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement,
elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation; or
(b) Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so
that either:
(1) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no
lower than one foot above the level of the base flood
elevation; or
(2) The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by
reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an
equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above
grade.
(c) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. (Reference section 5.59(a)(6), above).
(d) All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
(1) Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
(2) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its
wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached structures or additions); or
(3) The recreation vehicle must meet all the requirements for
“New construction”, including the anchoring and elevation
requirements of section 5.59 b 3 (a).,(c)., above;
5-54
4. Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
section 5.57(b), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an
extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion
potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order
to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights.
Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new
construction, substantial improvements or other development within
the regulatory floodway.
Development may be permitted however, provided it is
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed
in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or
floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered
professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and
certification thereof.
(b) Only if section 5.62(b)(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new
construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 5.59.
c. Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or
floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section
5.57(b), where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base
flood data have been provided by a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions
apply:
1. When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in
accordance with section 5.57(b), then the building inspector shall obtain,
review , and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation
and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order
to administer the provision of section 5.59. Only if data are not available
from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply:
2. No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located
within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is
greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
3. In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new
construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have
the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three
5-55
feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the
lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation
in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
provided in accordance with standards of section 5.59(a)(4) “Elevated
buildings”.
(a) All heating and air conditioning equipment and components
(including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other
service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the
highest adjacent grade at the building site.
d. Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard
established in section 5.59(b), may include designated “AO” shallow flooding areas. These areas
have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The
following provisions apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map
(FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least
three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate
the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance
with standards of section 5.59(a)(4), “Elevated buildings”.
The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the
record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
2. New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential
structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water
tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent
grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyance. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for
meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the
official as set forth above and as required in sections 5.58(b)(1)c. and (3)b.2.
3. Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from
any proposed structure.
e. Standards for subdivisions.
5-56
1. All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage.

Section 5.60 Variance Procedures.
a. The Blakely City Council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance
from the requirements of this article.
b. The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or
administration of this article.
c. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision
to the Superior Court of Early County, as provided in O. C. G. A. § 5-4-1.
d. Variance may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
e. Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a
5-57
functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative
exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
f. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway is any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
g. In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations,
relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
h. Conditions for variances:
1. A variance shall be issued only when there is:
(a) A finding of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinance.
2. The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss
reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed
carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character
and design of
the building.
3. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation
of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
4. The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon
request.
i. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the
city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
5-58
the purposes of this article.

or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures
are not exempt from any article requirements) for a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a

the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have occurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work
performed.
For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
The term does not, however, include: (1) Those improvements of a structure required to
comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified
5-63
by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair
project, or (2) any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or
improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction
in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article
is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times.
e. Discharges subject to review. The admission into the public sewers of any water or
wastes having a five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than 300 milligrams per liter,
containing more than 350 milligrams per liter of suspended solids, containing any quantity of
substance having the characteristics described in subsection (c) of this section, or having an average
daily flow greater than two percent of the average daily sewage flow of the City, shall be subject to
the review and approval of the superintendent.
11-26
f. Preliminary treatment facilities. Where necessary in the opinion of the
superintendent, the owner shall provide at his expense such preliminary treatment as may be
necessary to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to 300 milligrams per liter and the suspended
solids to 350 milligrams per liter, reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the
maximum limits provided for in subsection (c) of this section, or control the quantities and rates of
discharge of such water or wastes. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating
to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be commenced until such approval is obtained in

The City will generally supply natural gas at a pressure of approximately 0.25 pounds per
square inch gauge (“psig”). The City and the customer, however, may mutually agree upon a higher
pressure at which gas shall be delivered. In no event shall the City be required to furnish gas to the
customer at a pressure exceeding two psig for residential service, or five psig for all other classes of
service, except to the extent that the City has agreed to do so by written agreement.
Section 11.105 Relocation of City Meters and Equipment.
The City may change the location of facilities and rights-of-ways upon customer’s request,
but the customer must bear the expense of the change; provided, however, no change will be made
where it will interfere with or jeopardize City’s service, either to the customer requesting the change
or to any other customer(s). All privileges of the City incident to the original location shall apply
to the new location. When a meter is relocated at the City’s option, all expense in connection with
such change shall be borne by the City. If the relocation is made at the customer’s request, all
expense will be borne by the customer.
Section 11.106 Possession of Gas.
The customer agrees that the City is responsible only for the gas service to the delivery point
to the customer, and the City shall not be liable to customer or any of customer’s agents, servants,
or employees, or to any person whomever, for any loss, damage, of injury to any person or property
resulting from the said gas or its use after it leaves said delivery point. Customer agrees that
customer shall assume all such risks downstream of the point of delivery, except when caused by the
exclusive negligence or willful acts of the employees of the City.
Furthermore, the City shall not be responsible for the transmission, use, or control of gas
beyond the delivery point. The City shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or injury to person or
property whatsoever, accruing or resulting in any manner, from the receipt, use, or discontinuance

the flow of gas immediately. The City shall not be liable for any leakage of gas, or any damage or
loss arising out of, or caused by, and leakage of gas, except when due to the exclusive negligence
or willful acts of the employees of the City.
Section 11.108 Extension of Service.
a. The City will extend mains in streets that are at an established final grade for
distances up to 100 feet without charge to the customer. If a main extension exceeds 100 feet, the
City will perform a feasibility test and may require a CIAC to reimburse the City for the cost of any
main extension in excess of 100 feet and any other excess facilities necessary to extend service in
the event the anticipated revenue does not produce a reasonable return on the total cost of such
excess facilities.
b. The City will install up to 100 feet of gas service line (measured from the premises’
property line to the meter on the customer’s premises) at no charge. For installations requiring more
than 100 feet of gas service line, the City may require the customer to pay a CIAC.
c. Notwithstanding the above, if facilities in addition to a simple main extension and
service line are required, the City will perform a feasibility test to determine whether or not these
facilities will require the customer to pay a CIAC.
d. A CIAC may be required for facilities located at a point other than that selected by
the City or deviating from the route selected by the City.
At any time a feasibility test is required, the City shall also calculate the estimated cost of (1)
the main in excess of the 100 feet of main for which no CIAC is required and (2) the service line in
excess of the 100 feet of service line for which no CIAC is required for new customers occupying
existing structures. (For proposed new subdivisions, the allowances for extensions of mains and
service lines should be considered only for existing structures that plan to use gas at the time the
main is to be extended.) Any CIAC shall be the lessor or (1) the CIAC calculated in the feasibility
test or (2) the full cost of extending the lines beyond the initial allowances of 100 feet of main and
service line. The aforementioned feasibility test shall include all costs directly associated with the
service extension. The City may waive this requirement at its discretion on a case by case basis.
e. Notwithstanding paragraphs, (a), (b), and (g) of this section, the City will perform a
feasibility test to determine whether or not these additional facilities will require the customer to pay
a CIAC.
f. A CIAC may be required for facilities located at a point other than that selected by
the City or deviating from the route selected by the City.
11-32
g. At any time a feasibility test is required, the City shall also calculate the estimated
cost of (1) the main in excess of the 100 feet of main for which no CIAC is required and (2) the
service line in excess of the 100 feet of service line for which no CIAC is required for new customers
occupying existing structures. (For proposed new subdivision, the allowances for extensions of
mains and service lines should be considered only for existing structures that plan to use gas at the
time the main is to be extended.) Any CIAC shall be the lesser of (1) the CIAC calculated in the
feasibility test or (2) the full cost of extending the lines beyond the initial allowances of 100 feet of
main and service line. The aforementioned feasibility test shall include all costs directly associated
with the service extension. The City may waive this requirement at its discretion on a case by case
basis.
h. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (g) of this section, the City will perform a
feasibility test to determine whether a CIAC is required for all extension of service when the
customer’s request for service does not include the use of gas for either central space heating or
water heating.
Section 11.109 Farm Tap Service.
a. Whenever an applicant requests service which can only be supplied from a high
pressure (above 60 pounds per square inch gauge) main, the City, subject to the results of a
feasibility test, may tap the main, install regulating equipment, and extend its facilities to the delivery
point on the customer’s premises. The customer will provide the City with all necessary rights-ofway
on its premises at no expense to the City. Whether a CIAC is required of the customer prior to
the installation of such facilities will be determined by the results of the feasibility test.
b. For a farm tap customer, a feasibility test shall be performed which includes all costs
less an allowance for the cost of (i) the actual feet of main required to serve the customer, not to
exceed 100 feet, (ii) the actual feet of service required to serve the customer, not to exceed 100 feet,
and (iii) the actual number of meter set(s).
c. Charges for service will be billed on the applicable City rate schedule. All other
terms and conditions of the applicable City rate schedule(s) apply to customers using farm tap
service.
d. Any customer receiving service as the result of the installation of a farm tap customer
shall furnish to the City, at all times and at no cost to the City, a satisfactory and lawful right-of-way
through its premises for the City’s equipment necessary or incidental to the furnishing of service and
shall execute a written right-of-way agreement. The customer may make full use and enjoyment of
the lands and premises included within the right-of-way granted by this paragraph in any manner not
inconsistent with the use and purposes of said land and premises by the City; provided, however, that
the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, shall not construct nor permit to be constructed any
house, structure, or obstruction; nor impound nor permit to be impounded any water on or over the
right-of-way; and the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, further agree that the customer and
11-33
its heirs, successors, and assigns will not change the grade over the pipeline or pipelines in any
manner which will reduce the depth of said pipeline or pipelines.
Section 11.110 Customer’s Equipment.
a. An applicant or customer shall give the City notice prior to installing any customer
equipment (including any equipment which may increase the customer’s load) in the premises to
enable the City to ascertain the feasibility of providing service to such equipment. The City shall
provide information concerning the availability of service (including whether the City can service
the increased load), delivery pressure, meter location, and other information which may be pertinent
to the installation.
b. The customer’s equipment must be installed and maintained in accordance with
approved installation standards and the requirements of applicable local, state, and federal agencies.
All customer equipment shall be maintained by and be the sole responsibility of the customer and/or
owner of the premises.
c. If the customer’s equipment might create a vacuum, back pressure, or any other
condition which in the City’s sole opinion could cause operating difficulties on the City’s system,
a device meeting City’s specifications must be installed and maintained by the customer, at its sole
expense, to protect fully and completely the City’s system.
Section 11.111 Requests to Increase Load.
Residential customers receiving service will be permitted to increase their residential gas
loads at the same premises without the consent of the City. All other customers shall make a request
to the City before increasing their gas loads and before changing the purpose for which they use gas.
The request will be in writing and will specify, at a minimum, the name of the customer, type of
service needed, estimated monthly gas consumption, and the date needed. If, in the City’s sole
opinion, it has the capability to provide the additional or changed gas service without interfering with
its ability to provide service to its other customers, the City will permit the customer to increase

The following schedules are applicable to the service furnished by the electric system. Rates
and charges are on file in the office of the City Clerk and the administrative offices of the utilities
department:
a. Electric residential service.
1. Applicability. For all domestic uses of a residential customer in a separately
metered single-family dwelling unit.
11-36
2. Character of service. Power normally supplied under this rate will be
115/230 volts, single phase, 60 hertz. Three-phase service may be furnished,
where available, if the largest motor is not less than 5 hp. Motor starting
currents must conform to City requirements.
3. Valuable cost adjustment. All bills shall be increased or decreased in an
amount per kwh equal to the fuel cost per kwh of bulk power as determined
by MEAG.
4. Multiple service. Where it is impractical to separately meter each unit, two
or more dwelling units may be served through a single meter. Where this is
done, each kwh block in the monthly rate will be multiplied by the number
of separate dwelling units so served.
b. Security lighting.
1. Availability. To property owners where the low voltage distribution lines of
the City are within 500 feet. Service may be made available to tenants in
accordance with the terms of the contract period.
2. Applicability. Applicable to security lighting on customer property by means
of high pressure sodium luminaries supported by short brackets mounted on
(i) wood poles in the City’s existing distribution system or extension from
this system, or (ii) poles owned by the customer, conforming to standard
specifications and mutually satisfactory to both the customer and the City.
In all cases, the luminary, bracket, and control equipment shall be installed,
owned, and maintained by the City. Where the use of poles other than wood
is desired by the customer, he shall install, own, and maintain the
underground conductors and the risers up the poles. Security lighting service
will be provided only at locations which are accessible to City trucks for
servicing purposes. Original locations of lighting fixtures shall be by mutual
agreement, and any relocation requested by owner after installation is in
operation shall be made at owner’s expense.
Existing vapor luminaries will only be maintained by replacement or bulbs
or photo-electric cells. Any maintenance requirement beyond bulb and
photo-electric cell replacement will result in the removal of the mercury
vapor fixture and the installation of a comparable (lumen output) high
pressure sodium vapor fixture.
Maintenance will be performed as soon as can reasonably be done after
notification of the City by the customer that service has been interrupted.
11-37
Maintenance will be done during regular working hours.
3. Contract period: Three years.
Contract may be canceled by either party on 60 days’ written notice.
However, should the customer cancel the contract during the first 36 months,
he or she shall pay to the City to cover the unamoritized cost of installation
and removal, a sum equal to $1.25 per luminary, per month for each month
remaining in the original 36 month period. Tenants wishing to contract for
this service may be required to make a deposit of $25.00 per lamp. Such
deposit, if required, will be returned on request at the end of the original 36

ARTICLE X. ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
Section 12.111 Purpose and Findings.
a. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses,
including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of
criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is
recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form
of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing
of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the
regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment
establishments and patrons.
b. Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses
on the community presented in hearings and reports made available to the Council and on the
findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986);
Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215
(1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 120 S. Ct.
1382 (2000); and upon studies in other communities including but not limited to: St. Mary’s,
Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; North Hanover County, North Carolina; Garden Grove,
California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier California; Adams County, Colorado; Denver,
Colorado; Manatee County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul,
Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; Las Vegas, Nevada; Cattaraugas County, New York; Islip, New
York; New York City, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas;
Austin, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Cleburne, Texas, El Paso, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas;
Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington; Des Moines, Washington; Seattle, Washington; St.
Croix County, Wisconsin; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General’s Working
Group on The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); and
the Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission of Pornography, the Council finds:
1. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the
establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners
of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
2. Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this Ordinance
as adult theaters and adult dance establishments engage in higher incidence
of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
3. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually
oriented businesses, especially in those which provide private or semi-private
12-29
booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
4. Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates
unhealthy conditions.
5. Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually
oriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex within the premises
of such sexually oriented business.
6. At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in
sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea,
human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes,
hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
7. Since 1981 and to present, there has been an increasing cumulative number
of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency virus caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982;
2,200 in 1983; 4,600 in 1984; and 8,555 in 1985.
8. As of December, 2002 there had been 26,008 reported cases of AIDS in the
State of Georgia making Georgia the ninth highest state in the country for
cumulative AIDS cases.
9. The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States
reports annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982, and 45,200
through November, 1990.
10. The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually
remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in
1990.
11. In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the United States
has advised the American Public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
12. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well
as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
13. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in
part, because of activities conducted there are unhealthy, and in part, because
12-30
of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and
those operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain
those facilities.
14. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the
area of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films.
15. The findings in Subsections (1) through (14) raise substantial governmental
concerns.
16. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should
be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental
concerns.
17. A reasonable licencing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the
burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place
an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run
in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and
employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require
reasonable assurances that the license is the actual operator of the sexually
oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and
activities occurring therein.
18. Removal of the doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on
premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in
curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
19. Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information
regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the
incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors
from working in such establishments.
20. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible
for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented
business, where such information is substantially related to the significant
governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in the preventing
the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
21. In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to
obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may
engage in the conduct which this Ordinance is designed to prevent, or who
12-31
are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
22. The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a
sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may
engage in that conduct in contravention of this Ordinance.
23. The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a
period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to,
the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
24. The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of this City will
be promoted by the enactment of this Ordinance.

Section 15.2 Adoption of Policies.
The city council shall adopt personnel policies governing the relationship between the city
and employees.
Section 15.3 Protection of Whistleblowers.
As used herein, the term “retaliate” or “retaliation” refers to the discharge, suspension, or

by a public employer against a public employee in the terms or conditions of employment for
disclosing a violation of or noncompliance with a law, rule, or regulation to either a supervisor or
government agency.
It is the policy of the City to encourage its employees to disclose activities that are illegal,
or improper, or otherwise detrimental to the City or its officers or employees, and to address written
complaints that allege acts or attempted acts of retaliation, reprisal, interference, threats, coercion
or intimidation against employees or other persons who disclose such activities, and to protect those
who come forward to report such activities.
If an officer or employee suspects another of misuse, misapplication, or misappropriation of
City property or any other fraudulent or illegal acts, he or she may report such conduct, anonymously
if desired, and the reporting individual will be protected against any form of harassment,
intimidation, discrimination, or retaliation by City officers or employees for making such a report
in good faith.
Reports shall be made in writing to the Mayor with a copy to the City Council. The Mayor
shall promptly conduct an investigation into the matters reported. If the reporting individual’s
identity is known, his or her identity may not be disclosed without his or her written consent, unless
the City determines that such disclosure is necessary and unavoidable during the course of the
investigation. In such event, the reporting individual shall be notified in writing at least seven (7)
days prior to such disclosure. Within a reasonable time, but not more than thirty days after receipt
if the report, the Mayor shall complete the investigation and shall make a written report to the City
Council. Such report shall contain the Mayor’s findings and recommendations as to what action, if
any, needs to be taken.
An individual who has made such a report, and who subsequently believes that he or she has
been or is being subjected to acts, attempted acts, or threats of retaliation, reprisal, interference,
coercion, or intimidation of any kind is directed to report immediately such conduct to the Mayor,
who shall investigate such complaints. The reporting individual’s identity shall not disclosed in the
course of this investigation without his or her written consent, unless the City determines that such
disclosure is necessary and unavoidable during the course of the investigation. In such event, the
reporting individual shall be notified in writing at least seven (7) days prior to such disclosure.
Within a reasonable time, but nor more than thirty days after receipt of the report, the Mayor shall
complete the investigation and shall make a written report to the City Council such report shall
contain the Mayor’s findings and recommendations as to what action, if any, needs to be taken.
The City strongly disapproves of and will not tolerate any form of intimidation or retaliation
or other conduct designed to suppress or discourage reports of wrong doing. Any employee who
engages in such conduct will be subject to discipline, including termination, subject to the policies
of the City regarding disciplinary procedures.
If any part of this policy is found to be inconsistent with Georgia’s Whistleblower Protection
statute, codified at O.C.G.A. § 45-1-4, or any other applicable law then such inconsistent provision
shall yield and the applicable law shall govern.

canopy signs placed on the facade of a building by any business will be 150 square feet for one and
two story buildings, or ten percent of the building facade area, whichever is less. Businesses located
on corners will be allowed to exceed this limit as specified in section 18.81.
For each business occupying an entire building, the sign area of any wall sign or canopy signs
placed on a building facade may not exceed ten percent of the building facade area. The building
facade area is calculated by multiplying the height of the facade by the width of the facade and
subtracting the area devoted to windows.
For any building which houses multiple businesses, the building facade area used to calculate
the maximum size of wall and canopy signs allowed for each business will be defined as the
individual business’s linear frontage (on the primary facade) less the area of any window glass, times
the height of the building as measured at its highest point above the business’s frontage.

ground floor frontage. Window signs on the second floor will be limited to identification and
instructional signs which shall cover no more than 15 percent of the entire window area above the
ground floor and no more than 30 percent of any one window.

order, requirements, decision or determination made by an
administrative official in the enforcement of this ordinance.
(b) To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the
terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in
unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice
done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of
18-89
unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board that:
(1) There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining
to the particular piece of property in question because of its
size, shape or topography; and
(2) The application of this ordinance to this particular piece of
property would create an unnecessary hardship; and
(3) Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of
property involved, and not of the making of the applicant; and
(4) Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the
public good or impair the purposes and intent of this
ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be
granted for a use of land or building or structure that is
prohibited by this ordinance.
In exercising the above powers, the board of appeals may, in
conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision or
determination and to that end, shall have all the powers of the officer
from whom the appeal is taken in relation to this ordinance and may
issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
2. Authorization. In hearing and deciding appeals, the board shall have the
authority to grant such variances there from as may be in harmony with their
general purpose and intent, so that the function of this ordinance be observed,
public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done, including the
following:
(a) Interpret the provisions of the ordinance in such a way as to carry out
the intent and purpose of the plan as shown upon the zoning map
fixing the use districts, accompanying and made part of this
ordinance, where street layout actually on the ground varies from the
street layout as shown on the map aforesaid. In case of any question
as to the location of any boundary line between zoning districts the
board shall interpret the zoning map after recommendation from the
planning commission.
(b) Permit the modification of the off-street automobile parking space or
loading space requirements where, in the particular instance, such
modifications will not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of
18-90
such requirements.
(c) Permit such modification of the area regulations as may be necessary
to secure an appropriate improvement of a lot which is of such shape
or so located within relation to surrounding development or physical
characteristics that it cannot otherwise be appropriately improved
without such modification.
(d) Permit temporary buildings and uses for period not to exceed six
months.
(e) Establish performance bonds to insure compliance of any requirement
which may be deemed necessary for approving any variance.
3. Application. The concurring vote of two-thirds of the members of the board
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision or
determination of the building inspector in favor of the applicant in any matter
upon which it is authorized by this ordinance to render a decision.
4. Standards. In consideration of all appeals and all proposed variations to this
ordinance, the board shall, before making any variations from the ordinance
in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variation complies with
the conditions set forth in section 18.281(1); and in addition meets the
following general standards.
(a) The proposed use will be of such location, size and character that it
will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of
the surrounding neighborhood.
(b) The proposed use will be of a nature that will make vehicular and
pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district
involved, taking into consideration vehicular turning movements in
relation to routes of traffic flow, proximity and relationship to
intersections, adequacy of sight distances, location and access of offstreet
parking and provisions for pedestrian traffic, with particular
attention to minimizing child-vehicle contacts in residential districts.
(c) The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation of
any such proposed use will be designed to eliminate any possible
nuisance emanating therefrom which might be noxious to the
occupants of any other nearby permitted uses, whether by reason of
dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights.
18-91
(d) The location and height of buildings or structures and the location,
nature and height of walls and fences will be such that the proposed
use will not interfere with or discourage the appropriate development
and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their
value.
5. Conditions. The board, acting on any appeal in connection with a request for
waiver, may attach any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to
accomplish the reasonable application of the foregoing standards.
In exercising the above powers, the board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may
make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and to
that end, shall have all the powers of the zoning administrator from who the appeal
is taken in relation to this ordinance.
Section 18.282 Approval Period.
No order of the board permitting the erection or alteration of a building shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless such use is established within such period; provided, however,
that where such use permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such order
shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for said erection or alteration is obtained within
such period, and such erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with
such permit.

reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
d. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and
on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening
land, as for park purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined with due

shoulders and slopes shall be improved at the limits of rights-of-way of streets serving residential
lots and the slope of created front lots within a subdivision shall be improved to eliminate major
erosion. Improved driveways and access points, constructed to appropriate grades of drainage
ditches shall be required if lot or street drainage is not controlled by curbs and gutters or other means
approve by the Planning Commission. Lot access points shall be provided with adequately sized
culverts set at a grade to prevent undue flooding. Such lot access points shall be improved to a
minimum width of 18 feet and shall be furnished with a pipe no smaller than 15 inches in size. A

conformance with applicable codes in force within the City, or such ordinances which regulate and
prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain
any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances.
b. The Mayor and Council appoint or designate the Planning and Building Inspection
Official of the City of Blakely or his/her designee(s) as public officer(s) to exercise the powers
prescribed by this ordinance.
c. Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least
five residents of the City charging that any property, dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for
human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and/or is not in compliance with
applicable codes or exists in violation thereof, is vacant and being used in connection with the
commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result
of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the
21-15
specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer determines from investigation or
inspection that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for
commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and
being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the
public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue and
file in the Municipal Court a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on
which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general
nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested
parties for such property, dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject
real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested
parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action, and contain a statement of the action
sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested
parties that a hearing will be held before the Municipal Court at a date and time certain and at a place
within the City where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor
more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in court. The interested parties or any of them
shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer
testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing.
d. If after such notice and hearing the court determines that the dwelling, building, or
structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial,
or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection
with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety
as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, or that there exist on the property other conditions
which are in violation of this ordinances or other relevant ordinances of the City, the court shall state
in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served
upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order:
1. In cases involving structures or buildings on the property, if the repair,
alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be
made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling,
building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the
order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as
to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited
violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used
in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
2. If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or
structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes
relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation
to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the
owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove said
dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of these two sub-paragraphs, the court shall make its
21-16
determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the
dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land
on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the
preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be
considered. The income and financial status of the owner shall not be a
factor in the court’s determination. The present value of the structure and
the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by
affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as
provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43 of the O.C.G.A., qualified building
contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony
presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall
be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the
applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.
3. In cases involving violations other than buildings or structures on the
property, the court shall order the owner or other person before the court to
abate the condition by mowing, cutting, or removal, as the case may be.
No officer or member of the City Council or employee of the City, charged
with the enforcement of this article in the discharge of duties, shall be
rendered liable personally; and such officer, member, or employee is hereby
relieved from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to persons
or property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of
duties under this article.
e. If the owner or other person before the court fails to comply with an order to repair
or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, or to abate the condition, as the case may be, the
public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to
be vacated and closed, and/or demolished, or the conditions existing in violation abated as provided
in said order. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of the
time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is
prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief
granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such
abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance
of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
“This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial,
industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable
codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection
with drug crimes or constitutes and endangerment to the public health
or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or
occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful.”
21-17
f. If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to
salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys
received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the
demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of
sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public
advertisement and bid. The public officer and the City are relieved of any and all liability resulting
from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects
in such salvaged materials.
g. The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees,
administrative costs incurred by the City, and all other costs necessarily associated with the
abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien
against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
1. The lien provided for in the foregoing paragraph shall attach to the real
property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair,
closure, demolition, or other abatement in the Office of the Clerk of the
Superior Court of Early County and shall relate back to the date of the filing
of the lis pendens notice required under Section 21.33 of this chapter. The
Clerk of the Superior Court of Early County, as required by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-
9(b)(1), shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed
records of Early County and shall enter the lien on the general execution
docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except
liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force
until paid.
2. Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance
with this ordinance, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions
under this ordinance shall transfer to the City tax collector a statement of the
total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices
provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be
transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, closure,
or other action. It shall be the duty of the City tax collector to collect the
amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad
valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48 of the Official
Code of Georgia Annotated; provided, however, that the limitation of
O.C.G.A 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before
commencing any tax foreclosure shall not apply. The City tax collector shall
remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the City.
3. Enforcement of liens pursuant to this ordinance may be initiated at any time
following receipt by the City tax collector of the final determination of costs
in accordance with this ordinance. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest
and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the
21-18
same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property
ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-
78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this
chapter.
4. The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this
ordinance shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in
accordance with this ordinance together with interest, penalties, and costs
incurred by the governing authority and/or the City tax collector in the
enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made
in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
5. The City may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the
owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or
municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or
the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the
financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
6. Where the abatement action does not commence in the Superior Court,
review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or
demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the
Superior Court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
7. The public officers designated herein may, in addition to the powers herein
granted, issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes,
option building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and
conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek
to enforce such citation in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing
a complaint in rem as provided in this ordinance.
8. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the
power of the City to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal
or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
Section 21.32 Determination by Public Officer that Under Existing Ordinances
Dwellings, Buildings, or Structures are Vacant and Sample Conditions
of Nuisances.
The public officer may determine, under existing ordinances, that a dwelling, building, or
structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit its current commercial, industrial, or business use
