PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Valley, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2001 Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President, Supplement Department, and Kelly Cribbs, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John Ben Jones III, City Attorney, and Ms. Regina Glaze, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Any and all additions and amendments to this Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the council to make the addition or amendment a part hereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated in this Code, so that reference to the Code shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
(b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section ____________ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Valley, Alabama, is hereby amended to read as follows: ...."

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In the preparation of a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing sections or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 38-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24, Chapter 45, Sections 1-11, Chapter 52, Sections 1-84, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of Valley, Alabama, does ordain as follows. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 1, § A), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Valley, Alabama, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 1, § B), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 1, § C), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-34. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 1, § D), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-35. - Lands to which this article applies. 
    This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Valley, Alabama. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 2, § A), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-36. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated June 26, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for (Chambers County) are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 2, § B), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-37. - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 2, § C), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-38. - Compliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.

Sec. 38-41. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Valley, Alabama, or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 2, § G), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-42. - Penalties for violation.

( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 2, § H), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-43. - Savings clause. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word of this article is for any reason held to be noncompliant with 44 Code of Federal Regulation 59-78, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this article. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 2, § I), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-44. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The planning commission as established by the Valley City Council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court as provided in 1975 Code of Alabama. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
    Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more section, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

d.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Remedy a violation means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local flood plain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Section 1316 [means] no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property which the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted State or local zoning authority or other authorized public body, to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations or ordinances which are intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas. 
    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.

    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

Sec. 38-93. - Floodways. 
(a)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-36, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(3)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of section 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(4)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(5)  Only if subsections 38-93(1)b, c or d, above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 4, § C), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-94. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-36, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (Approximate A-Zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-36, then the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsection (2) and (4) shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in Zone A must meet the requirements of section 38-91 and section subsections 38-92(1) through (4). 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of subsection 38-92(3)(b)(ii) in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet). [Optional] Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 38-91(4) "Elevated buildings." 
    The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
( Ord. No. 2011-01, Exh. 1(Art. 4, § D), 1-24-2011 ) 
Sec. 38-95. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-36, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 38-91(4), "Elevated buildings." 
The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level or two feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 38-72(1)c. and (2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

( Ord. No. 2009-01, § IV, 1-12-2009 ) 
Sec. 46-156. - Wrecker rotation list-Call allocation system. 
    The chief of police shall set up a wrecker rotation system that best meets the needs and best serves the Valley Police Department. The rotation system guidelines are set forth follows: 
(1)  To be eligible for approval to tow in the city or its police jurisdiction, the wrecker operator's place of business and storage facility must be located in Chambers County, however, except that if there are no qualified operators in a particular area, the chief of police may designate qualified out-of-county wrecker operators to be called into that area. 
(2)  Wrecker company operators shall be placed on the rotation list in order of application and will be called for service and for removal o a wrecked, disabled, stolen, impounded or abandoned vehicle according to the operator's placement on wrecker rotation list. 
(3)  The wrecker company must have a wrecker of sufficient size and strength to handle the job. The Valley Police Department reserves the right not to use a wrecker company that, in its opinion, fails to meet this qualification for a specific job. Under these conditions, the wrecker service not called will remain on the top of the rotation list. 
(4)  A wrecker company may respond with a wrecker of a higher class than requested, however, the wrecker company is limited to the rates of the requested classification. 
(5)  A wrecker company may not assign, transfer, pledge, surrender, encumber, or dispose his place on the rotation wrecker list. The wrecker company agrees to respond to all calls requested by the Valley Police Department 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If for any reason an operator cannot respond, he will be logged as unavailable. Operators who refuse to respond or develop a pattern of not responding to calls shall be subject to suspension or removal from the chief of police. 
(6)  In the event the call is an "owners" request, if the department cancels the call or a response is made without rendering service, the wrecker company will not be marked as unavailable on the list. 
(7)  A wrecker company will be listed on each wrecker rotation list only once. This listing will use the name of the wrecker company submitted during the application process and which they were qualified under. 
It is prohibited for a wrecker operator conducting business at one location to receive multiple listings or classifications by utilizing a different or fictitious name for trucks operating from the same location or by utilizing trucks with the same name out of a different location. 
Wrecker companies or corporations operating more that one rotation wrecker business within the same county or city, or in more that one county or city, must maintain completely separate officers, required paperwork, logs and assigned rotation wreckers at the approved location. Each business must have at least one wrecker available for call for each city approved for. 
Attempts to circumvent the intent of the rotation system will result in the removal for a period of not less than five years. 
(8)  When emergency conditions necessitate, the department reserves the right to request the services of the wrecker company or operator who is the best able to handle the emergency and can reach the scene in the shortest time regardless of the operator's position on the rotation list. If a call us made under these circumstances this call will count as that wrecker's next rotation call. 
(9)  Whenever heavy equipment or large vehicles are involved in an accident, and is determined that the wrecker next up in the rotation list does not have adequate to handle the accident, then the department reserves the right to call a large wrecker from an operator on the list that can handle the situation. 
    If a call is made under these circumstances, the operator will be repositioned accordingly. Call for large wreckers will be rotated around the companies having qualified larger wreckers. Having only on large rotation wrecker is not justification for being called to all truck accidents. 
    Example: an overturned truck usually requires more than one wrecker or specialized recovery equipment. The Valley Police Department would call the rotation company capable of solely handing the truck recovery. 
( Ord. No. 2009-01, § V, 1-12-2009) 
Sec. 46-157. - Operations. 
(a)  Wrecker companies will provide to the department a list of all wrecker operator personnel, including their full name, current address, date of birth, driver's license number, and social security number. Each wrecker operator shall be investigated regarding any criminal history. 
    Any criminal history of an operator, which affects the company's qualification for the job shall be grounds for rejection of the wrecker company. 
(b)  The chief of police will conduct an annual review of the records of the wrecker companies and operators on the wrecker rotation list to determine if any convictions of crimes, which would impact on the individual's qualifications to remain on the wrecker rotation list, have occurred since their initial inclusion. In addition to the annual review, the chief of police will conduct random inspections of as many current owner/operator records as manpower and time restrictions will permit. 
(c)  Before any newly hired employee of the wrecker company is allowed to drive a wrecker for any rotation call, the wrecker company who is currently on a wrecker rotation list will furnish the chief of police with a criminal and driver's history of the new employee. The chief of police will notify the wrecker company owner if the new hire us approved upon receipt of said histories. 
(d)  Each company must have the proper business license issued by all applicable governing bodies and provide the Valley Police Department with copies. 
(e)  No wrecker company owner or operator shall be on the rotation list who maintains a reputation in the community of associating with convicted felons, who tolerates or condones gambling the drinking of alcoholic beverages or the use of illicit drugs in or about the business premises; or who allows any other activity that imparts a poor reputation upon the business. 
(f)  No wrecker company employees shall be on the rotation list unless the wrecker company employee is proficient and competent in the operations of the wreckers used. It will be the responsibly of the business owner to ensure that all drivers and wrecker company operators are trained in the safe operation of vehicles and equipment used. Wrecker company operators will be removed form the rotation that demonstrate a lack of proficiency or respond with inadequate equipment. 
(g)  Each wrecker company will furnish the chief of police with one telephone number to be used for requests for service during the day and one telephone number to be used for requests for service during the night or on weekends. Immediate notification shall be made to the chief of police if there is any change in the aforementioned telephone numbers. Call forwarding, which provides immediate contact with the owner/operator, is permitted. Answering services, pager systems or any communications system will be allowed at the discretion of the chief of police. 
(h)  No operator shall proceed to the scene of an accident without being requested to do so by a law enforcement officer or agent of the Valley Police Department, or when requested by a member of his own wrecker company to assist as outlined in these regulations. (This is not to be constructed as sub-contracting). 
    Wrecker company operator shall not solicit business at the scene of an accident. Solicitation shall not include referral for repair/replacement of an auto or referral for any legal service. 
    No wrecker company operator will accept requests for services unless that operator had a vehicle immediately available to perform the requested service 
(i)  No wrecker company operator shall speed, or violate any other traffic laws, or disregard any traffic control device while answering a call, nor upon arrival needlessly congest the scone of the wreck. 
(j)  Wreckers dispatched must arrive to the scene within 30 minutes. If the time to reach the scene exceeds the above limits, and the wrecker company does not notify the Valley Police Department dispatcher of a valid reason for a delay with the said time, a second wrecker may be requested. Of the second wrecker is requested before the arrival of the first rotation wrecker, the initially requested wrecker will forfeit the call and will immediately leave the collision/incident scene. 
(k)  Repeated tardiness will result in suspension or removal from the Valley Police Department Wrecker Rotation list. 
(l)  Additional requirements: 
(1)  The investigating officer at the scene of a collision had the right to designate which vehicle will be towed by a certain wrecker. The wrecker operator first on the scene may have first choice of vehicle unless other wise directed by the officer. 
(2)  At no time shall any tow truck exceed its manufacturer's GVWR or the manufacturer's rated capacity for the towing assembly, not be attached to a vehicle which by its size and/or weight would male towing said vehicle an unsafe movement. 
(3)  It shall be the responsibilities of the wrecker company to perform a general clean-up of the accident area before leaving the scene of any accident. This responsibility requires the wrecker company to remove all debris such as broken glass, liquids, and materials from an accident area by sweeping up such debris and removing this material from the scene. 
(4)  Each wrecker company shall be responsible for securing personal property in a vehicle at an accident scene. The wrecker company shall be responsible for preserving personal property in a vehicle towed from an accident scene. 
(5)  Any officer acting in his official capacity may direct the wrecker company operator to take the vehicle being towed to the Valley Police Department facility or designated facility for examination in furtherance of an official investigation. This may include multiple vehicles towed by different companies to be stored at one wrecker facility. In this case the towed vehicles will be taken to and stored at the facility of the first operator to arrive on the scene unless otherwise directed by the investigating officer. 
(6)  All towing and recovery services who tow and store vehicles which have been abandoned upon a highway, will abide by the requirements as stated in 32-13-1 thru 8, Code of Alabama, 1975 and all applicable Revenue Codes. 
Vehicles towed and stored under these circumstances will be disposed of with 180 days of initial storage. Towing and recovery services will notify the Valley Police Department immediately of the sale of any abandoned vehicles. 
Subcontracting is prohibited: Rotation wreckers may not subcontract wrecker calls. This includes on scene operations. In the event the on scene rotation wrecker is unable to handle the towing operation, the officer will cancel that wrecker and a rotation wrecker capable of handling the operation will be called.

(2)  The city incurs certain expenses or costs in so providing such police and other protection, service and supervision and that such costs are reasonable. 
(3)  The city has, pursuant to its Ordinance No. 81-5, amending the city's Ordinance No. 80-02, heretofore levied certain privilege or license taxes, parallel to the state sales tax, on persons engaged in certain businesses in the police jurisdiction, and certain excise taxes, parallel to the state use tax, on persons storing, using or consuming certain personal property in the police jurisdiction, all as enumerated in Ordinance No. 80-02, as amended by Ordinance No. 81-5. 
(4)  The proceeds heretofore derived by the city from the levy of the privilege or license and excise taxes:

c.  Have therefore been reasonably related to such expenses or costs.

(7)  This division is being adopted, and the privilege or license and excise taxes authorized in this division are being levied, as a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power of the city in providing police and other protection, service and supervision to persons in the police jurisdiction subject to such taxes, and not for the purpose of raising general revenue.

(1)  The taxpayer has the right to receive a clear and simple written description of his role and the examiner's role during an audit or examination before the audit or examination proceedings begin. 
(2)  The taxpayer has the right to a written description of the basis for any preliminary assessment, the basis for any penalty imposed by the taxing jurisdiction regarding any preliminary assessment, and a method describing how the taxpayer can request an administrative review of any preliminary assessment. 
(3)  The taxpayer has the right to receive a written description of how to exercise his right of appeal to the taxing jurisdiction's administrative law division or to circuit court at or before the issuance of a final assessment.

(c)  Roles of the examiner and taxpayer during an audit. In most cases, a taxing jurisdiction has three years from the date a tax return is due or filed, whichever is later, to audit the taxpayer's tax return and send the taxpayer a notice of any change in the amount of the tax, penalty, and interest the taxpayer may owe, or notify the taxpayer of any refund owed to him. Under certain circumstances, the time limitations to audit tax returns may be extended. These are if: 
(1)  The taxpayer signed an agreement with the taxing jurisdiction to extend the time period to adjust his tax return. 
(2)  The taxpayer omitted more than 25 percent of the taxes that he should have reported on his tax return. 
(3)  The taxpayer intentionally misstated or fraudulently filed his tax return.

When the appointment is made, the examiner will notify him in writing as to the necessary books and records required for the audit. 
(2)  Throughout any examination process, the taxpayer may represent himself, or, with proper written authorization, he may elect to have an authorized representative act on his behalf. When he meets with the examiner the taxpayer has the right to have an authorized representative present, or the authorized representative may represent him in his absence. In order for this representative to act on his behalf, the taxpayer must, prior to his audit appointment, sign a power of attorney and declaration of representative form, or such other form such as a federal power of attorney form, which designates the taxpayer as the "taxpayer," identifies the type of tax or assessment, identifies the taxpayer's authorized representative, and states the effective date of representation. To obtain a power of attorney form, the taxpayer may call Local Governments Revenue Enhancement Consultants, Inc. at 256/751-0692, or write to LGREC, P.O. Box 1324, Hartselle, Alabama 35640. 
(3)  If the taxpayer wishes, he may audio record any in-person interview with the examiner, provided that the taxpayer notifies the examiner at least 24 hours prior to the interview. Likewise, the examiner may audio record an in-person interview with the taxpayer, provided the examiner notifies the taxpayer at least 24 hours prior to the interview or if the taxpayer has arranged to audio record the interview. In order to obtain a copy of any transcript or audio recording made by the examiner, the taxpayer must make a written request and pay the established fee. 
(e)  After the audit. 
(1)  After a taxpayer's audit, one of the following three actions will be taken: 
a.  Accept the tax return as filed; 
b.  Issue a preliminary assessment which will state any additional tax, penalty, and interest the city believes the taxpayer owes; or 
c.  Issue a refund of tax and any applicable interest to the taxpayer. 
(2)  If any charges are proposed to the taxpayer's tax return, the examiner will explain the reason. The taxpayer should inquire about anything that is unclear to him. 
(3)  If the taxpayer does not agree with the decision in his case, he may appeal the decision by filing a written petition for review to request a conference on his case.

To request a petition for review form, the taxpayer may call Local Governments Revenue Enhancement Consultants, Inc. at 256/751-0692 or write to LGREC, P.O. Box 1324, Hartselle, Alabama 35640. 
(4)  The taxing jurisdiction will review the taxpayer's petition and schedule a conference if requested or otherwise necessary. 
(5)  During this conference the taxpayer will have the opportunity to discuss his case with a designated hearing officer from the taxing jurisdiction. This conference will allow both the taxpayer and the examiner to present each side of the issue and to review any additional information being presented. 
(6)  Based on the outcome of this conference, the taxing jurisdiction will either cancel, change, or affirm the action. If the taxpayer does not timely file his petition for review or the taxing jurisdiction determines from the conference that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the taxing jurisdiction will enter a final assessment. 
(7)  If a final assessment is entered, the taxpayer will be notified in writing and advised that he may appeal either to the taxing jurisdiction's administrative law judge or to the circuit court.

(1)  Driving a motor vehicle on the public streets and highways is a privilege, not a right. 
(2)  Of all drivers involved in fatal accidents, a driver with a suspended license is more likely to be involved in a fatal accident than a properly licensed driver. 
(3)  Alabamians who comply with the law are frequently victims of traffic accidents caused by unlicensed drivers. These innocent victims suffer considerable pain and property loss at the hands of people who flaunt the law. 
(4)  It is necessary and appropriate to take additional steps to prevent unlicensed drivers from driving. The city has a critical interest in enforcing its traffic laws and in keeping unlicensed drivers from illegally driving. Seizing the motor vehicles used by unlicensed drivers serves a significant governmental and public interest, namely the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city from the harm of unlicensed drivers who are involved in a disproportionate number of traffic incidents, and the avoidance of the associated destruction and damage to lives and property. 
(5)  This section is consistent with the due process requirements of the United States Constitution and the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 94 S. Ct. 2080, 40 L.Ed.2d 452 (1974). 
(b)  (1)  a. If a driver is unable to produce a valid driver's license on the demand of a law-enforcement officer, the motor vehicle is subject to impoundment regardless of ownership, unless the law-enforcement officer is reasonably able, by other means, to verify that the driver is properly licensed. Prior to impounding the motor vehicle, a law-enforcement officer shall make a reasonable attempt to verify the license status of a driver who claims to be properly licensed, but who is unable to produce the license on demand of the law-enforcement officer. A notation of the officer's attempt to verify that the driver is properly licensed shall be noted on the departmental report. The driver and occupants of the motor vehicle will be transported to a place of safety by the impounding officer or arrangements made for transportation, and a vehicle-impound report made with a full inventory of items in the motor vehicle. 
b.  A law-enforcement officer shall not impound a motor vehicle pursuant to this section if the license of the driver expired within the preceding 60 days and the driver would otherwise have been properly licensed. 
c.  If the owner of the motor vehicle or another family member of the owner is present in the motor vehicle and has a valid license, the motor vehicle shall not be impounded and towed. 
d.  If there is a medical necessity jeopardizing life or limb, the law-enforcement officer may elect not to impound the motor vehicle. 
e.  A law-enforcement officer who requests that a motor vehicle be towed onto the property of another pursuant to this section shall do so by using a vehicle impound report. 
(2)  A motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall be released if the person redeeming the motor vehicle satisfies in full the fees provided for by subsection (d) and: 
a.  The registered owner appears at the Valley Police Department or a representative of the owner with written notarized authorization from the registered owner appears, and presents a valid driver's license and a copy of the written authorization, if applicable, to be copied by the Valley Police Department; 
b.  If the registered owner does not have a valid driver's license, he or she may bring someone with them who has a verified valid license and the motor vehicle may be released without written notarized permission; or 
c.  Upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(c)  Any owner of a motor vehicle (including a lien holder, person with a security interest in the motor vehicle, a lessor of the motor vehicle, assignee of the lessor, or the person who is the registered owner of the motor vehicle) who suffers any loss due to the impoundment of any motor vehicle pursuant to this section may recover the amount of the loss from the driver who was unable to produce a valid driver's license at the request of the law-enforcement officer. 
(d)  The person redeeming the motor vehicle from the automobile dealer, wrecker service owner, repair service owner, or person, firm, or governmental entity on whose property the motor vehicle was lawfully towed at the written request of a law-enforcement officer pursuant to this section will be responsible for paying the fees for the removal and any storage of the motor vehicle. 
(e)  If a motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this section is not redeemed or claimed pursuant to this section within 60 days of the date that it is impounded, then the automobile dealer, wrecker service or repair service owner, or any person, firm, or governmental entity on whose property the motor vehicle was lawfully towed at the written request of a law-enforcement officer pursuant to this section may sell the motor vehicle at public auction according to the state law governing abandoned motor vehicles in Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 32-13-1 through 32-13-8, as now exist or are hereafter amended. 
(f)  Information about any motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this section by a law-enforcement officer of the city, including the date of impoundment and the vehicle identification number, will be made publicly available on the city's web site by the Valley Police Department within five days after impoundment. This information will be made available to assist those with a legal interest in the motor vehicle, but the failure to post such notice will not make the impoundment unlawful.

between the applicant and the appropriate water authority, which
agreement shall specify that the applicant shall assume the
responsibility for purchasing and having installed such fire
hydrants as required by the appropriate fire department, and that
the applicant shall agree to pay the annual rental therefore, and
such other charges that may be levied by the water authority for
9
a period of three (3) years from the date of their installation. Such
agreement shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for his
and the fire departments approval, and shall be in full force and
effect at the time of the issuance of any building permit provided
for there under.

ready for occupancy or use, it shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator of the City to
make a final inspection thereof, to issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the building or
premises are found t conform with the provisions of this Ordinance and other applicable
regulations or, if such certificate is refused, to notify such applicant in writing of the
refusal and the cause or causes therefore.
1.4. Expiration of Building Permit. Any permit under which no construction work has
been done above the foundation wall or other foundation support within six (6) months
from the date of issuance shall expire by limitation, but shall upon reapplication be
renewable, subject, however, to the provisions of all ordinances in force at the time of
said renewal. In no event shall any permit be renewed more than one time.
1.5. Unlawful Structure. Any uses of land or dwellings or construction or alteration of
buildings, or structures erected, altered, razed or converted in violation of any of the
provisions of this Ordinance are hereby declared to be a nuisance per se. The Zoning

or premised has been adapted to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.
1.6. Fees. Where work for which a permit is required by this Ordinance is stated or
proceeded with prior to obtaining a permit, the building permit fee shall be doubled, but
the payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person from having to fully comply

penalties prescribed in this Ordinance.
1.7. Penalties. Any person, firm, corporation, or other organization which violates any
provision of this Ordinance shall be fined upon conviction not less than one dollar

land is used in violation of this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator of the City or any
other appropriate authority or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be
damaged or caused hardship by such violation, in addition to other remedies, may
institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to stay or
prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair,
conversion, maintenance or use, to correct or abate such violation or to prevent
occupancy of such building, structure or land.
1.9. City Not Subject to Ordinance. Any provision of the Ordinance to the contrary not

ARTICLE VIII
TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES
Section 1.0. Purpose.
In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while
protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, these
regulations are necessary in order to (1) facilitate the provision of wireless
telecommunications services to the residents and businesses of the City; (2) minimize
adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and citing standards; (3) avoid
potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards
and setback requirements; and (4) encourage and maximize the use of existing and
approved towers, buildings and other structures to accommodate new wireless
telecommunications antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the
community.
Section 2.0. Applicability.
This Article shall apply to antennas, towers and other supporting structures which are
integral to the principal use of the premises or which are a separate business from the
principal use of the property, including, but not limited to: commercial radio and
television transmission antennas, television receiving antennas for cable television
systems, telecommunications antennas, and other antennas which are not an accessory
use of the premises. All such uses shall be a special exception use, except the following
uses which shall be a permitted use in all zoning districts.
A. Installation of antennas on existing towers where the tower height is not
increased and all accessory structures and uses are located within the
existing tower compound.
B. Installation of antennas on power poles where the height of the pole is not
increased and accessory cabinets and boxes have a volume of less than two
cubic feet.
C. Installation of antennas owned by public utilities which are accessory to:
remote terminal units serving pad mounted switch gear, remote switch
controllers and similar telemetry antennas; provided the antenna is attached
to a power transmission or distribution pole and does not exceed the height
of the pole, or the antenna is attached to a building and does not extend
more than ten (10) feet above the roof line of the building or the antenna is
ground mounted and does not exceed twenty (20) feet in height. Said
88
antennas shall also be exempt from the permitting requirements of Section
10 of this Article.
D. Installation of antennas which are accessory to Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition facilities located within a electric power sub-station,
provided the antenna does not exceed the height of the poles or sub-station
structure. Said antennas shall also be exempt from the permitting requirements
of Section 10 of this Article.
E. Installation of antennas on concealment structures, except concealment
towers, where the antenna is not visible from off the premises and the
accessory cabinet has a volume of less than 40 cubic feet or is not visible
from off the premises.
F. Installation of antennas on buildings which comply with all of the following
conditions:
1. The building is not located in a single family residential district.
2. The property is not subject to a special exception use, variance or other
zoning restriction which exceeds the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance.

is located where it is not visible from off the premises.
Section 3.0. Availability of Suitable Existing Towers or Other Structures.
No new towers, which are a special exception under the terms of this Article, shall be
permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the City that
no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicants needs.
Section 4.0. Principal Uses to be on Lots.
All telecommunication towers and other supporting structures which are not an integral
part of the principal use of the premises shall be the principal use of the premises on
which they are located and shall be located on a separate lot. Because of the unique
nature of these structures, said lots shall be exempt from the requirement to have
principal frontage upon a public street, any minimum lot area or width requirements and
any setback requirements of the zoning district where they are located. However, the lot
for any telecommunications tower shall be large enough to accommodate the tower and
89
accessory structures of the applicant, as well as the accessory structures of at least one
additional co-locating service provider.
Section 5.0. Setbacks.
Towers shall be placed no closer than a distance equal to the height of the tower from any
dwelling located in the FAR, RR, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5 or PDD zoning districts.
However, because of the unique nature of telecommunications facilities, other required
setbacks from property lines shall be determined on an individual basis by the Board of
Adjustment as part of the special exception process. The Board shall consider the
following factors when establishing minimum setbacks.
A. The type of telecommunications facility
B. Relationship to other properties and buildings
C. Relationship to the public right-of-way

applicable FAA standards, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual
obtrusiveness
.
B. The design of the buildings and accessory structures and uses shall, to the
extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping
that will blend the telecommunication facilities to the natural setting and
built environment.
C. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and
accessory uses and structures must be of a color that is identical to, or
closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make
the antenna and related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible.
D. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other
applicable authority. If lighting is required, the City may review the
90
the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause
the least disturbance to the surrounding views. Lighting must be shielded
or directed to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the amount
of light that falls onto nearby properties, particularly residences.
E. No portion of any antenna array may extend beyond the property line.
F. Accessory buildings, cabinets and structures shall not exceed sixteen (16)
feet in height, and shall be compatible with the surrounding area.

All towers and antennas must meet or exceed the current standards and regulations of the
FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to
regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Article shall bring such towers and
antennas into compliance with such standards and regulations within six (6) months of
the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance
schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute
grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owners expense.
Section 8.0. Building Codes and Safety Standards
The owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards
contained in applicable local building codes, the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended, and all applicable codes

antennas and any power lines, unless more clearance is required to
meet Alabama Public Service Commission standards.
91
4. All towers and telecommunications facilities must be designed and/or
sited so that they do not pose a potential hazard to nearby residences or
surrounding properties or improvements. Any tower shall be designed
and maintained to withstand without failure, the maximum forces
expected from wind, hurricanes, and other natural occurrences, when
the tower is fully loaded with antennas, transmitters, and other
telecommunications facilities, and camouflaging. Initial demonstration
of compliance with this requirement shall be provided via submission
of a report to the Zoning Administrator prepared by a structural
engineer licensed in the State of Alabama describing the tower
structure, specifying the number and type of antennas it is designed to
accommodate, providing the basis for the calculations done, and
documenting the actual calculations performed. Proof of ongoing
compliance shall be provided via submission to the Zoning
Administrator at least every five years of an inspection report prepared
by an Alabama registered structural engineer indicating the number
and types of antennas and related telecommunications equipment
actually present, and indicating the structural integrity of the tower.
Based on this report, the Zoning Administrator may require repair of,
or if a serious problem exists, removal of the tower or any
telecommunications facilities.
B. If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower fails to comply with such
codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then
upon notice being provided to the owner of a tower, the owner shall have
thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If
the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30)
days, the governing authority may remove such tower at eh owners expenses.

All applicants shall comply with federal standards for a radio frequency emission. Within
six (6) months after the commencement of any operations utilizing a tower, antenna or
related telecommunications facilities, the applicant shall submit a project implementation
report which provides cumulative field measurements of radio frequency emissions of all
antennas installed at the subject site, and which compares the results with established
federal standards. If, upon review, the City finds that the facility does not meet federal
standards, the City may require corrective action within a reasonable period of time, and
if not corrected, may require removal of the telecommunications facilities. Any
reasonable costs incurred by the City, including reasonable consulting costs to verify
compliance with these requirements, shall be paid by the applicant.
Section 10.0 Permits.
Except as specifically exempted in section 2.0 of this Article, towers, antennas and
telecommunications facilities are considered structures, requiring issuance of a building
permit. In addition to any information required pursuant to Article III, Section 1.0 in

been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of the
zoning districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to
conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land
throughout the City.
The objectives are achieved by requiring measures to make incompatible land uses more
compatible by requiring a buffer between the uses and to provide shade within and
enhance the appearance of parking and other vehicle maneuvering areas.
Section 2.0. Landscaping Plan

application, special exception application and variance application for new
construction which must provide a buffer or which contains a parking or vehicle
maneuvering area as defined in the Article, and shall contain the following information:
A. The boundaries of all tree areas and a description of the plant material
therein.
B. The location and dimension of all areas proposed for buffers, landscaping
and planting, including a description of the proposed plant materials.
101
C. All dimensions and distances, property lines, easements, right-of-way and
buffers.

of Article VI. If proposed development activity requires a buffer, a Landscaping Plan,
shall be submitted pursuant to the requirements of this Article.
3.2. Standards. In order to decrease incompatibility between neighboring land uses, the
following standards shall apply to all buffers required by the Zoning Ordinance.
A. The buffer shall provide a visually impervious barrier, uniformly dense at all
heights from the ground, and a minimum of five (5) feet above grade
throughout the entire length of the planting strip. The entire surface area of
the buffer shall be planted as prescribed in this Section. Within one year
after installation the buffer shall be at least six (6) feet above grade throughout
the entire length of the planting.
B. Privacy walls or fences, if incorporated in the buffer, shall be visually
impervious, at least six (6) feet high, and shall be used in conjunction with
landscaping materials which compliment the purpose of the required buffer.

The location of the fence or wall within the buffer shall be approved by the
City.
C. All walls and fences located within buffer areas shall be finished on the
exterior viewed from adjacent properties in the same type finish as the
interior portion. All walls and fences shall be maintained in perpetuity by
the owner.
102
D. Public utilities and storm drainage facilities may be constructed in a required
buffer, provided the buffer is installed in compliance with the approved
Landscape Plan. The City may require supplemental plant material in order
to mitigate the effect of land disturbance in the buffer.
E. The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement
of all landscaping materials required by this Section. All plant material shall

ADMENDMENTS TO ORDINANCE 2005-12
BE IT ORDAINED by the City Council of the City of Valley, Alabama:
ORDINANCE 99-07, Valley Zoning Ordinance, as may have been previously
amended, is hereby further amended to add, revise or delete the following:
Temporary Emergency Relief (To be added to ordinance)
The Zoning Administrator is hereby granted authority to provide immediate and temporary relief
to applicants requesting such relief, by issuing permits authorizing installation of temporary
manufactured homes on applicants property under the following conditions:
 Such permit shall be temporary and not exceed six (6) months from date of issuance, or
until a replacement home has been issued a certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs
first.
 Such permit shall not be transferable.
 Prior to issuance of such permit, the Zoning Administrator shall, in his discretion, be
reasonably satisfied that the applicants requested relief is necessary and the need
therefore was proximately caused by damage resulting from fire or natural disasters.
 Said temporary manufactured home shall be used exclusively as the temporary
domicile of the household affected by the fire or natural disasters only during the time
required to reconstruct or replace the original dwelling.
 Once the replacement home has been constructed and occupied, the temporary
manufactured home shall be permanently removed from the property not more than
thirty (30) days from the date that the Certificate of Occupancy was issued for the
replacement home.
 The temporary manufactured home shall comply with all applicable minimum
standards for dwellings that may be prescribed by the subject zoning district.
Speculative Rezoning (To be added to ordinance)
The City of Valley discourages the use of rezoning as a strategy to increase speculative land
value, where the applicant has no actual or immediate intent to develop in accordance with the
106
rezoning. Rezoning is intended to grant the applicant an opportunity to exercise appropriate
alternative development options in situations where development in compliance with existing
zoning is not possible or practicable, as long as the proposed uses are consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and the character of the surrounding area. The granting of this privilege by
the City carries with it a good faith expectation that the proposed development will occur in a
timely and deliberate manner. Therefore, when the City Council grants approval of a rezoning,
the applicant should acquire a zoning permit or final plat approval (whichever is applicable) and
commence construction activities in compliance with that permit or approval within one (1) year
of the date upon which the rezoning is approved. If such actions have not been taken within the
specified time frame, the Planning Commission may initiate actions to further rezone the subject
property and/or reinstate the original zoning classification.
Temporary Land Uses (To be added to ordinance)
Temporary uses, as set forth below, are declared to possess characteristics which require
certain controls in order to insure compatibility with other uses in the districts within which
they are proposed for location. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a Temporary
Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any of the following temporary uses.
 Carnival, circus or fair in any commercial district, for a period not to exceed twenty
one (21) days, subject to the approval of the City Council.
 Religious meetings in a tent or other temporary structure in any district, for a period
not to exceed twenty one (21) days.
 Open lot sale of Christmas Trees in any district for a period not to exceed Forty-five
(45) days.
 Real estate sales office in any district, for a period not to exceed one (1) year,
provided that such office is placed on the property to which it is appurtenant.
 Carnivals, fairs or special events sponsored or cosponsored by the City of Valley or
Chambers County Board of Education.
 Other temporary uses are subject to the approval of the City Council.
 All Temporary Certificates of Zoning Compliance may be renewed, provided that it
is determined that said use is clearly of a temporary nature, will cause no traffic
congestion, and would not create a nuisance to surrounding uses.
Access to Streets (Revised)
 A point of access, i.e., a drive or other opening for vehicles onto a street, shall
not exceed thirty (30) feet in width, but if the street is a major street and
freeways, or arterial street, the width shall not exceed fifty (50) feet.
 There shall be no more than two points of access to any one public street on a lot
of any width, unless required by the Board of Adjustments to provide adequate
access to lots with more than four hundred (400) feet of continuous street
107
frontage. Lots less than one hundred (100) feet in width shall have no more than
one access to any one public street.
 No point of access shall be allowed within fifty (50) feet of the right-of-way of
any public street intersection. However, a lesser distance may be recommended
for approval to the Board of Adjustments by the Zoning Administrator, where
conditions at the intersection or the constraints of the property may so warrant,
and where such adjustment shall not compromise traffic safety or contribute to
traffic congestion.
 The area existing between the street and an interior parking space or driveway
parallel to the street shall have a curb at least six (6) inches in height and six (6)
inches in width separating the parking area and drive from the public right-ofway,
to prevent encroachment of vehicles onto the right-of-way area.
 No curbs on city streets or rightsof-way shall be cut or altered without written
approval of the Zoning Administrator. All points of access to a public street shall
require written approval of the Zoning Administrator.
Fences and Walls (Revised)
 Height on residential properties. Fences or walls that divide the front yard of a house
from the adjoining street shall not exceed a height of four (4) feet. In the case of a corner
lot, fences or walls that divide the front and adjoining side yard of the house from the
adjoining streets shall not exceed a height of four (4) feet. Within any residential district
no wall or fence located within the rear or side yards, shall exceed a height of six and
one half (6 ½) feet, except as required for a retaining wall or tennis court.
 Appropriate materials. Fences and walls shall be constructed of a durable material such
as treated lumber, brick, chain link or equal materials and be attractive in appearance.
Barbed wire fencing shall be allowed in FAR  Forestry, Agriculture and Recreational
District and only in the rear and side yards of RR  Rural Residential Districts. Razor
wire shall not be permitted as part of any wall or fence, except by special exception of
the Board of Adjustments within a M1 or M2 Industrial District, where special measures
are clearly required to secure the property from public intrusion.
 Fences near roadways. No fence or wall may be erected in the public right-of-way or
within twelve (12 ) feet of the edge of a street or curb except by special exception where
special measures are clearly required. No fence, structure or planting shall obstruct
visibility of persons operating vehicles in the public right-of-way.
Adopted and Approved this the ____ day of September 2005.

2.0 SITE PLANNING AND DESIGN
2.1 GENERAL
8
Site planning shall be governed generally by the City of Valleys Zoning Ordinances (hereinafter, "ZOs") and by the applicable standards for civil engineering design. Areas of special consideration for design approval by the DRB, as outlined within these Standards, may exceed or be more restrictive than the ZOs.
2.2 PERMITTED USES
(A) Permitted Uses and/or Conditional Uses:
Uses shall be those within the underlying zoning districts as permitted by the City of Valley. No use shall be permitted in the overlay district that is not permitted in the underlying zoning districts. Conditional uses shall be those permitted in the underlying zoning districts.
(B) Accessory Uses:
Uses shall be those permitted in underlying zoning districts.
(C) Dimensional Regulations:
All dimensional regulations (except for building setbacks and buffers as required by these Standards) shall be governed by the underlying zoning district.
2.3 EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS
Site design and construction for individual parcels shall interface properly with existing public and private improvements, and shall not cause any negative affect on their appearance, function, condition, or maintenance.
2.4 PERIMETER LANDSCAPE BUFFERS
Perimeter landscape buffers are required for all parcels, and within the FJDGC these may exceed setbacks, buffers, and landscape requirements set forth by the ZOs. The perimeter landscape buffers shall serve as the minimum setbacks for parking lots, pavement areas, structures and other site improvements other than those specifically required or allowed by these Design Standards and the ZOs, which include driveways and sidewalks that connect the parcel to public rights-of-way; signage structures; utilities and utility features; landscaping; irrigation; approved walls, entry features, and frontage elements; and other ancillary features specifically approved by the DRB. Utility easements may be contained within some perimeter landscape buffers. Dimensions specified below are minimums and may be exceeded at the Parcel Developer's option. Buffers are measured perpendicularly from the property lines.
(A) Front Landscape Buffer: This dimension, which varies as defined below, is measured from the ROW of Fob James Drive, and from the ROW of any primary street from which the parcel is accessed. The primary objective is to provide a frontage landscape treatment along the "public face" of each parcel, and to buffer parking areas from public roads within the FJDGC, which contributes to the unified identity of the corridor overlay zone.
9
(i) Where any parking area between FJD or other primary street is no more than 70 wide and/or comprises no more than two parallel rows of parking spaces, the Front Landscape Buffer shall be a minimum of 25.
(ii) Where any parking area between FJD or other primary street is more than 70 wide and/or comprises more than two parallel rows of parking spaces, the Front Landscape Buffer shall be a minimum of 35.
(B) Rear Landscape Buffer: The primary objective for this area is to provide a landscape buffer between adjacent sites. The Rear Landscape Buffer shall be 10 feet, measured from the rear property line. This 10 foot dimension may be reduced 50% to five (5) feet with the provision of a six (6) foot tall wall or fence of design and materials approved by the DRB. Acceptable materials include solid prefabricated PVC; conventional masonry with brick veneer, cultured stone, and/or stucco; concrete panel wall systems; and other treatments approved by the DRB.
(C) Side Landscape Buffer: The primary objective for this area is to provide a landscape buffer between adjacent sites. The Side Landscape Buffer shall be 10 feet, measured from the side property line.
The perimeter landscape buffers shall be appropriately landscaped in accordance with objectives outlined in Section 6.0, Landscaping and Irrigation.
Where any commercial use abuts any residential use, a minimum six (6) foot high masonry or concrete panel wall shall be provided by the Parcel Developer of the commercial site. The wall shall be located within the required landscape buffer; the landscape requirements of Section 6.0 shall apply as well. The wall shall be design and detailed to provide consistency of theme, materials, and colors with the architecture of the site, and the design shall be subject to approval by the DRB.
2.5 BUILDING SETBACKS
Building setbacks within the FJDGC may exceed the ZOs, in order to enhance and preserve the open space character of the overlay zone.
10
(A) All buildings shall maintain a minimum setback of one hundred (100) feet from the right-of-way limits of FJD and fifty (50) feet for intersecting streets within FJDGC, or more based on building size, per the following chart:

No temporary facilities shall remain more than fourteen (14) days after the date of completion of the building(s) for which they were used unless written permission is granted by the DRB.
3.0 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
3.1 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN OBJECTIVES
13
The architectural design objectives of these Standards include the aesthetic enhancement of the FJDGC through the reflection of pride in the City of Valleys history and architectural heritage. As a major gateway to the City, Fob James Drive offers the opportunity to reinforce a strong sense of place by adopting an architectural theme for new development that appropriately reflects this cultural foundation. This approach will impart a sense of quality to the FJDGC, preserving community character, and instilling a sense of history, while encouraging design diversity and variation.
3.2 ARCHITECTURAL THEME
The required architectural theme can be generally defined as Traditional, a term which encompasses many historical American architectural styles such as Colonial, Federal, Georgian, Greek Revival, and Victorian. This Traditional theme offers rich opportunities for architectural character and detailing found in the diversity of commercial, institutional, and residential architecture built throughout the southern United States over at least 150 years. With most of The City of Valleys existing significant historical architecture dating from the 1800s through the 1920s, architects can easily find extensive examples of the architectural theme required by these Standards.
This theme will be required for all new development within the FJDGC and will be applicable to all parcel development. Chain operations and corporate franchises shall be required to adopt this theme to their architectural forms, details, and colors to the same extent as independent Parcel Developers. The DRB will be responsible for review of all development proposals based on its evaluation of the submittals required.

The use of each material shall be a truthful and appropriate expression of the characteristics of that particular material. Colors and textures shall be harmonious and compatible with colors of other buildings in the vicinity and the nearby surroundings. Distracting or incongruous materials, colors, details, accents, or textures shall be avoided.
3.6 ROOFTOP EQUIPMENT
Mechanical equipment on roofs shall be screened with approved materials, so as to be an integral part of the architectural design and to minimize the effect of their appearance on neighboring streets and properties.
3.5 ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING
Architectural lighting is defined as any light fixtures attached to any building or structure. All architectural lighting shall be appropriate for their intended use and effect, and are subject to DRB approval. Fixtures shall reflect a traditional styling consistent with the required architectural theming; contemporary or industrial style fixtures will not be approved. Flood lights are prohibited, and wall packs shall be of a cut-off type in order to not cause distracting glare or have exposed lamps.
Lamping shall be incandescent or high pressure sodium. Metal halide, low pressure sodium, mercury vapor, and fluorescent lighting is prohibited unless specific applications are approved by the DRB. One approved use for metal halide is under canopy lighting for service station canopies, bank drive-through canopies, and commercial arcades; such fixtures may be used only if fully recessed without any protruding lenses or covers.
4.0 SITE LIGHTING
Site lighting is defined as any light fixtures not mounted to a building, including those intended to illuminate parking lots, pedestrian areas, landscaping, buildings, signs, flagpoles, etc. Refer to Section 4.6 and Appendix ______ for specific site lighting poles and fixtures which shall be used.
4.1 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
The parcel developer shall submit for review by the DRB complete plans, specifications, photometric plots and data, and cut sheets for all proposed site
21
lighting, including but not limited to parking and area lighting, landscape lighting, sign lighting, architectural flood lighting, and all other illumination attached to or otherwise part of a building.
Upon completion of lighting installation, the DRB reserves the absolute right to review its operation to ascertain that the lighting was installed as approved, and to direct any corrections on that basis.
4.2 SITE LIGHTING OBJECTIVES
The overall intention of site lighting on individual development parcels in FJDGC is to provide a safe level of nighttime illumination for parking and pedestrian areas, while maintaining a generally consistent level and character of lighting from parcel to parcel throughout FJDGC. The emphasis on all site lighting and of lighting for architectural features and landscaping can be described as a soft glow, as opposed to brilliant or glaring effects. All lighting shall be cut-off typeor downward directedto minimize stray light and impacts of adjacent properties (uplighting for buildings, signage, flagpoles, or landscaping would not be cut-off type, but shall be situated and shielded so as not to allow glare or stray light affecting pedestrians or vehicles).
4.3 TYPE OF LIGHT
All exterior architectural lighting and site lighting of any type shall be incandescent or high-pressure sodium, except as otherwise noted in this document.
The following types of lighting are generally prohibited, unless specifically approved in writing by the DRB:
Metal Halide (except for under-canopy lighting as noted above)
Low Pressure Sodium
Mercury Vapor (except for landscape moonlighting applications)
Fluorescent (except that warm white fluorescent may be used for sign lighting, wall-washing, and similar landscape effects)
Other types of lighting or special effects (e.g., neon) may be approved subject to review by the DRB, and shall be presented in concept prior to the preparation of architectural or engineering plans.
22
4.4 LIGHT LEVELS
Light levels shall be sufficient to provide safety and visibility for users, with the standard allowance being three (3) to three and one half (3.5) footcandles, average. 3.5 footcandles shall be the maximum average for any site. While minimum-to-maximum variations and concentrated hot spots under the fixtures are unavoidable, excessive overall light levels are prohibited to maintain consistency throughout FJDGC.
4.5 PARKING LOT/SITE LIGHTING STANDARDS
The standard light fixture/pole combinations for parking lot and general site lighting shall be as illustrated by the specific models shown in Appendix ______.
For perimeters of parking areas away from buildings, and within parking or paved vehicular areas over 70 wide, the site lighting shall be the bronze-anodized or bronze finish rectangular shoebox, with high-pressure sodium vapor lamping (250 w. to 400 w.), mounted on a matching square bronze-anodized or bronze-finished aluminum, colored cast concrete, or fiberglass pole, at a maximum 30 mounting height. Poles may be situated in paved areas or landscape islands; protective concrete pylon bases in paved areas are allowed but in no case shall unsightly arrangements of protective bollards be approved.
For areas between parking or paved vehicular areas and within the pedestrian zones adjacent to the buildings, the site lighting shall be the specified decorative or themed posts and luminaries which reflect the required architectural theme of FJDGC will be allowed, subject to design approval by the DRB, based on detailed submittals.
4.6 LANDSCAPE LIGHTING
Landscape lighting and building accent lighting is encouraged, although the DRB reserves the right to approve such lighting based on its level, character, and overall effect being consistent with the general appearance desired for FJDGC, characterized by subtle illumination rather than harshness or brilliance. Effects may include up- or downlighting for accent, wall-washing, silhouetting, and moonlighting.
23
Landscape lighting shall utilize fixtures appropriately selected for the setting and effect, and placed unobtrusively in planting areas so as to hide or disguise the light source, and minimize glare or stray light. Only commercial quality fixtures manufactured for long-term durability in the harsh exterior environment will be acceptable.
4.7 SIGNAGE LIGHTING
(Refer to Section 6.0)
5.0 LANDSCAPING AND IRRIGATION
5.1 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
All landscape plans shall be prepared and administrated under the direction of a Alabama licensed Landscape Architect familiar with regional plant material and installation. The submittals shall include all information necessary to determine the installed character of the landscaping and irrigation, as well as any associated improvements, such as grading and landscape lighting. A preliminary submittal is recommended prior to the Final Engineering/Design Documents phase, to establish basic compliance with these standards.
Upon completion of landscape installation, the DRB reserves the absolute right to review the finished planting and to determine whether the completed job meets the form, intent, and quality called for in the approved submittal plans and specifications. Conditions and circumstances that were not indicated by the submittals provided may necessitate additional landscape measures to meet the intent of this document. The parcel developer shall be responsible for contacting the DRB to specifically request a landscape inspection upon completion of the installation. Any deficiencies found by the DRB will be identified in writing and submitted to the parcel developer, who shall then be responsible for immediately taking all corrective action necessary to remedy the deficiencies.
Required Plan Notations: The following notes shall appear on all landscape and irrigation submittal plans.
(A) "Upon completion of the irrigation and landscape installation, the City of Valley or its agent shall inspect the site to determine whether the completed job meets the form, intent, and quality called for in the approved submittal plans and specifications, and whether additional landscape measures may be required to meet these FJDGC Standards, due to conditions and circumstances that were not indicated by the submittals provided. Any
24
deficiencies found by the City will be identified in writing and submitted to the Parcel Developer, who shall then be responsible for immediately taking all corrective action necessary to remedy the deficiencies, prior to issuance by the City of a Certificate of Occupancy.
(B) "The Owner and/or all successors and assigns, shall provide perpetual grounds maintenance to insure generally that: all grounds and landscaped areas shall be kept free of trash, leaves and dead landscape material; all landscaped areas shall be maintained regularly, including trimming, fertilization, mowing, and replacement of diseased, damaged, or dead plant materials as required; all annual/perennial bedding plants shall be replaced to maintain seasonal color; all irrigation systems shall be thoroughly inspected periodically, shall be kept in good repair, and shall be adjusted as necessary to provide continued proper coverage; all parking lots, sidewalks, and other areas shall be swept regularly and otherwise kept free from accumulations of grass clippings, leaves, and other debris; any exterior lighting shall be periodically checked, lamps replaced, and aiming adjusted, as required. No trees shall be topped or unnaturally and abusively pruned at any time, and shall be subject to immediate replacement per the original plan if they were."
5.2 LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
The overall intention of the landscape scheme for FJDGC is to create a simple, unifying landscaped setting with an appropriate sense of scale for the various parcels. The landscape treatment may vary in character to reflect that of the building, site, and setting. The consistency of the landscaping is intended to add an image of quality to FJDGC, and to unite the various parcels through consistency of materials and continuity of frontage design. The expected effect is subject to the aesthetic interpretation of the DRB or their appointed consultant, and the objectives for any site will be discussed at the Pre-Design Conference.
The desired results can be achieved through the use of a limited plant palette with skillfully arranged massing of similar plant materials along street frontages, at vehicular entries, and around buildings. Except within internal courtyards, fussy small-scale residential garden-type landscaping will not be acceptable. Low maintenance and native species are encouraged to reinforce the architectural elements through clean and simple plant massings.
Any plant material which presently exists on the site should be respected during all phases of site design and development. The initial site planning effort should seek to preserve as much existing vegetation as possible through the use of
25
controlled clearing and grading operations, planting space within parking areas, and innovative architectural modification to accommodate specific tree locations. Any damage to existing landscaping or other site improvements, which by approval of the parcel development plans were intended and expected to be preserved from such damage, shall be immediately repaired and replaced to their previous condition at the Parcel Developer's expense, and subject to approval by the DRB.
An Approved Plant Material List has been provided as Appendix A to this document. While additional materials not listed may be approved for use by the DRB, it is intended that through the consistent repeated use of a core group of species, the overall development landscape effect will be unified. Cold tender, high maintenance, and otherwise unsuitable plant materials shall be avoided, except for specific uses such as seasonal bedding plants which will be purposefully replaced.
5.3 LANDSCAPE DESIGN CRITERIA
Every building shall be appropriately and thoroughly landscaped in accordance with these standards and criteria, and in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted to and approved by the DRB. Unimproved property shall be sodded or seeded, if necessary, with grass or wildflowers and properly maintained until the start of construction.
Sites in FJDGC require effective screening via walls or landscaping of all transformers, switchgear, air conditioning equipment, electrical boxes or assemblies, and other such utility gear (see also Section 2.5). The DRB reserves the right to require the provision of additional landscaping, upon inspection of the completed work, for any such utility gear that was not shown on the submittal plans and/or for which the submittal plans did not adequately provide screening.
Site landscape plans shall be designed considering the overall objectives of this section, with specific consideration given to the design elements outlined below. See the Approved Plant Material List (Appendix A) for particular plant species.
See the Approved Plant Material List (Appendix A) for particular plant species recommended for use in landscaping of sites within FJDGC.
26
(A) Shade Trees and Ornamental Trees shall be used as specimens or in groupings for general background planting, shading parking areas, screening, and framing of buildings or views. They may also be used as massed, free-standing elements for spatial effects.
(i) Trees shall be provided on all sites on the basis of one (1) Shade Tree per 4,000 sq. ft. of total site area, or fraction thereof; two (2) Ornamental Trees may be used in lieu of one Shade Tree, for up to a maximum equivalency of 30% of the required Shade Trees. This requirement does not include the required number of buffer trees, as outlined below in Paragraph (iv).
(ii) Of the required trees, a ratio of at least 50% shall be designated Signature Tree species, to create a consistent landscape effect throughout FJDGC. Signature Tree species shall include Live Oak, Magnolia, and Red Maple for Shade Trees, and Dogwood and Crape Myrtle for Ornamental Trees.
(iii) Specific attention shall be given to using trees to shade parking areas and soften the hard effect of such paved areas. A minimum of one (1) Shade Tree or two (2) Ornamental Trees shall be planted in each parking lot island, and every site shall demonstrate attention to trees being located on the perimeters of parking and paved areas to meet this objective.
(iv) Perimeter Landscape Buffers, as required in Section 2.4, shall be planted to contain Shade and Ornamental Trees at the ratio of one (1) Shade Tree or two (2) Ornamental Trees for each fifty (50) linear feet. This requirement is in addition to the trees required by Paragraph (i), above, and Perimeter Landscape Buffers shall also includes shrubs as outlined in Item (C), below.
(v) Shade Trees shall be planted at a minimum size of 3 caliper and 12-14 height.
(vi) Ornamental Trees shall be planted at a minimum size of 30-gallon container and 8-10 height.
(B) Small shade and ornamental species shall be grouped formally or in randomly arranged clusters as foreground plantings. They may also be
27
grouped for accents or other effects requiring seasonal color. Such trees shall be 30 gal. container size or larger.
(C) Shrubs shall be massed for buffering and screening, background, planters, hedges or foundation planting. They may also be used as free- standing elements as low landscape features, but should always be used in significant masses. Shrubs of appropriate size shall be used to provide immediate screening for utility gear, transformers, service areas, loading zones, and/or other areas deemed by the DRB as necessary to be screened.
(i) Perimeter Landscape Buffers, as required in Section 2.4, shall be landscaped to include continuous hedge or massed plantings of shrubs. Plant materials shall be selected to screen and buffer adjacent sites, but allow aesthetic frontage views along FJD. The DRB reserves the right to require subjective landscape buffering provisions where commercial sites abut residential uses, if deemed necessary to increase screening and buffering between such uses. In such cases, more depth, density, and height of plantings may be required.
(ii) Shrubs shall be installed in a minimum size of 3-gallon containers, spaced 3 ft. on center. Height and spread shall be appropriate for each species, but screening of parking areas shall require a minimum installed height of 2 for shrubs. Shrubs shall be sized and spaced are required for individual species, to achieve an acceptable degree of immediate screening for utility gear, loading areas, etc, as described above.
(D) Groundcovers may be used either alone or in combination with other plant material for a massed effect in Perimeter Landscape Buffers, parking lot islands, around buildings, and throughout the site. They should be used on all slopes steeper than 3:1 to aid in erosion control as well as visual appearance.
(E) Annuals and other plants for seasonal color may be used appropriately for entries and feature areas, but shall be kept up on a regular basis if so used.
(F) Turf areas shall be planted with solid sod, interrupted only by paving, trees, or the mulched beds of other plant material. Unless otherwise specifically stated by the DRB, the sod shall extend to the curb or edge of pavement in any and all areas of the site. Annual ryegrass shall be sown in
28
the fall to provide temporary erosion control where necessary, e.g., areas under construction.
(G) Earth mounds are intended to create a soft, gently rolling effect on otherwise flat terrain and are a desired treatment for the frontage areas of FJDGC. They must gradually taper into the surrounding area from a maximum slope of 3:5 and should have softly rounded tops for ease in mowing. Berms or slopes over 3:1 slope shall be planted solid with groundcover. When used repeatedly, mounds should create an irregular natural appearance with variations in both height and width. They are recommended as screening devices, with or without plant material, to lessen the visual impact of service and parking areas. They may also be used where practical in front of setback areas for a soft visual effect. Although the may be used in combination with plant groupings, mounds are to be covered mainly in grass, with only clustered plant or tree groupings emerging.
(H) All plant beds shall be mulched with Pine Straw for a consistent appearance throughout FJDGC. Other mulches, including bark, wood, chips, stone, or synthetic materials shall not be used, unless specifically approved for special circumstances by the DRB.
5.4 LANDSCAPE INSTALLATION STANDARDS
To ensure vigorous growth, and a minimum of maintenance problems, the following minimum standards are to be observed:
(A) Selected plant material shall have a habit of growth that is normal for the species and shall be healthy, vigorous, and meet or exceed the measurements specified as the minimum acceptable sizes.

5.5 IRRIGATION STANDARDS
All landscaped and sodded areas are to be fully irrigated with an automatic irrigation system, excluding those areas specifically excepted by the DRB. To ensure minimum installation standards, the following criteria are to be observed:
(A) The Parcel Developer shall submit plans for review by the DRB showing head locations and types, main lines and lateral line routing, valves, controller(s), water source and/or point of connection to any existing water lines. It shall be the responsibility of the irrigation contractor to adjust the system on the site, and to provide 100% coverage under normal wind conditions.
(B) Piping shall be installed in trenches with a minimum of 12" of cover, except where less cover is required due to existing conditions. The irrigation contractor shall exercise care in digging and work so as not to damage existing facilities; the irrigation contractor shall be responsible for any damage caused by his representatives or his work. Where trenching is required within the dripline of trees to be preserved, this work shall be routed under or around major roots by hand digging.
(C) Irrigation heads shall be set so that the final level of ground around the heads conforms to the surrounding grades, or as otherwise specified. Risers are considered unsightly and hazardous and shall be prohibited in any situation where 12" pop-ups, underthrowing, or other coverage methods can be used. Where the use of risers is approved by the DRB, they shall be Schedule 40 PVC and all visible equipment shall be painted with flat brown or black enamel paint so as to blend with the surrounding material.
30
(D) All backflow devices shall be in vaults unless otherwise required by the ZOs; exposed free-standing backflow devices are prohibited. Rain sensors shall be mounted in an obscure but unobstructed location.
(E) The system shall be fully automatic. All pipe shall be Class 160 PVC or better. Spray and rotor heads shall not be combined on the same zones. All pop-up rotors shall be connected to the supply lines with swing joints or flex hose, as shall all spray heads located next to drives or roads.
(F) All pipe and control wires routed under roads and paved areas shall be sleeved and placed in a minimum of 24 inches below grade and backfilled with clean fill. No rock shall come in contact with the PVC pipe.
(G) The system should be timed to operate during non-business hours, and in accordance with any applicable requirements of State or local agencies.
5.6 CONTINUED MAINTENANCE
All landscaping as approved by the DRB shall be maintained in perpetuity by the owner, successors, and/or assigns of each property, pursuant to the requirements of Section 7.0.
6.0 SIGNAGE
6.1 ARCHITECTURAL SIGN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
(A) SIGNAGE DESIGN OBJECTIVES
(i) The overall intention of signage for the FJDGC is to create a coordinated effect with the approved architectural design for each site, to reinforce the overall design theme of the site and the entire FJDGC.
