if the ordinance had not been repealed or amended.



   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is

intention of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no
meaning can be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or
words was clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be
corrected, and the word or words supplied, omitted or substituted as will
conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same
effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as originally
published.  No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question exists
regarding the nature or extent of the error.

§ 10.15  PENDING SUITS.



   No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former
ordinance, whether the former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to
any offense committed against the former ordinance or as to any act done, any
penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred or any right accrued, or claim
arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatsoever to affect any
offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising before the new
ordinance takes effect, save only that proceedings thereafter shall conform
as far as practicable to the ordinance in force at the time of the
proceeding. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any
provision of a new law or ordinance, the provision may, by consent of the
party affected, be applied to any judgment pronounced after the new
ordinances take effect. This section shall extend to all repeals either by
express words or by implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance
making any new provisions upon the same subject or any other ordinance.
Nothing contained in this or § 10.14 shall be construed as abating any
action new pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the city,
herein repealed; or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any
penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person,
firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the city under any section or
provision of ordinances existing at the time of the passage of this code.

codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain in effect and are

(Ord. 8896, passed 1-2-2001)



§ 10.99  GENERAL PENALTY.



   (A)   General penalty.  Whoever violates any provision of this code
or other ordinance of this city for which another penalty is not specifically
provided, shall be fined not more than $750 for each and every violation
thereof, and every day the violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.



(1980 Code, § 33.101)



   (B)   Special penalties.



      (1)   Generally.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, special penalties are established for certain violations of the
provisions of this code as provided in this section. In the event maximum
penalties exceed those which may be imposed by the city as a home rule unit
of local government pursuant to the provisions of § 6, Article VII (Local
Government) of the Constitution of the state, or otherwise by law, the
maximum penalties shall be deemed to be reduced to the allowable maximum.



      (2)   Notice of violation.



         (a)   Minimum penalties.  The minimum penalty for any
violation of this code for which a notice of violation is used pursuant to
division (C) below, shall be that penalty prescribed for the violation if
paid to the City Treasurer as provided therein. The minimum penalty shall not
be deemed to include, however, the additional sum due under division (C)
below if the penalty is not timely paid.



         (b)   Animal running at large.  The city has determined
that animals running at large are a nuisance to the public health, safety and
welfare. Accordingly, in the event a person, firm or corporation violates §
90.010 or § 90.011 of this code, the minimum penalty for the offense shall
be increased from the amount set forth in division (C) below by the sum of
$25 for each and every offense beyond the first offense committed within the
24-month period preceding the date of an offense. Thus, for example, if
within the preceding 24-month period from the date of an offense the person,
firm or corporation has committed an offense one other time, the minimum
penalty would be $100; or if two other times the minimum penalty would be
$125. For purposes of this division, the dates of any offense are to be
considered, rather than any other date such as the date of a finding of
guilty. Additionally, only those offenses or violations are to be considered
for which the person, firm or corporation has paid the penalty in response to
a notice of violation or has been found guilty or entered a plea of guilty to
the offense (even if thereafter place on supervision). This section shall not
be construed to allow the presentation of evidence of earlier offenses at any
hearing relative to any offense until the alleged offender has been found
guilty or entered a plea of guilty to the offense involved. In addition to
other proof as the court shall deem competent, a certificate of the Circuit
Clerk, a certificate of the City Treasurer or a certificate of the Chief of
Police or a records keeper of the City Police Department shall be prima facie
evidence of prior violations.



         (c)   Cross connection control.  In the event a person,
firm or corporation is alleged to have violated the provisions of §
52.079(A), (B) or (C) or § 52.083(A) of this code, pertaining to cross
connection control surveys and inspections, the minimum penalty for the
offense shall be increased from the amount set forth in division (C) below as
provided in this division. The penalty shall be increased by the sum of $25
for each and every violation subsequent to the first violation occurring
within the 12- month period from the date of the first violation in the
manner described in division (B)(2)(b) above.



         (d)   Early collection of garbage and trash. In the
event a person, firm or corporation has violated the provisions of § 50.20
of this code, pertaining to the early time limit for the collection by a
commercial collector of garbage, trash, grease or debris, the minimum penalty
for the offense shall be increased from the amount set forth in division (C)
below by the sum of $200 for each and every violation subsequent to the first
violation occurring within the 12-month period from the date of first
violation in the manner described in division (B)(2)(b) above.



      (3)   Peace disturbance.  The minimum penalty for peace
disturbance as set forth in § 132.01 of this code shall be $100 if the
conduct on which the offense is based occurred in whole or in part in a
public place. For purposes hereof, a public place shall include but not be
limited to any place, premises or area to which the public as opposed to
certain private individuals have a right to resort or access; a place,
premises or area visited by many persons rather than simply a few; a place,
premises or area exposed to the public; or a place, premises or area where
the public gathers together or passes to and fro.



      (4)   Possession of cannabis.  The penalties for the

         (a)   Less than two and one-half grams.  Possessing
less than two and one-half grams of any substance containing cannabis shall
be fined not less than $100 and not more than $500;



         (b)   Two and one-half to ten grams.  Possession of two
and one-half grams or more, but not more than ten grams of any substance
containing cannabis shall be fined not less than $200 and not more than $750;
and



         (c)   More than ten grams.  Possessing more than ten
grams but not more than 30 grams of any substance containing cannabis shall
be fined not less than $300 and not more than $1,000.



      (5)   Demolition of designated property.  Any unauthorized
demolition of a landmark of any property within a designated Historic
District shall be punishable by a fine not less than $500 nor more than
$5,000. In the case of an unauthorized demolition, the city may refuse to
issue a building permit for the subject property for a period not to exceed

liquor in a night club, irrespective where the actual arrest took place, the
violator shall be fined not more than $1,000 and not less than $500 and, at

less than $100 and not more than $500.

equal to the court costs would be assessable by the Circuit Court upon the
disposition of the violation. The additional sum shall not be deemed to be or
constitute the collection of court costs, but is merely the manner in which
the additional sum is determined. Collection of this additional sum shall be
waived by the Chief of Police, or his or her designate, or other enforcing
officer designated under this code, upon receiving satisfactory proof or
evidence that the person, firm or corporation did not receive actual notice
of the issuance of the notice of violation during the initial period at which
time payment could have been made without payment of the additional sum.
Prior to the time designated for payment herein, the Water Superintendent, or
his or her designate, shall further have the authority to waive collection of
the prescribed penalty for alleged violations of §§ 52.079 and 52.083,
pertaining to cross connection controls, upon receipt of satisfactory proof
that the person, firm or corporation has complied or is in compliance with
the requirements of the section. In the event that payment is made in
accordance herewith, the payment shall be in full satisfaction of any penalty
for the violation. Nothing herein shall prevent or preclude enforcement as
provided or allowed by this code for separate, independent, prior or
subsequent violations. In the event that payment is not made within the time
periods prescribed, that is, within 28 days, a complaint, notice to appear or
other appropriate document shall be filed by the Chief of Police or officer
of the Police Department, or other appropriate person or other enforcing
officer designated under this code or by an information initiated by the City
Attorney, before a court of proper jurisdiction charging the violation.

(1980 Code, § 32.003)  (Ord. 9275, passed 2-17-2015; Ord. 9276, passed
2-17-2015; Ord. 9329, passed 3-19-2018)



   (D)   Separate violations.  Any person, firm or corporation
violating any provision of this code shall be guilty of a separate offense
for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any
provision of this code is committed, continued or permitted by any person,
firm or corporation.



(1980 Code, § 32.004)



   (E)   Supervision.



      (1)   Generally.  In addition or as an alternative to
imposing a penalty as provided for herein, a court of competent jurisdiction
may place a person, firm or corporation violating any provision of this code
on supervision. When a person, firm or corporation is placed on supervision,
the court shall enter an order for supervision specifying the period of
supervision and shall defer further proceedings in the case until the
conclusion of that period.



      (2)   Period of supervision.  The period of supervision shall
be reasonable under all of the circumstances of the case, but may not be
longer than one year.



      (3)   Conditions.  The court may, in addition to other
considerations, require that the person, firm or corporation placed on
supervision:



         (a)   Make a report to and appear it person before the
court or participate with the court’s social service agency as directed by
the court in the order of supervision;



         (b)   Pay a monetary penalty and/or court costs;



         (c)   Work or pursue a course of study or vocational
training;



         (d)   Undergo medical or psychiatric treatment or
treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism;



         (e)   Attend or reside in a facility established for the
instruction or residence of those on probation;



         (f)   Support his or her dependents;



         (g)   Refrain from possessing a firearm or other
dangerous weapons;



         (h)   If a minor:



            1.   Reside with his or her parents or legal
guardian or in a foster home;



            2.   Attend school or other training program;



            3.   Attend a non-residential program for youth;
and



            4.   Contribute to his or her own support at home
or in a foster home.



         (i)   Make restitution or reparation in an amount not to
exceed actual loss or damage to property and pecuniary loss, determining
additionally the amount and conditions of payment; and



         (j)   Perform some reasonable public service work such
as, but not limited to, the picking up of litter in public parks or along
public streets and alleys or the maintenance of public facilities.



      (4)   Deferral of judgment.  The court shall defer entering
any judgment on the charges until the conclusion of the supervision.



      (5)   Compliance with supervision.  At the conclusion of the
period of supervision, if the court determines that the person, firm or
corporation has successfully complied with all of the conditions of
supervision, the court shall discharge the person, firm or corporation and
enter a judgment dismissing the violation charged.



      (6)   Effect of supervision.  Discharge and dismissal upon a
successful conclusion of a disposition of supervision shall be deemed without
adjudication of guilt and shall not be termed a conviction for purposes of
disqualification or disability imposed by law on conviction of a violation
hereunder. Three  years after discharge and dismissal under this section, a
person, firm or corporation may, on request to the Chief of Police or his or
her designee, have his, her or its record of alleged violation expunged.



      (7)   Immunity.  Neither the city nor any official or
employee thereof acting in the course of his or her official duties shall be
liable for any tortious acts of any person placed on supervision who is given
any public service work as a condition of supervision, except for willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the city, the official or the
employee.



      (8)   Non-employee.  No person assigned to a public service
employment program shall be considered an employee for any purpose of the
city, the county or other party.



      (9)   Incarceration.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to allow
the violation of any provision of this code to be punishable by incarceration
or imprisonment.



(1980 Code, § 32.005)



   (F)   Restitution.  In addition to imposing a penalty as provided
for herein, a court of competent jurisdiction may additionally require that
the person, firm or corporation violating a provision hereof make restitution
to any person, firm or corporation who or which incurs property damage as a
result of the violation. Any court finding a person, firm or corporation in
violation of a provision hereof shall, at the request of the City Attorney
and after proof of property damage is made, require the making of restitution
to the city in any case in which property damage has been incurred by the
city.



(1980 Code, § 32.006)



   (G)   Alternative sections.  In all cases where the same offense is
made punishable or is created by different clauses or to sections of this
code, the prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed; but not more
than one recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense;
provided that the revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a
recovery or penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced.



(1980 Code, § 32.007)



   (H)   Other remedies.  Nothing herein shall be construed to affect
any just, equitable or legal right or remedy which may otherwise be available
to the city or any other person, firm or corporation as a result of the
violation of this code.



(1980 Code, § 32.008)



   (I)   Crime laboratory; analysis fee.  When a person has been
adjudged guilty of an offense in violation of § 136.02 or 136.03 or placed
on court supervision for same, in addition to any other disposition, penalty
or fine imposed, a criminal laboratory analysis fee of $100 for which he or
she was convicted, found guilty, and/or placed on court supervision shall be
levied by the court, unless waived by the city at the time of sentencing.
Upon verified petition of the person, the court may suspend payment of all or
part of the fee if it finds the person does not have the ability to pay the
fee. The fee shall be paid to the crime laboratory doing the analysis and
shall be placed in a dedicated fund by that agency to support laboratory or
anti-drug activity. The fee shall, in no event, be payable to the general
fund of any unit of government.



      (1)   Generally.  City attorneys shall be entitled, in their
official capacity and on behalf of the General Fund of the city, a municipal
corporation, to the following fees; however, the fee requirement of this
section does not apply to actions before city boards or commissions:



         (a)   For each finding of “guilty” in ordinance
violation cases presented before judges of the circuit court, whether by
trial, stipulation, admission or plea, $10;



         (b)   For each case of appeal, of any action or
ordinance of the city, taken from Adams County to the Supreme or Appellate
Court when prosecuted, argued, briefed, attended or defended by the City
Attorney, $50;



         (c)   In addition to any other fee provided herein, for
each day, or part thereof, actually employed in the trial of a case, $25; in
which case the court before whom the case is tried shall make an order
specifying the number of days for which a per diem shall be allowed;



         (d)   For each case of forfeited cash or recognizance
bond or ex parte judgement where the forfeiture or ex parte judgement is set
aside at the instance of the defense, in addition to the ordinary costs, $10
for each defendant;



         (e)   For each day actually employed in the hearing of a
case of habeas corpus in which the city is interested, $25;



         (f)   For each day or portion thereof actually employed
in the hearing of a case of any post trial motion, common law writ, motion
for judgment notwithstanding a verdict, or any other pleading attacking a
finding of guilty by or on behalf of the defendant before any court and in
which the city is interested, $25 per defendant in which case the court
before whom the case is tried shall make an order specifying the number of
days for which a per diem shall be allowed; and



         (g)   For any prosecution of any ordinance where the
City Attorney files a motion for summary judgment with the court and the city
is awarded judgment of guilty in any case that is the object of the motion
for summary judgment, $25.



      (2)   Exceptions.  The assessment of the fees as set forth
above shall not apply and no City Attorney fees shall be ordered in the
following instances:



         (a)   No appearance fee per division (J)(1)(a) shall
apply to a plea of guilty or stipulated trial entered into by agreement
between the city and the defendant for a violation of any provision of Title
VII of the code;



         (b)   No person under the age of 18 years on the date of
the alleged offense shall be assessed any trial or appearance fee under any
of the provisions of division (J)(1) of this section; provided, however; this
exception is not applicable to persons found guilty of violating any
provision of Chapter 111 of the code of the city and both appearance and
trial fees, as applicable, shall be assessed by the court in those cases;



         (c)   The City Attorney or any attorney appearing in his
or her stead is hereby authorized as the agent of the city to waive any or
all of the fees at any stage of any case;



         (d)   Where a defendant presents a bona fide
constitutional challenge to any enactment, ordinance, resolution or
undertaking of the city, irrespective whether the challenge is successful, no
fees under division (J)(1) of this division shall be ordered. Where the
defendant is unsuccessful in this challenge, the court shall make findings
whether the constitutional challenge was bona fide in nature and make an
order excepting the defendant from the fees provided for in division (J)(1)
of this division;



         (e)   No defendant whose sole income is any form of
disability payment from the United States Social Security Administration
shall be assessed any trial or appearance fee under any of the provisions of
division (J)(1) of this division: provided, however; this exception is not
applicable to persons found guilty of violating any provision of Chapter 111
of the code of the city and both appearance and trial fees, as applicable,
shall be assessed by the court in those cases;



         (f)   Where two or more charges are tried, presented or
resolved in the court appearance, the court shall assess trial and appearance
fees as set forth in division (J)(1) of this division for whichever case
results in the higher aggregate trial and appearance fee and deem the trial
and appearance fee waived in the case or cases which would result in a lesser
fee; the policy of the city being to require but one payment for one trial or
appearance.



      (3)   Method of collection.



         (a)   All the foregoing fees shall be taxed as costs to
be collected through the Circuit Clerk from the defendant upon finding of
guilty.



         (b)   The City Attorney shall have a lien for the fees
ordered under division (J)(1) of this division against any and all assets of
defendant, by whomsoever held, until the fees and earnings are fully paid.



         (c)   Where the court has ordered restitution in the

§ 40.083  FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENT; APPOINTMENT; PROMOTION OF MEMBERS.



   (A)   Generally.



      (1)   The Board of Fire and Police Commissioners shall appoint
all officers and members of the Fire and Police Departments of the
municipality including the Chief of Police and the Chief of the Fire
Department, unless the City Council shall by ordinance as to them otherwise
provide.



      (2)   The appointment of the Fire Chief and Police Chief shall
be subject to the limitations and restrictions otherwise provided in this
case including specifically but not limited to, those limitations and
provisions contained in Chapters 37 and 38 hereof.



   (B)   Probation. All initial appointments to the lowest rank of
firefighter shall be subject to a period of probation not exceeding one year,
except as otherwise may be provided by collective bargaining agreement.
Unless otherwise provided by collective bargaining agreement, all other
appointments, including original and promotional (including the Fire and
Police Chief) shall be subject to a period of probation for such term as the
Board of Fire and Police Commissioners shall, by rule, determine not
exceeding, for police officers, 18 months from the date of the appointment or
promotion and for  firefighters, 12 months from the date of the appointment
or promotion or as otherwise allowed by ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 10-2.1-6.3.
Unless otherwise provided by collective bargaining agreement, the Board shall
have authority during any such probationary period to discharge or demote the
probationary appointee without assigning cause or without a hearing, Unless
otherwise provided by collective bargaining agreement, the Board of Fire and
Police Commissioners may, for good cause, extend the period of probation of
an appointment for police officers by an additional period not exceeding six
months from the expiration of the original period of probation. Good cause
may include, but is not limited to, the failure of the probationary employee
to serve a sufficient period of active duty during the period of probation,
to permit the board to evaluate the appointee's competence and qualification
to perform the duties required of the appointed position. For firefighters,
the period of probation may be extended only in the event that a firefighter
is required to be a licensed paramedic, during which extended period the sole
reason that the firefighter may be discharged without a hearing is for
failing to meet the requirements for paramedic licensure. Nothing herein
shall be construed nor shall it affect any salary or other benefits to which
a firefighter or policeman would otherwise be entitled under any collective
bargaining between the employee’s collective bargaining representative and
the city.

the same shall constitute cause for removal from the Department. Nothing

which a firefighter or policeman, would otherwise be entitled under any
collective bargaining between the employee’s collective bargaining
representative and the city.

held immediately prior to this appointment as Chief, if his or her term
terminates, or he or she resigns as Chief or is discharged as Chief prior to
attaining eligibility to retire on pension, he or she shall revert to and be

and emoluments of the prior rank without regard as to whether a vacancy then
exits in the rank.

respective chiefs leadership, planning, organizational and administrative
abilities, judgment and problem solving abilities, oral and written
communication skills, attitude, skill in development of subordinate
employees, relationship with subordinate employees, administration and the
public, as well as such other matters which the Mayor and Director of

appointments to the Fire Department other than that of the lowest rank shall
be made in accordance with the Illinois Fire Department Promotion Act, ILCS
Ch. 50, Act. 742, §§ 1  et seq., and any applicable collective bargaining
agreement. The Chief of Police, Deputy Police Chiefs, the Chief of the Fire

§ 40.085  EXAMINATION OF APPLICANTS.



   (A)   The Board of Fire and Police Commissioners shall conduct such
examinations for appointment to the Fire and Police Departments as required
from time to time to maintain a register of eligibles as hereinafter
provided. Subject to applicable provisions of state law governing appointment
of members to the Fire Department and options provided by law concerning the
procedure for making such appointments, the Board shall have authority, as it
determines, to utilize the services of the Illinois Department of Employment
Security for purposes of advertising and processing applications for such
examinations. Except for applicants who have successfully attended and
graduated from an accredited Illinois Police corps program administered
through the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board, and except
for applicants for firefighter positions who are appointed by means of the
procedures provided by ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 10-2.1-6.4, all testing and
evaluation of eligible applicants shall be performed by the Board of Fire and
Police Commissioners. Graduates of an IPC program shall be subject to such
oral interviews or evaluations, including psychological and background
evaluation, as the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners determines. Except

applicants for a position in either the Fire or Police Department of the
municipality shall be not less than 20 and 1/2 years of age nor more than 35
years of age, shall be subject to an examination which shall be public,
competitive, and free to all applicants, except subject to reasonable and
legal limitations as to residence (consistent with any applicable collective
bargaining agreement), habits and moral character, which limitations may be
adopted by rules of the Board, except that no person shall commence service
until he or she is at least 21 years of age. The foregoing age limitation
does not apply to any person previously employed as a full-time policeman or
fireman in a regularly constituted Police or Fire Department of any
municipality for a period of at least one year, nor does it apply to any
applicant for a firefighter position to whom the age limitation does not
apply under ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 10-2.1-6.3 or to applicants for police and
firefighter positions who quality for the exceptions listed at ILCS Ch. 65,
Act 5, § 10-2.1-6(d) through (f). Subject to the terms of any applicable
collective bargaining agreement, any full time member of a regular Fire
Department of a Fire Protection District which was discontinued and whose
obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 21 of “An Act in
Relation to Fire Protection Districts" who has served at least one year as a
full time member of such Department shall become a member of the classified
service of the Fire Department in the municipality in the position held by
him at the time of such discontinuance, without examination and age
limitation. Subject to the provisions of ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 10-2.1-6.3
and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement, the Council
may by ordinance provide that persons residing outside the municipality are

equivalent or greater degree from an accredited college or university may be
preferred by the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners in the establishment

register of eligibles. In the case of applicants for firefighter positions,
persons who have the qualifications or credentials, including educational
credentials, listed in ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 10-2.1-6.2(h) may be preferred
in the appointment from the initial eligibility register. For police
positions, nothing herein shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board's
discretion to appoint from among the three highest ranking applicants as
otherwise provided or allowed by applicable statutory provisions, this
subchapter, or the rules of the Board. For firefighter positions, the Board
shall appoint to the position the person with the highest ranking on the
final eligibility list, with an allowance for such exceptions as are provided
under ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 10-2.1-6.3.

classified by his local selective service draft board as a conscientious
objector, or who has ever been so classified, may be appointed to the Police
Department.



   (D)   No person shall be appointed to the Police or Fire Department
unless he is a person of good character. "Good character" as used herein
shall mean a person whose character is free of traits or habits which would
prevent, impede or inhibit the satisfactory performance of the duties,
responsibilities, and tasks of the position, including, by way of example,
but not limited to, a gambler or a person who has been convicted of a felony
or a crime involving moral turpitude. Subject to the terms of an applicable
collective bargaining agreement, any such person who is in either Department
may be removed on charges brought and after a hearing as hereinafter
provided. However, anyone arrested for any cause but not convicted thereon
shall not be disqualified from taking the examination to qualify for a
position on the Police Department or Fire Department on grounds or habits of
moral character.

for two years. If a person is overage when his or her name is stricken, the
person may not thereafter be appointed or added to such list.

the Fire and Police Departments on the basis of ascertained merit and
seniority in service and examination, and shall provide in all cases, where
it is practicable, that vacancies shall be filled by promotion. All
examinations for promotion shall be competitive among such members of the
next lower rank as desire to submit themselves to examination, except, in the
case of the Police Department, when there are less than three applicants for
appointment and further except that the Chief of Police, the Deputy Police

appointed from among members of the Police and Fire Departments,
respectively, regardless of rank, unless the Council shall by ordinance as to
them otherwise provide. Notwithstanding any other rule or regulation of the
Board or otherwise, a member who has not completed a promotional probationary
appointment shall likewise be eligible for appointment to the position of
Police or Fire Chief respectively.



      (2)   The Board in determining next in order of rank in

policy of extending the examination to all ranks of the Police Department in
an endeavor to quality suitable eligibles before extending the examinations
to any person having the necessary qualifications. With respect to the Police
Department, all promotions shall be made from the three having the highest
rating, and where there are less than three names on the promotional eligible
register, appointment may be made from those names remaining. The method of
examination and the rules governing promotion in the Police Department shall
be the same as provided for applicants for original appointment. With respect
to the File Department, promotions shall be made in accordance with the
provisions of the Fire Department Promotion Act and/or any applicable
collective bargaining agreement. The Board shall strike off the names of
candidates for promotional appointment after they have remained thereon for
more than two years provided that there is no vacancy existing which can be

existing upon other properties in the immediate vicinity and in the same
zoning district; and

notice requirements of these provisions shall be deemed satisfied. Proof of
service by affidavit shall be filed with the Secretary of the Board of

ordinance setting forth any variation it has approved.

scheduled hearing has been published or served on adjoining property owners,
the hearing may be continued or withdrawn only upon approval of the Board of
Appeals. A request by an applicant for continuation or withdrawal may be
granted for good cause shown. The requests must be made in person or in
writing to the Board of Appeals, setting forth the reasons for the request.
Notwithstanding any request, the Board of Appeals may hold any required
public hearing and make a recommendation to the City Council regarding the
application; or grant a continuance and defer taking any final action, but
proceed with any required public hearing. If an applicant (who has otherwise
failed to previously request a continuation or withdrawal of an application)
fails to appear at the scheduled hearing, the application may be denied by
the Board of Appeals with or without any required public hearing.



   (F)   Review.  Any applicant may seek review of a decision of the
Board of Appeals by filing a written request with the City Clerk within 30
days of the Board of Appeals hearing. The applicant shall file also a copy of

Appeals.

decision, the City Council may pass the ordinance, approve or deny a request

health, safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. A decision
of the Electrical Commission to vary the application of any provisions shall

§ 40.309  APPEAL PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Right of appeal.  Any owner or person who is aggrieved or

Commission may appeal the order, ruling decision or interpretation as herein
provided.



   (B)   Initiation of appeal.  An owner or person desiring to appeal
to the Building Commission shall file with the Building Inspector, as
Secretary of the Building Commission, a notice of appeal. The notice or
appeal must be filed and received by the Building Inspector within 14 days
from the date of the enforcing officer’s order, ruling, decision or
interpretation from which appealed. The notice of appeal must specify the
specific grounds or reasons for the appeal and include or have attached a
copy of the order, ruling, decision or interpretation, or a part thereof,
appealed from. A copy of the notice of appeal, together with all attachments,
shall also be provided to the enforcing officer but a failure to serve the
notice upon the enforcing officer shall not be jurisdictional. Timely filing
of the notice of appeal with the Building Inspector shall be jurisdictional.



   (C)   Hearing and decisions.  The Building Commission shall, in
every case, hold a hearing. The Commission shall, at the hearing, consider
all pertinent information presented by the enforcing officer and the owner or
person appealing. A decision shall be reached without unreasonable or
unnecessary delay. Every decision of the Building Commission shall be in
writing and shall be promptly filed in the office at the Building Inspector
and the enforcing officer. A copy of the decision shall be sent by mail or
otherwise delivered to the owner or person appealing. If a decision of the
Commission reverses the order, ruling, decision or interpretation of the
enforcing officer, the enforcing officer shall take action immediately in
accordance with the decision.



   (D)   Action taken in decision.  In rendering its decision, the
Building Commission may take whatever action it deems appropriate under the
circumstances. The actions may include, but shall not necessarily be limited
to, affirming or reversing the decision of the enforcing officer, modifying
the order, ruling, decision or interpretation of the enforcing officer,
rendering its own order, ruling, decision or interpretation or granting, if
so requested, a variance from the applicable requirement appeal from.



   (E)   Variance.  A variance may not be granted by the Building
Commission except after a public hearing. Public notice of the hearing to
grant a variance shall be published not less than 15 days nor more than 30
days before a hearing in a newspaper published within the city. The costs of
publication shall be paid in advance by the owner or person seeking the
variance. The applicable provisions sought to be varied shall not be varied
unless, in the opinion of the Building Commission, the enforcement thereof
would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, provided that
the spirit of the applicable provision shall nevertheless be observed, public
health, safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. A decision
of the Building Commission to vary the application of any provisions shall
specify in what manner the variation shall be made, the condition upon which
it is made and the reasons therefore.



   (F)   Determination of City Council.  Any person appealing to the
Building Commission may, within 14 days after the decision is tendered, file
a request in writing with the Building Inspector that he or she transmit a
copy of the decision to the City Council, which the Building Inspector shall
do forthwith. The determination of the Commission shall automatically be
final unless the determination is appealed to the City Council and is
reversed by a two-thirds vote of the members of the City Council within 14
days after the decision is first presented to the City Council.

(1980 Code, § 13.219)  (Ord. 9138, passed 2-9-2009)



§ 42.049  POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.



   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a
person because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual
harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in
an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable
misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations.
It is a policy of the City of Quincy to prohibit harassment of any person by
any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal
agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials,
municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are
prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment
relationship or lack thereof.



   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment. This policy adopts the
definition of sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act,
which currently defines sexual harassment as:



      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual
favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:



         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;



         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an
individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual; or



         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of
substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating
an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.



      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:



         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments,
insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits,
sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements
about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.



         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds
(whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
"catcalls", "smacking" or "kissing" noises.



         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a
sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites.



         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.



         (e)   Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically
sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use
of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all
forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages,
intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network
websites like Facebook and Twitter).



      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are
easier to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment
is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of
what would offend a "reasonable person."



   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.



      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or
believes herself/ himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal
with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly
communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his
immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be
directed at the person making the report.



      (2)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be
sexual harassment, including the following:



         (a)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is
sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should
directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome
and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be
verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a
note or a memo.



         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same
time direct communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels
threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly
reported to the immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a
department head, the director of human resources, or the director of
administrative services, for the City of Quincy.



      (3)   (a)   The employee experiencing what he or she
believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware
of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a
supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be
presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.



         (b)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of
this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for
responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified
and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the
right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a
formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within
180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A
complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days.



      (4)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any
report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including,
but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and
telephone messages.



      (5)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be
accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention
of the municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual
harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation
and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation
is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.



   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.



      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal
employee or municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action
against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:



         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any
violation of this policy;



         (b)   The provision of information related to or
testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or
inquiry into any violation of this policy; or



         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to
enforce the provisions of this policy.



      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action
means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or
transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal
employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement
in protected activity pursuant to this policy.



      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against
even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any
witness will be protected from retaliation. Similar to the prohibition
against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 15-10) provides whistleblower protection
from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion,
or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee
who does any of the following:



         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor
or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member,
state agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably
believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;



         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any
violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency
or other state employee; or



         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce
the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.



      (4)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act
174, § 15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who
discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a
legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an
employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to
a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable
cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or
federal law, rule, or regulation. (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 15(b)).



      (5)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch.
775, Act 5, § 6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for
two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she
has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be
sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation,
proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.



      (6)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower
paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR
or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge - due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300
days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation.



   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual
harassment. In addition to any and all other discipline that may be
applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures,
employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who
violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in
ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state
law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a  separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from
any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties
imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency.



   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.



      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by
an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other
than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual
harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be
proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or
frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary
action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or
discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements,
procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements.



      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false
report alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State
Police, a State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law
enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission
may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who
intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.



   (G)   City of Quincy Employee Handbook. A copy of this sexual
harassment policy shall replace the existing policy set forth in the City of
Quincy Employee Handbook, which sets forth the city's personnel policies and
procedures.

organizations are hereby prohibited from engaging in strikes, work stoppages,

      (1)   That he or she will not discriminate against any
employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex,
sexual orientation, marital status, national origin or ancestry, citizenship
status, age, physical or mental disability unrelated to ability, sexual
orientation, military status or an unfavorable discharge from military

employer” in all job announcements.



   (B)   The AA/EEO policy will be published in the city employee
handbook and posted on relevant bulletin boards for information purposes. It

to all city employees.



   (D)   The Mayor or his designee will discuss with all department
heads his commitment to equal opportunity and, where appropriate, affirmative
action, the intent of the policy and the extent of their responsibility for
effective implementation.



   (E)   Department heads will discuss with their supervisors the
Mayor’s commitment and as well their own support of equal opportunity and
affirmative action, the intent of the policy and the extent of their

Department and City Clerk’s office.



(Ord. 9197, passed 10-25-2011)



§ 42.116 CITY HIRING PRACTICES.



   Efforts will be made to hire minority individuals for all job
categories so that minority employment in all categories of the work force
will represent a proportionate share of minority populations in the city as
well as surrounding areas.



   (A)   The Affirmative Action Officer is responsible for maintaining
and monitoring accurate and up-to-date records of all applicants, referrals,
hires, promotions, transfers and terminations by race, sex and disability to
be certain that all employees are treated on a fair and equitable basis; to
review job postings, and selection, available in an accessible format; to
inform the Mayor of the effectiveness of the plan and recommend necessary
improvements. The Affirmative Action Officer will periodically audit the
applicant pool to determine if the target group is represented in relation to
the available labor market; conduct internal audits as required to measure
the effectiveness of city programs and indicate the need for corrective
action. The Affirmative Action Officer shall act as a liaison between the
city, Commission on Equal Opportunities, other community organizations
concerned with affirmative action issues, and with governmental compliance
agencies. The Affirmative Action Officer will coordinate the city’s
discrimination procedure and provide assistance to supervisors in resolving
complaints/inquiries; serve as recipient for all formal and informal
discrimination complaints; provide for a prompt, complete and independent
investigation of discrimination complaints; inform the Mayor of findings and
resolution of the complaint; and maintain a written report on file for
reference or review by appropriate authorities. Any individual who feels that
he or she has been unlawfully discriminated against may file a complaint by
following the complaint procedure in § 42.119.



   (B)   The Human Resources Department shall keep records of each step
in the employment process to be reviewed by the Affirmative Action Officer as
necessary and shall provide a workforce analysis of all employees by race,
disability and sex and analysis of each major department unit by job title,
by race and sex, with any recommendations for improvement. The Affirmative
Action Officer may review the entire employment process and make
recommendations to the Mayor including recommendations that will increase the
number of target group applicants in job categories in which underutilization
exists. The Director of Human Resources shall review the applications for
positions to determine whether they are representative of the target group
available in the labor market. If a review of the applications does not
reflect such availability the posting period should be extended unless the
Affirmative Action Officer determines that a good faith effort has been made.
Only job related criteria shall be used in screening applicants. The Director
of Human Resources shall present the recommended candidate(s) to the Mayor
for review and will verify appropriate steps were taken to comply with the
city’s Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity Plan. Based on an
evaluation of the interview, credentials, qualifications and experience, the
best-suited candidate shall be hired. All offers of employment are contingent
on the completion of a successful health/physical examination, criminal
background check, drug screening and approval of the Mayor.



   (C)   The city’s training programs shall be administered without
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin,
ancestry, age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, unfavorable military
discharge, disability or other protected status; provided, however, that the
city may cooperate with interest groups which may from time to time offer
testing preparation or other skills development specifically to minority or
disadvantaged potential applicants which training may not be fully available

§ 42.117  ACCOMMODATIONS.



   The city will provide accommodations to the best of its ability for
employees with disabilities, contingent on budget and structural limitations.
Reasonable accommodations are modifications or adjustments that allow a
person with disability to enjoy the same benefits of employment/services as
people without disabilities. In general, the applicant or employee with a
disability is responsible for letting the employer know that an accommodation
is needed to participate in the application process, to perform essential job
functions, or to receive equal benefits and privileges of employment. Any
person who believes he or she has been discriminated against on the basis of
his or her disability may file a complaint with the Affirmative Action
Officer in accordance with the complaint procedures outlined in § 42.119.



(Ord. 9197, passed 10-25-2011)



§ 42.118  COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.



   All city employees are expected to adhere to this subchapter and to
work actively for its implementation both internally and in carrying out the
city’s program activities. Each supervisor is required to become familiar
with the contents of the Affirmative Action/Equal Employment Opportunity Plan
and to take an active role in implementing its policies and practices. This
policy is to be implemented by all elected and appointed officials,
supervisors and directors who have responsibility for personnel functions.
Every supervisor of the city shall comply with this effort and monitor the
activities under their control and of personnel reporting to them.



(Ord. 9197, passed 10-25-2011)



§ 42.119  ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.



   (A)   Affirmative Action Officer.  The Affirmative Action Officer
may meet with any employee, applicant for employment, or city resident who
believes they may have been discriminated against by a representative of the
city. The purpose of such a meeting is to explain this policy and procedure
and provide information the person is legally entitled to receive. An
individual wishing to file a complaint shall sign a written complaint and
file it with the Affirmative Action Officer within 90 days after the alleged
act(s) occurred or within 90 days of the last occurrence of an ongoing
condition. A complaint will be considered officially filed on the date
physically received by the Affirmative Action Officer. The Affirmative Action
Officer will send to the complainant a written acknowledgement of the receipt
of the complaint within ten working days. The Affirmative Action Officer
shall establish a complaint file. The file shall contain all documents
pertinent to the complaint and its investigation. The file should include but
is not limited to the complaint; documents compiled as part of the
investigation; and statement of resolution. Files should be maintained
confidentially for at least five years. The Affirmative Action Officer shall
notify the complainant in writing of their rights and options under
applicable local, state and federal nondiscrimination laws. The information
will include access to enforcement agencies such as the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR).
This information is intended to assist the complainant and is not
all-inclusive. The notification will advise the complainant to seek
assistance in determining any of his/her rights by contacting the enforcement
agencies, his/her attorney or the collective bargaining unit.



   (B)   Confidentiality and retaliation.



      (1)   It is the policy of the city to keep the identity of the
complainant confidential unless there are compelling reasons to disclose such
identity. If there are compelling reasons to disclose the identity of the
complainant, then the complainant shall be asked if he/she wants his/her
identity disclosed. If the complainant does not want his/her identity
disclosed, then the identity of the complainant shall be kept confidential.
Should the complainant wish to keep his/her identity confidential, and should
it become impossible to process or investigate the complaint as a result of
the complainant not disclosing his/her identity, then the complaint may be
dismissed.



      (2)   Those persons who file complaints, who are witnesses or
testify, or who investigate or decide on the cases, will be protected from
retaliation for their actions. No city employee shall attempt to restrain,
interfere with, coerce, discriminate or take reprisal action against the
complainant(s) and their witness(es) during or after the presentation,
processing and resolution of a complaint.



   (C)   Informal complaint resolution.



      (1)   The city shall provide an opportunity for a resolution
of the complaint on an informal basis after the complaint has been filed.



      (2)   For the informal resolution of a complaint the
Affirmative Action Officer shall act as a facilitator if the complainant
wishes to resolve the matter short of a full investigation. The city shall
request the person who is alleged to be discriminating to seek a solution of
the matter on an informal basis, and to respond to the complainant within 20
working days.



      (3)   If the alleged discriminating employee chooses not to
respond to the request for an informal complaint resolution, then a formal
investigation will be conducted unless otherwise agreed to by the complainant
and the Affirmative Action Officer.



      (4)   If the complainant is satisfied with the response to the
request for an informal complaint resolution and an informal resolution of
the complaint is arrived at, the terms of such resolution shall be reduced to
writing and made a part of the complaint file. If the complainant is not
satisfied with the response, then the Affirmative Action Officer shall
proceed with the investigation.



   (D)   Investigation.



      (1)   The city shall complete an independent and impartial
investigation of the complaint within 60 days of the date it was filed. In
most cases the investigation will be conducted by the Affirmative Action
Officer. In some cases the investigation may be conducted by an investigative
team or outside consultant. The investigative team may consist of the
Director of Human Resources, the Affirmative Action Officer and the legal
counsel. In all cases the investigation shall be conducted in conjunction
with the legal counsel and/or the Director of Human Resource consultation.



      (2)   The investigation shall include a thorough review of the
circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred and any
policies and practices related to the situation. The investigation may
include the review of various documents and information acquired during the
investigation, which may include, but is not limited to, the response of the
alleged discriminating employee, written or oral statements from witnesses,
copies of or extracts from records, policy statements, or on site visits.



   (E)   Determination and appeal.



      (1)   After the investigation has been completed, the
investigator shall inform the Mayor or designee of his/her determination of
the complaint. The Mayor or designee shall inform the Affirmative Action
Officer of the city’s position on such determination of the complaint. The
Mayor or designee shall communicate in writing such determination of the
complaint to the complainant within 20 days from the time the complaint is
filed unless an extension is agreed to by both parties.



      (2)   After the complainant receives the written determination
of the city’s position, the complainant may request a reconsideration of
the city’s position. The reconsideration request must be filed within 20
working days after receipt of the determination. The written request for
reconsideration must contain a statement as to why the complainant is not
satisfied with the decision. The Mayor or designee will send the complainant
a written acknowledgment within 20 days after receipt of the reconsideration
request.



      (3)   The Mayor will select a panel of five consisting of no
less than two Aldermen, and the Mayor to review the decision and respond to
the complainant within 30 days on their determination.



      (4)   Nothing in this subchapter shall bar any person
complaining of discrimination from asserting all rights and remedies
available under the Illinois Human Rights Act and all federal laws relating
to disability, human rights, civil rights and discrimination in the workplace.

section shall be construed to prohibit the Purchasing Director from placing
additional announcements in recognized trade journals or other appropriate
advertising media. Advertisements for bids shall describe the character of
the proposed contract or agreement in sufficient detail to enable the bidders
thereon to know what their obligations will be, either in the advertisement
itself, or by reference to detailed plans and specifications on file at the
time of the publication of the first announcement. Advertisements shall be
received at any time subsequent to the time indicated in the announcement.
However, any extension of time may be granted for the opening of bids upon
publication in a daily newspaper of general circulation throughout the city
of the date of which the bid opening has been extended. The time of the bid
extension opening shall not be less than five days after the publication
thereof. Cashier’s check, a certified check or a bid bond, as a deposit of
good faith, in a reasonable amount but not in excess of 10% of the contract
amount may be required of each bidder by the Purchasing Director in all bids
involving amounts in excess of $10,000 and, if so required, the advertisement
for bids shall so specify.



(1980 Code, § 13.1610)



§ 44.048  OPENING OF BIDS.



   All sealed bids shall be publicly opened by a committee consisting of
the Purchasing Director of the city, the City Clerk and the head of the
department of the appropriate department concerned with the bid, or duly
designated representative or designee of the officials. The attendance of a
minimum of two of the bid opening committee shall be required at the bid
opening. All bids shall be open to public inspection. The Purchasing Director
shall submit his or her recommendation and evaluation regarding the bids to
the City Council, or, in the discretion or judgment of the Purchasing
Director (or as otherwise required by the City Council) to the appropriate or
designated committee of the City Council having responsibility for review and
evaluation of the contracts being bid.



(1980 Code, § 13.1611)

INSPECTION.



   The award of any contract involving amounts in excess of $10,000 shall
be made by the City Council to the lowest responsible bidder. Each bid, with
the name of the bidder, shall be entered on a record which record, with the
name of the successful bidder indicated thereon, shall after award of the
contract, be open to public inspection in the office of the Purchasing
Director. An official copy of each awarded contract together with all
necessary attachments, including assignments shall be retained by the
Purchasing Director in an appropriate file open to public inspection.



(1980 Code, § 13.1612)



§ 44.050  LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER.



   In determining the lowest responsible bidder, in addition to the price
of the bid, the following factors may be considered:



   (A)   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract or provide the service required;



   (B)   Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the
work promptly, or within the time specified, without the delay or
interference;



   (C)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder;



   (D)   The quality of the performance of previous contracts or work
of the bidder;



   (E)   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws
and ordinances relating to the contract to work;



   (F)   The financial responsibility and resources of the bidder;



   (G)   The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or
laborers of the bidder for the particular requirements of the contractor work;



   (H)   The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service for the use of the subject of the contract;



   (I)   The resale value of any equipment of personal property
provided under the contract;



   (J)   The number and scope of any conditions attached to the bid; and



   (K)   Other factors or circumstances as may fairly and reasonable
reflect on a bidder’s ability or responsibility to perform the contract.



(1980 Code, § 13.1613)



§ 44.051  REJECTION OF BIDS.



   Any and all bids received in response to and advertisement may be
rejected by the City Council.



(1980 Code, § 13.1614)



§ 44.052  SMALL PURCHASES.



   (A)   Generally.  Any procurement not exceeding $10,000 may be made
in accordance with the small purchases procedure authorized in this section.
Procurement requirements shall not be artificially divided or separated so as
to merely qualify as a small purchase.



   (B)   Small purchases over $3,000.  Except as otherwise provided
herein, or by city ordinance, contracts or procurements of small purchases in
excess of $3,000 may only be awarded or made upon approval by the City
Council after “solicitation of quotations” or requests for “sealed
proposals” as provided hereafter.



      (1)   Solicitation of quotations.  The Purchasing Director
shall solicit quotations in the manner provided in § 44.053 below, and shall
make a recommendation to the City Council and/or appropriate committee of the
Council as to the lowest acceptable quotation.



      (2)   Requests for sealed proposals.  In lieu of solicitation
of quotations, the Purchasing Director may request sealed proposals in the
manner provided in § 44.054 below, when the Director determines that sealed
proposals would be more advantageous to the city and provide for preferable
competition. The Director shall make a recommendation to the City Council
and/or appropriate committee of the Council as to the lowest acceptable and
responsible proposal.



   (C)   Small purchases under $3,000 but over $1,000.  Small
purchases under $3,000 but over $1,000 may be made by the Purchasing Director
by solicitation of quotations as provided in § 44.053 below. The procurement
shall be made from the business offering the lowest acceptable quotation.



   (D)   Small purchases under $1,000.  The Director of Purchasing may
implement operational procedures for making of small purchases of less than $
1,000 including purchases by department heads. The operational procedures
shall, however, provided for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition
for the supply, service or construction being purchased and shall include the
preparation and maintenance of records adequate to document the competition
obtained and accounting of funds expended.



(1980 Code, § 13.1615)



§ 44.053  SOLICITATION OF QUOTATIONS.



   To the extent practical for small purchases as provided in § 44.052,
the Purchasing Director shall solicit at least three competitive quotations.
Quotations may be solicited by mail, telephone or posting of a notice at City
Hall. The Purchasing Director shall maintain a record of the quotations,
including the name and address of the business and the date and amount of the
quote.



(1980 Code, § 13.1616)



§ 44.054  REQUEST FOR SEALED PROPOSALS.



   (A)   Condition for use.  When the Purchasing Director determines
that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not
advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the
request for sealed proposals method. By way of illustration only, the lack of
sufficient time or information to prepare specification suitable for
competitive bidding may warrant the more general request for proposals from
prospective contractors. As a further example, solicitations permitting a
range of alternative proposals and the possibility for evaluation and
discussion of proposals before making an award may, under some circumstances
(for example, computer software programs), be better suited to meeting
procurement needs than sealed competitive bidding.



   (B)   Requests for proposals.  Proposals shall be solicited through
a request for proposals.



   (C)   Public notice.  Adequate public notice of the request for
proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided in § 44.047 above
but the Purchasing Director shall have the discretion and authority to
solicit proposals by direct mail.



   (D)   Receipt of proposals.  No proposals shall be handled so as to
permit disclosure of the identity of any offeror or the contents of any
proposal to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register
of proposals shall be prepared containing the name of each offeror, the
number of modifications received if any, and a description sufficient to
identify the proposal. The register of proposals shall be for public
inspection only after contract award.



   (E)   Evaluation factors.  The request for proposals shall state
the relative importance of price and other relevant evaluation factors.



   (F)   Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to
proposals.  As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be
conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be
reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of
clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the
solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal
treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of
proposals and the revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to
award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting
discussions, there shall be no disclosure of the identity of competing
offerors or of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing
offerrors.



   (G)   Award.  The Purchasing Director and/or appropriate committee
of the City Council shall make a recommendation as to the responsible offeror
whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the city, taking
into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request
for proposals.



(1980 Code, § 13.1617)



§ 44.055  SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT.



   A contract in excess of $3,000 may be awarded by the City Council for a
supply, service or construction item without competition when, under
regulations promulgated by the Purchasing Director, the Purchasing Director
determines after a good faith review of available sources that there is only
one source for the required supply, service or construction item.



(1980 Code, § 13.1618)



§ 44.056  EMERGENCY CONTRACTS.



   Whenever an emergency threatening the public health and safety exists,
contracts in excess of $3,000 may be let to the extent necessary to resolve
the emergency without sealed competitive bidding, but a written report of the
action shall be presented to the City Council at its next regular meeting.



(1980 Code, § 13.1619)



§ 44.057  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.



   Contracts for the services of individuals possessing a high degree of
professional skill where the ability or fitness of the individual plays an
important role shall not be subject to sealed competitive bidding.



(1980 Code, § 13.1620)



§ 44.058  ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS.



   No contract shall be assignable or sublet by the successful bidder
without the consent of the City Council.



(1980 Code, § 13.1621)



§ 44.059  MODIFICATION OF CONTRACTS.



   Any contract modification of a contract involving the expenditure of
more than $3,000 shall be approved by the City Council.



(1980 Code, § 13.1622)

Director shall have the authority to purchase articles, materials and
supplies which are produced or manufactured by persons confined by the State
Department of Corrections in accordance with the State Unified Code of
Corrections for purchases not exceeding $3,000, provided the Purchasing
Director shall determine in writing that the purchases or procurement from
the State Department of Corrections is in the best interests and advantage of
the city.



(1980 Code, § 13.1624)



§ 44.086  PECUNIARY INTEREST IN CONTRACTS.



   Except as authorized by law, no city officer shall be interested
directly or indirectly, in his or her own name or, in the name of any other

consideration of the contract, work business, or sale is paid either from the

indirectly, in the purchase of any property which:



   (A)   Belongs to the city;

taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the
amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date
of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest of penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the
taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the
taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on
the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the
part of the taxpayer in which case the application shall be deemed invalid
and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator. However, any additional amounts
owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under
this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer.

standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section,
provided that:



            1.   The building, structure, facility or
installation is constructed at a site at which no other source is located;



            2.   The building, structure, facility or
installation totally replaces the process or production equipment that causes
the discharge of pollutants at an existing source; or



            3.   The production or wastewater generating
processes of the building, structure, facility or installation are
substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In

whatsoever arising out of the construction of the extension shall be
delivered to the Utilities Committee before construction of the extension is
commenced. Easements acceptable to the Utilities Committee for constructing
and maintaining requested as well as future extensions of the municipal sewer
system, as shown on the master plan for the city sewer extensions, shall be
provided and recorded at no expense to the city before any extension of the
system shall be made. Easements and all rights incident thereto shall become
the property of the city. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city
to extend the utmost cooperation permitted by law in the obtaining of the
easements, and upon completion of any extension of the municipal sewer system
and acceptance thereof by the Utilities Committee, a sum equal to the amount
collected by the city for connection fees to the extension, as provided in §
51.112 hereof, shall be paid to the person making the extension, or his or
her assigns, until the sum so paid equals the cost of extending that portion
of the sewer exactly as it is shown on the master plan for the city sewer
extensions, as the cost is determined to be by the Utilities Committee.
Refunds shall be made to persons extending the municipal sewer system in the
inverse order in period of time in which the extensions where made. No
reimbursement shall be made by the city for costs of interests, bonds,
easements, permits, licenses, insurance or administrative overhead of the
person extending the municipal sewer system. The Utilities Committee shall
have the authority to waive much of the requirements of this section as it

   The Director of Utilities and Engineering may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Director of
Utilities and Engineering and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
the action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be
a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(1980 Code, § 24.1403)  Penalty, see § 51.999



§ 51.253  COMPLIANCE ORDERS.



   When the Director of Utilities and Engineering finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Utilities and
Engineering may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service
may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders
also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not
extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for
any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations
are likely to recur, the Director of Utilities and Engineering may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all violations and
directing the user to:



      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and



      (2)   Take appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.



   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(1980 Code, § 24.1405)  Penalty, see § 51.999



§ 51.255  EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.



   (A)   The Director of Utilities and Engineering may immediately
suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever the
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director of Utilities
and Engineering may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.



      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Director of Utilities and Engineering may take steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
danger to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals.
The Director of Utilities and Engineering may allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Director of Utilities and Engineering that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in § 51.256 of this subchapter
are initiated against the user.



      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of Utilities and
Engineering prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
§ 51.252 or 51.256 of this subchapter.



   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS



§ 51.300  UPSET.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance or careless
or improper operation.



   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (C) below are met.



   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs or other relevant evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and



      (3)   The user has submitted orally the following information
to the Director of Utilities and Engineering within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the upset and the oral statements are confirmed in writing within
five days:



         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause
of noncompliance;



         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and time or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and



         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



   (D)   In any enforcement proceedings, the user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination
on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.



   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.



(1980 Code, § 24.1701)



§ 51.301  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
51.131(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in § 51.131(B)(3)
through (17) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:



   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass through or interference; or



   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge
when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the
case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.



(1980 Code, § 24.1702)



§ 51.302  BYPASS.



   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.



      BYPASS.  The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user’s treatment facility.



      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE.  Substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss or natural resources which can
reasonably be erected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) below of this section.



   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Director of Utilities and Engineering, at
least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.



      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of
Utilities and Engineering of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Director of Utilities and Engineering may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.



   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Utilities
and Engineering may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass,
unless:



         (a)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury or severe property damage;



         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under
division (C) of this section.



      (2)   The Director of Utilities and Engineering may approve,
an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director
of Utilities and Engineering determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

industrial use.  There shall be recognized three classes of private fire
protection for commercial and industrial use. First, those services with
sprinkler heads or fire hydrants with no meter. Second, fire protection
services through a detector check meter, so arranged that there is to be no
consumption from the fire lines except in cases of fire and/or for necessary
testing and inspection. Third, fire protection services through FM-CT fire
meter, so arranged that the regular water consumption is taken from the fire
lines.



   (B)   Services of the first class.  These services may be continued
on the present basis only at the option of the Utilities Department. Abuse of
the private fire protection privileges through appropriation of water for
other purposes or failure to maintain services in a water-tight condition
shall be deemed ample grounds for conversion to one of the other classes.



   (C)   Services of the second class.  The customer is required to
pay for the main tap, service connection, meter well, valves and fitting that
are attached to a detector check meter. The Department will furnish the
customer with the detector check meter of the desired size. The detector
check meter with valves and fittings attached would be picked up at the
Utilities Department by the customer. The customer will also be responsible
for the maintenance, protection and upkeep of the service, well, valves and
fittings, whether constructed by the water or a private contractor. Any
materials used in this maintenance must conform to Utilities Department
specifications.



   (D)   Services of the third class.  The customer is required to pay
for the meter well, valves and fittings that are attached to an FM meter, and
in some cases the main tap and service connection. The Utilities Department
will furnish the customer with the FM-CT meter with a compound bypass meter.
The FM meter and bypass with valves and fittings attached would be picked up
at the Utilities Department by the customer. The customer will also be
responsible for the maintenance, protection and upkeep of the meter well,
valves and fitting whether constructed by the Utilities Department or a
private contractor. Any materials used in this maintenance must conform to
Utilities Department specifications.



   (E)   Private fire services.  The granting of a permit for private
fire service is under the express condition that the city and/or its
Utilities Department shall not be considered or deemed in any manner to have
undertaken to extinguish fire or to protect any person or property against
loss or damage, not being insurers of persons or property, therefore, the
city and its departments shall be free and exempt from any and all claims for
damages on account of any injury to persons or property by reason of fire,
water, failure to supply water or pressure or for any other cause whatsoever.

real estate upon or for which service is supplied whenever the charges or
rates become delinquent. A bill will be considered delinquent if unpaid, in
whole or in part, 60 days after its due date. The lien hereby established
shall have no preference over the rights of any purchases, mortgagee,
judgment creditor or other lien holder arising prior to the filing of the
notice of the lien in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the county in
which the real estate involved is located. The notice shall consist of a
sworn statement by the Director of Utilities and Engineering, an attorney for
the city, the Mayor or City Clerk which sets out:



         (a)   A description of the real estate sufficient for
the identification thereof;



         (b)   The amount of money due for the service; and



         (c)   The date when the amount become delinquent.



      (2)   The city has the power to foreclose this lien in the
same manner and with the same effects as in the foreclosure of mortgages on
real estate. Any member of the Legal Department is authorized to institute
proceedings on behalf of the city.



   (B)   Remedy not exclusive.  The other remedies provided herein
shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The city shall also have the power, from
time to time, to sue the occupant or user of the real estate in a civil
action to recover the money due for services rendered, plus a reasonable
attorney’s fee, to be fixed by the court. Whenever a judgment is obtained
in a civil action, the foregoing provisions in this section with respect to
filing sworn statements of the delinquencies in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds and creating a lien against the real estate shall not be effective
thereafter as to charges sued upon and no lien shall exist thereafter against
the real estate for the delinquency. Judgment in a civil action operates as a
release and waiver of the lien for the amount of the judgment.

contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer’s water system
contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the service
connection into the public water supply system;



      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer’s potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety; and



      (3) To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of
cross connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of
the public and consumer’s potable water systems.



   (B)   Application.  These rules and regulations shall apply to all
premises served by the public potable water supply system of the city.



   (C)   Policy.  The owner or official custodian shall be responsible
for protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to
backflow or back-siphonage of contaminants through the customer’s water
service connection. If, in the judgment of the Director of Utilities and
Engineering or his or her authorized representative, an approved backflow
prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water supply
system, the Director of Utilities and Engineering shall give notice to the
consumer to install the approved backflow prevention device at each service
connection to the premises. The consumer shall immediately install the
approved device or devices at his or her own expense; failure, refusal or
inability on the part of the consumer to install the device or devices
immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the
premises until the device or devices have been installed. The consumer shall
retain records of installation, maintenance, testing and repair as required
in § 52.079(D)(4) for a period of at least five years.

an animal impounded under this division shall be provided written notice of
the impoundment of the animal, which notice shall inform the owner/custodian
of the determination and finding of the Animal Control Officer and/or police
officer and that the owner/custodian shall not have the right to redeem the
animal from impoundment by reason thereof. The owner/custodian of the animal
may appeal the determination and finding to terminate the right to possess
the animal to the Chief of Police, provided that the owner/custodian delivers
a written request for review to the Chief of Police within seven days of the

the termination of the right of possession and redemption of the animal. The
written decision shall be promptly mailed to the owner/custodian (at the
address provided by the owner/custodian) or delivered personally thereto. The
review and/or decision by the Chief of Police shall not stay nor be binding
as to any other prosecution for violations of this code or other laws or
regulations with respect to the animal.

existence of and the spread of rabies throughout the city and its environs
present a danger of the public health, safety and welfare. These provisions

animal and other persons to which the Animal Control Act of the state (ILCS
Ch. 510, Act 5) shall apply, are specifically required to comply with all the

   It shall be unlawful for any person owning or having possession,

public ways, including streets and sidewalks, but only when on a leash not
exceeding ten feet in length and controlled by the owner or keeper of the
animal. If an animal is running at large through the act or intervention of a
third person not a member of the owner’s household and without the

   (B)   Destruction.  In addition to the provisions for destruction
of animals provided under Chapter 90 of the code, in the event any animal is
not reclaimed within the four days of its impoundment, if the owner is known
or the animal is properly tagged, or three days if the owner is not known and
the animal is untagged, the Chief of Police or the Animal Control Officer,
may destroy the animal in the most humane manner practicable, or give or sell
any unclaimed animal. However, in the case of an unclaimed animal whose owner
is unknown, and the third day falls on a day that the facility is not open,
then the animal will not be destroyed, sold or given away until the next
business day.  Any diseased or vicious animal may, however, be destroyed at
any time if the animal cannot be safely taken up or impounded. Any animal
which is so severely injured or diseased that it would be cruel or inhumane
not to destroy the animal, may be destroyed at any time provided that every
reasonable effort is first made to contact to owner of the animal. If the
owner is not known or cannot be located, the decision to destroy the animal
shall be made only after the animal has been examined by Superintendent of
the dog pound. The Chief of Police or the Animal Control Officer may extend
the period if the animal has bitten or scratched any person to determine if
the animal has rabies. In that event, the provisions of the Animal Control
Act of the State of Illinois (ILCS Ch. 510, Act 5, §§ 1 et seq.) shall be
observed.



   (C)   Immunity.  No law enforcement office or agency or licensed
veterinarian shall be held to answer or be liable for damages for the
destruction in any action brought by the owner of the animal when destroyed
in accordance herewith. Provided further that the Animal Control Officer or
his or her designee shall use reasonable diligence to inform the owner of any
animal impounded by mailing a notice to the owner, if known, informing the
owner that his or her animal is being held.



   (D)   Feral animals.  Any feral animal impounded for a period of 72
hours may be destroyed by the Animal Control Officer or a representative of
the city’s designated shelter in a humane manner unless the animal is
claimed. For purposes of this division, a FERAL ANIMAL is one that is
impounded with no identifying collar or tag and, after evaluation by the
Animal Control Officer, is determined to be a wild animal or a domesticated
animal which, through neglect or abandonment, has reverted to a wild state.

object is to be continuing or temporary; and, if temporary, the dates or time
period for which the permit is desired; and



      (7)   Any other information which may be material or is

   (D)   Review of application.  The Building Inspector shall review
all applications for permits and forward the same together with the Building
Inspector’s recommendations to the City Council.



   (E)   Issuance of permit.  If approved by the City Council, the
Building Inspector shall issue a revocable permit in accordance with the
application, but subject to reservations or qualifications as the City
Council may prescribe. In the case of temporary permits, the permit shall
specifically provide that it is limited to a time period specified therein
and, in no event, more than 30 consecutive days. Further temporary permits
may be applied for. Generally, however, temporary permits will not be issued
for a particular location more than 30 days in any 12-month period. Further,
no continuing permit will be granted for any sign, show board, advertisement,
banner, display, awning, canopy or other similar device or object located

other similar publicly owned areas in the city.



   (F)   Permit fees.



      (1)   Generally.  Prior to the issuance of a permit
hereunder, the applicant shall pay to the city a permit fee as herein
provided. The fee shall be collected by the Building Inspector.



      (2)   Continuing permits.  If the device or object contains
any lettering, marks, arrows, symbols, information, directions or
advertisements, the fee for a continuing permit shall be $0.50 per square
foot or fraction thereof of the exposed sides of the sign, show board,
advertisement, banner, display, awning, canopy or other similar device or
object, provided, however, that the fee shall in no event be less than $15.
In determining square feet, the entire device or object as squared off shall
be considered regardless of whether its entire surface contains any
lettering, marks, arrows, symbols, information, directions or advertisements.
If the device or object does not contain any lettering, marks, arrows,
symbols, information, directions or advertisements, the fee shall be $15.



      (3)   Temporary permits.  The fee for a temporary permit
shall be $10 for 30 consecutive days, or any part thereof.



      (4)   Waiver of fee.  The City Council reserves the right to
waive any fees required hereunder if the sign, show board, advertisement,
banner, display, awning, canopy or other similar device or object is to be
erected, placed or located by or for a charitable or not-for-profit
organization or purpose, or otherwise as it shall determine.



   (G)   Change in sign.  No change shall be made to the sign, show
board, advertisement, banner, display, awning, canopy or other similar device
or object permitted so that it is different than that permitted except as
permitted by a new permit. The same fee shall apply for the new permit as
established hereunder for initial permits. In the case of a continuing
permit, a new permit shall not be required, however, because of the transfer
of the real estate to which it applies. Temporary permits, on the other hand,
shall terminate automatically.

the owner or owners of the property to which the same is attached or the

Chief of the Fire Department or the Building Inspector may direct that
remedial actions be taken by the party or parties responsible for the device
or object, which may include, among other remedial actions, the repair or
removal of the device or object. If the hazard determined by the Chief of the
Fire Department or Building Inspector is not remedied within ten days after

the contrary, the Chief of the Fire Department and the Building Inspector may

welfare, including, but not limited to, the immediate removal of the device

and assigns, and, in the case of continuing permits, the owner or owners of
the property to which the same is attached or the permit relates shall be
responsible for any damages which may be incurred as a result of any device
or object. He or she shall further be deemed by the issuance of the permit to
have agreed to hold the city harmless as against any liability. Any
inspections, review or approval of the city are made solely for its internal
purposes only. Neither the city nor its agents and employees shall be liable
for any damages on account of any inspection, review or approval or resulting
from the device or objects.

in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds within 60 days after costs are
incurred, by a sworn statement setting forth the costs of the repair, removal
disposition and the real estate to which the lien applies. The lien shall be
superior to all other liens and encumbrances except taxes. However, the lien
of the city shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose rights in and to the
real estate have arisen subsequent to the removal and prior to the filing of
the notice, and the lien of the city shall not be valid as to any mortgage,
judgment creditor or other lien or notice. Upon payment of the cost and
expense of recordation by the owner of or the persons interested in the

that the law will presume an actionable nuisance;



   (D)   Litter.



      (1)   To dump, deposit, drop, throw, discard, leave, cause or

§ 92.02  NONSUMMARY ABATEMENT NOTICE AND REVIEW.



   (A)   Generally.  The owner, agent, occupant or person in
possession, charge or control of any land, structure, premises, item or
object, real or personally in or upon which any nuisance exists shall be
served a notice to abate the same within a specified reasonable time in a
manner as the notice shall direct or in any other reasonable manner. The time
allowed by the notice shall, in any event, be considered reasonable if seven
days notice is given, except that in the case of nuisances describe in §
92.01(M), (N) and (O), three days notice shall be deemed sufficient in case
of nuisances described in § 92.01(E).



   (B)   Person giving notice.  A notice to abate a nuisance may be
given by the Building Inspector, the Director of Utilities and Engineering,
the Chief of the Police Department, the Chief of the Fire Department, any
assistant or designee of any of the foregoing, any member of the Police
Department, any member of the Fire Department, any person designated by the
Mayor as having authority to give the notice and any other person or officer
of the city possessing police powers.



   (C)   Service of notice.  It shall be considered sufficient to
notify the owner, agent, occupant or person in possession, charge or control
of the land, structure, premises, item or object in or upon which the
nuisance exists in person or by ordinary mail sent to the owner of the
premises as disclosed in the current tax records of the county. A notice
shall be deemed sufficient although the person to which it is directed
refused delivery of the same or it is not deliverable. The notice shall be
presumed delivered if not returned to the city as not deliverable. In the
event the owner, agent, occupant or person in possession, charge or control
of the land, structure, premises, item or object is unknown or on reasonable
search is not ascertainable, it shall be sufficient to give notice by posting
on the premises. If notice is served on anyone other than the owner as shown
in the tax records of the county, a copy thereof shall be delivered
personally to the owner or sent by ordinary mail to the owner at the same
time as notice is given to the other person. If any nuisance relates to an
unfit, unsafe or dangerous structure, a copy of the notice shall also be sent
to any lien holders of record, provided the lack of the notice not affect any
proceedings hereunder.



   (D)   Contents of notice.  Every notice served under this chapter
shall, in addition to requiring the abatement of the nuisance, state the
proposed method of abatement and warn the person to which the notice is
directed that a failure to accomplish the abatement within the time stated
herein may result in the abatement of the nuisance by the city and that the
cost or expenses related to the removal by the city shall be charged to the
person. The proposed method of abatement shall not limit the method of
abatement to be used.



   (E)   Posting property.



      (1)   Any real or personal property relative to which a notice
has or is about to be given may be posted advising that the property has been
declared a nuisance, has been condemned, has been declared dangerous and
unsafe or has been declared unsafe for human occupancy or use. The form of
notice shall be determined by the person giving the notice. No person shall
remove any sign or poster without the permission of the person posting the
notice, or if unknown, the Director of Utilities and Engineering, the
Building Inspector or any assistant of the Building Inspector.



      (2)   It shall be a violation of this code for any person to
use or occupy any real or personal property which has been posted as unsafe
for human occupancy or use in accordance herewith. Any person lawfully
entitled to use, possession or occupancy of the property may seek review of
the posting with the Director of Planning and Development as provided in
division (F) below.



   (F)   Review.  When a person shall have received a notice to abate
a nuisance under these provisions, he, she or any other materially interested
person, shall have the right to have the notice reviewed in accordance with
this division.



      (1)   Director of Planning and Development.  Any person who
or which has received a notice to abate a nuisance, or other materially
interested person, may within the time prescribed in the notice file a
written request with the Director of Planning and Development that the
Director review the notice, stating the reason or reasons why the act,
conduct, circumstance or condition referred to in the notice does not
constitute a nuisance. The written notice must have been received by the
Director of Planning and Development or in the Director’s office prior to
the period set forth in the notice or the first late of the Director’s
office is open for business after the date if closed on the date. Mailing the
notice on the date shall be insufficient. The Director of Planning and
Development, or another person designated by the Director, shall promptly
give the person an opportunity to personally be heard and present whatever
information as he or she considers pertinent. After reviewing the
determination, the Director of Planning and Development or designee may
revoke the notice, modify the notice or allow the notice to stand,
prescribing a subsequent date within which the nuisance should be abated, not
less than seven days following the decision of the Director of Planning and
Development or designee.



      (2)   Judicial determination.  If the person does not agree
with the decision of the Director of Planning and Development or designee,
the person may within the subsequent period designated by the Director of
Planning and Development or designee notify the Director of Planning and
Development and the person who gave the original notice to abate nuisance
that he or she does not agree with the decision made. In that event, the
person shall be charged with the violation of this chapter, if not already
charged. The existence or nonexistence of a nuisance will then be determined
in conjunction with the disposition of the charge. Review by the Director of
Planning and Development or designee may be waived in writing. In that event,
a judicial determination shall be pursued as if the review had been pursued.



      (3)   Stay.  Pending any review under the previous provisions
and the disposition of a charge (if the review proceedings have been
pursued), a nuisance shall not be abated by the city except when summary
abatement is authorized or becomes authorized as the nuisance becomes more
substantive or aggravated or otherwise warrants summary abatement. The review
provisions herein contained shall in no way limit the right of the city or an
officer of the city to abate a nuisance summarily under the provisions of
this chapter or as otherwise may be allowed by law or by nonsummary abatement
after notice if the review proceedings are not pursued. It is intended that
under the circumstances, action may be taken to abate a nuisance immediately
or without disposition of a charge, if filed.



(1980 Code, § 21.102)  (Ord. 9035, passed 4-18-2005)  Penalty, see § 92.99



§ 92.03  NONSUMMARY ABATEMENT.



   (A)   Review not sought.  If a nuisance is not timely abated after
notice is given in accordance with this chapter and review of the notice is
not sought, the city may immediately proceed to abate or remove the nuisance
after the time limit stated in the notice has expired irrespective of whether
a charge is filed alleging violation of this chapter. It is intended that
nonsummary abatement will be delayed only if review of a notice is timely
sought.



   (B)   Review sought.  If review of the notice is sought and a
nuisance is not abated prior to completion of the review process and the
disposition of the charge, the city may immediately proceed to abate a
nuisance if the person is found guilty, pleads guilty or is placed on
supervision after a plea of guilty whether or not ultimately accepted by the
court. The court may on motion enter any appropriate orders regarding
abatement of the nuisance, including, but not necessarily limited to, an
order directing that the person be provided an additional reasonable time to
abate the nuisance, an order modifying the method of abatement proposed by
the city, an order specifically authorizing the city to proceed with the
abatement of the nuisance, an order directing the person to abate the
nuisance or an order restraining the person from continuing the nuisance in
the future.



   (C)   Methods of abatement.



      (1)   If abatement, is authorized under this chapter, the city
may abate or remove the nuisance in any and all of the following manners,
except as may be otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction:



         (a)   Proceeding to abate or remove the nuisance using
city employees or others in any reasonable manner. In the case of a
structure, abatement may, as appropriate, be by demolition or repair of a
structure or causing the demolition or repair or a structure;



         (b)   Any other manner allowed by law or in equity or
reasonable under the circumstances; or



         (c)   Any manner authorized by a court of competent
jurisdiction.



      (2)   The proposed method of abatement shall not limit the
method of abatement which may be used unless otherwise ordered by the court
or diminish the discretion of the court to order that the person charged
abate a nuisance or enter any other appropriate order.



(1980 Code, § 21.103)  Penalty, see § 92.99



§ 92.04  SUMMARY ABATEMENT.



   Whenever, in the opinion of the officer of the city entitled to give
notice pursuant to this chapter, the maintenance or continuation of nuisance
creates an imminent threat of serious or unreasonable injury to persons or
serious or unreasonable damage to personal or real property, the officer may
immediately proceed to abate the nuisance in any reasonable manner if
circumstances do not allow implementation or full implementation of
nonsummary abatement procedures. Whenever the owner, occupant, agent or
person in possession, charge or control of the real or personal property
which has become a nuisance is unknown or cannot readily be found or
circumstances do not allow, the officer may proceed to abate the nuisance
without notice. Any reasonable order may be entered by the official to abate
a nuisance summarily when circumstances require and may include, but shall
not be limited to, prohibiting occupancy of a structure. A copy of the order
or other notice thereof may be posted on the real or personal property
involved. It shall be unlawful for any person to disobey, remove or deface
any order or notice. Where the abatement of the nuisance requires continuing
acts by the corporate authorities beyond the initial summary abatement or any
other additional summary abatements, it may seek abatement of the nuisance on
a permanent basis through the nonsummary procedures as soon as reasonably
possible.



(1980 Code, § 21.104)  Penalty, see § 92.99



§ 92.05  COSTS OF ABATEMENT.



   (A)   Generally.  Whenever the city is required to abate or remove
a nuisance pursuant to this chapter or as otherwise allowed by ordinances of
the city, the costs of expenses shall be a lien on the property to which they
apply. If the property is personal property, the lien shall be on the real
estate on which or at which the personal property is located. The city may
collect the costs and expenses thereof in accordance with this section or by
use of the Local Debt Recovery Program administered by the State of Illinois.



   (B)   Notice of cost.  Within 60 days after the costs or expenses
are incurred to abate or remove a nuisance, the City Treasurer or the
Treasurer’s designee shall give, or cause to be given, a statement
notifying the person to whom or which the notice to abate a nuisance was
sent, setting forth the cost or expenses incurred by the city to abate or
remove the nuisance. It shall be considered sufficient to give the statement
personally or by ordinary mail sent to the same address as the original
notice. If the owner, occupant, agent or person in possession, charge or
control of the real or personal property cannot be ascertained, even from the
tax records of the county, the statement may be posted on the premises.



   (C)   Certification.  If the statement is not paid within 30 days
after the date thereof, the City Treasurer may certify the same to the County
Clerk of the county or place the matter for collection with the Local Debt
Recovery Program administered by the State of Illinois. If seeking a lien,
the certification shall be filed not later than December 31 following the
expiration of the 30-day period. The certification shall contain, to the best
of the knowledge and belief of the City Treasurer, the name of the owner of
the real estate as disclosed on the tax records of the county, a description
of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof, the real estate tax
number of the real estate and the amount of the costs and expenses incurred.
In determining the last date for filing the certification, the last date of
payment within the 30 days prescribed shall apply rather than the date the
work is performed or the notice originally given. The amount so certified
shall be deemed to be levied by the city as an individual assessment against
the property involved. No further action need be taken by the corporate
authorities to levy the amount.



   (D)   Extension of assessment.  The County Clerk of the county
shall extend, in the same manner as other taxes relative to real estate, an
individual assessment equal to the total of the amount certified to the
County Clerk by the Treasurer of the city. The assessment shall be collected
in the same manner as other taxes and paid to the city.



   (E)   Recorded notice of assessment.  In addition to filing the
above certificate with the County Clerk, the Treasurer, if not collecting
through the Local Debt Recovery Program administered by the State of
Illinois, shall cause a notice of the assessment to be filed in the office of
the Recorder of Deeds in the county at that time. The notice shall certify
the description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof and
the amount of the assessment. The recorded copy of the certification to the
County Clerk shall be considered sufficient.



   (F)   Bona fide purchasers.  The claim of the city pursuant to
these provisions shall not be valid as to any purchasers for good and
sufficient value and without notice whose rights in and to the real estate
have arisen subsequent to the abatement or removal of the nuisance and prior
to the filing of the notice with the Recorder of Deeds in the county. If the
City Treasurer is notified of the existence of a bona fide purchaser for
value, the Treasurer, or the Treasurer’s designee, shall, if satisfied that
the purchaser is bona fide, abate the individual assessment. The assessment
may also be abated if earlier paid. Notice of abatement shall be filed with
the County Clerk and Recorder of Deeds of the county. The abatement shall not
terminate any claim against the prior owner of the real estate.



   (G)   Other remedies.  The above divisions shall not limit any
other remedies of the city to collect costs or expenses. A court may, when
considering a charge of violating this chapter, order payment of the charges
incurred by the city. The city may also enforce a lien as in cases of
foreclosure.



   (H)   Determination of costs.  The determination of costs of
abatement shall be made by the Director of Planning and Development. The
determination shall equal the actual costs of abatement or removal, provided
that the costs, if performed by employees of the city, shall not be less than
$60 per man-hour or part thereof. The costs of abatement shall also include
the actual costs of mailing or serving documents, recording documents and any
other incidental expenses.

§ 92.06  IMMUNITY.



   Neither the city nor any person abating or removing a nuisance pursuant
to this chapter or engaged in any matters related to the operations of this
chapter shall be held to answer or be liable for any damage for an action
brought by the owner, agent, occupant, person in possession charge or control
of the property involved or others. This immunity shall be in addition to any
immunity otherwise existing by law.



(1980 Code, § 21.106)



§ 92.07  OTHER REMEDIES.



   This chapter shall not limit any other rights or remedies of the city
provided in this code or any other ordinance, statute, law, rule or
regulation regarding the subject matter of this chapter. These remedies are
deemed cumulative.



(1980 Code, § 21.107)



§ 92.08  PRACTICE.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a prompt and efficient means
of abating or having abated nuisances within the city. It is not intended
that this chapter shall affect or regulate practice before the courts of the
state.



(1980 Code, § 21.108)



§ 92.99  PENALTY.



   In addition to any other relief which may be granted under this chapter
or otherwise, any person, firm or corporation who or which violates any of
the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to other relief as the law
may afford, be punishable as set forth in § 10.99 of this code. A violation
may be charged under the provisions of this chapter regardless of whether a
notice to abate a nuisance has been given or whether the time to abate the
nuisance has expired. It shall be sufficient in charging a violation of this
chapter to merely cite “Section 92.01 (Nuisance)” or some equivalent,
provided a court may direct that more specific pleadings be filed.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 126.001  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.



   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish
policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within
the city’s jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with
the preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual qualities of the
city rights-of-way and the city as a whole.



   (B)   Intent.  In enacting this chapter, the city intends to
exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular,
the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform
standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including
without limitation:



      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks,
alleys, parkways and other public ways and places;



      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions
and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;



      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations
of the city’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in
rights-of-way or public property;



      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage
to trees, from the installation of utility facilities;



      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to
structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces;



      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which
facilities are installed;



      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined
parkways that characterize the city’s residential neighborhoods;



      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of
facilities in the rights-of-way; and



      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private
properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.



   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter.  This chapter applies to
all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the
rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and
located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement.



   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements.  The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating its
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into an
agreement may request that the city enter into an agreement. In an agreement,
the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this chapter.



   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.



      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers.  In
the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the city, the franchise, license
or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of the
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



      (2)   Telecommunications providers.  In the event of any
conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and
the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the
city and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of the franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of the
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.



   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters.  This chapter supersedes all
chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith, to the extent of the conflict.



   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws.  In the event that
applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the
requirements of this chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements
of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or
state laws or regulations.



   (H)   Sound engineering judgment.  The city shall use sound
engineering judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the
standards, conditions and requirements expressed in this chapter when the
city so determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of
the city to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public
health, safety and welfare.

impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the
rights-of-way.



   (B)   Duration.  No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid
for a period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.



   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required.  No construction shall
begin pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by
the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform
any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
the city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
Director of Utilities and Engineering may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, waive the pre-construction meeting due to the small size and/or
minor complexity of the project. The meeting shall be for the purpose of
reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.



   (D)   Compliance with all laws required.  The issuance of a permit
by the city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations.

§ 126.019  REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.



   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate
from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit
also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with § 126.058 of this chapter. If the
city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it
conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

INSURANCE, INDEMNIFICATION AND SECURITY



§ 126.035  INSURANCE.



   (A)   Required coverages and limits.



      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license or
similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any
facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following
liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming
the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents and
employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions
(A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:



         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including
premises-operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly
referred to as “X,” “C” and “U” coverages) and products-completed
operations coverage with limits not less than:



            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or
death to each person;



            2.   Five million dollars for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and



            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of
liability;



         (b)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and
hired vehicles with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;



         (c)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and



         (d)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of
not less than $1,000,000 per employee and per accident.



      (2)   If the utility is not providing the insurance to protect
the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then the contractors
and subcontractors shall comply with this section.



   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies.  The coverages required by this
section may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies.
Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying
insurance on a following-form basis so that when any loss covered by the
primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or
umbrella policy becomes effective to cover the loss.



   (C)   Copies required.  The utility shall provide copies of any of
the policies required by this section to the city within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the city.



   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.



      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall
contain the following endorsement:



         It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not
be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after
receipt by the city, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the City Mayor and Director of
Utilities and Engineering of the intent to cancel or not to renew.



      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of the notice,
and in no event later than ten days prior to the cancellation, the utility
shall obtain and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance
policies meeting the requirements of this section.



   (E)   Self-insurance.  A utility may self-insure all or a portion
of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of
this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of
the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of
additional insureds under division (A) above or the requirements of divisions
(B), (C) and (D) above of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required
under division (A) above of this section, such as evidence that the utility
is a private self insurer under the Workers Compensation Act.



   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s
liability.  The legal liability of the utility to the city and any person
for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or
self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by insurance
policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.



   (G)   Insurance companies.  All insurance provided pursuant to this
section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by
insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state.

§ 126.036  INDEMNIFICATION.



   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility
shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its
elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting
from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or
wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether the acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a
franchise, license or similar agreement; provided, however, that the
utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by the
city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.



(1980 Code, § 30.1101.9)  (Ord. 9122, passed 3-11-2008)  Penalty, see §
126.999



§ 126.037  SECURITY.



   (A)   Purpose.  The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a
form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall
be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the
permittee’s sole cost and expense until the completion of the work
authorized under the permit. The Security Fund shall serve as security for:



      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the
requirements of this chapter;



      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the city
occasioned by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant
to this chapter; and



      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration
work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the city must
perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s
failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the city from the
permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.



   (B)   Form.  The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the
city in the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant
to this division shall, at a minimum:



      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior
notice to the city and the permittee;



      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the
collection by the city of any amounts covered by it; and



      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and
within the state at which it can be drawn.



   (C)   Amount.  The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Utilities and
Engineering, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the
city estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform
the restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the
permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the city, with
each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a
related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not
be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous
phase or phases, the Director of Utilities and Engineering may, in the
exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this division for any single phase.



   (D)   Withdrawals.  The city, upon 14 days advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for the amount within
the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:



      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the
permittee hereunder;



      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that
are due and unpaid;



      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason
of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or



      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that
the city determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.



   (E)   Replenishment.  Within 14 days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified
in division (C) above of this section.



   (F)   Interest.  The permittee may request that any and all
interest accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the
permittee by the city, upon written request for the withdrawal to the city,
provided that any withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the
minimum balance required in division (C) of this section.



   (G)   Closing and return of security fund.  Upon completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the Security Fund, or a portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the city to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result
of the revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of the costs, loss or
damage shall be refunded to the permittee.



   (H)   Rights not limited.  The rights reserved to the city with
respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the city,
whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no
action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to the Security Fund
shall affect any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the city shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with
respect to any of its rights, which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

§ 126.038  CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER’S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.



   (A)   Notification of change.  A utility shall notify the city no
less than 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the
utility or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed
by the former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to
the work and facilities in the right-of-way.



   (B)   Amended permit.  A new owner shall request that any current
permit be amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a
new or amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to
have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the
permit if the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the
city’s right-of-way.



   (C)   Insurance and bonding.  All required insurance coverage or
bonding must be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

STANDARDS



§ 126.050  GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.



   (A)   Standards and principles.  All construction in the
right-of-way shall be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws
rules and regulations, and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control
and construction principles, sound engineering judgment and, where
applicable, the principles and standards set forth in the following IDOT
publications, latest editions, as amended from time to time:

§ 126.052  LOCATION OF FACILITIES.



   (A)   General requirements.  In addition to location requirements
applicable to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities,
regardless of type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of
this division.



      (1)   Minimum interference with city facilities. No utility
facilities shall be placed in any location if the Director of Utilities and
Engineering determines that the proposed location will require the relocation
or displacement of any of the city’s utility facilities or will otherwise
interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the city’s utility
facilities.



      (2)   Minimum interference and impact.  The proposed location
shall cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of the
right-of-way and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and
interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners
who adjoin the right-of-way.



      (3)   No interference with travel.  No utility facility shall
be placed in any location that interferes with the usual travel on the
right-of-way.



      (4)   No limitations on visibility.  No utility facility
shall be placed in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of
the right-of-way.



      (5)   Size of utility facilities.  The proposed installation
shall use the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power
pedestals and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of
location, for the particular application.



   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.



      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities.  An overhead parallel
facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:



         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the
right-of-way line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as
reasonable pole alignment will permit;



         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as
practicable from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind
the face of the curb, where available;



         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote

accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be
expeditiously accomplished.



      (2)   Damage to trees.  Poor pruning practices resulting in
damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for
cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The
city will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees
removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International
Society of Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the
compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may
require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning
would leave them in an unacceptable condition.



   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance.  The city
may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or
trees of special significance. The required measures may consist of higher

city, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate
authorities have determined that the removal, relocation, change or
alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance
or installation of any city improvement in or upon, or the operations of the
city in or upon, the rights-of-way.



   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities.  Within 30 days following
written notice from the city, any utility that owns, controls or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of the facilities or
appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject
to removal in the following circumstances:



      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s
license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;



      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the
prior grant of a license or franchise, if required;



      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without
prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or



      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a
location not permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.



   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities.  The city
retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within
the rights-of-way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary,
appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency.

utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify
the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.



   (D)   Abandonment of facilities.  Upon abandonment of a facility
within the rights-of-way of the city, the utility shall notify the city
within 90 days. Following receipt of the notice the city may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Director of
Utilities and Engineering determines that the removal will be in the best
interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the city
does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by
giving notice of abandonment to the city, the abandoning utility shall be
deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the
facility by another utility or person.

noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit.



      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion
of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all
necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the
right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a
hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in
repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on
the shoulder in an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of
access to the facility is available.



      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible,
notify the Director of Utilities and Engineering or his or her duly
authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have
been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required
to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to
interfere with the free movement of traffic, the city police shall be
notified immediately.



      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand
to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.



   (C)   Emergency repairs.  The utility must file in writing with the

or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.



      (7)   Alternate placements.



         (a)   Except as provided in this Collocation
Requirements and Conditions Section, a wireless provider shall not be
required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility
pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple
antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an
application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with
a new utility pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be
collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure
within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept
if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose
technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.



         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by
the city, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the
property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate
location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.

§ 126.118  HOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENT.



   It is recognized that the system being created by the wireless
facilities network requires an interconnection and complete coverage for the
system to function. It is also recognized that during events, weather
conditions, traffic accidents and maintenance and construction operations
sometimes cause damage to roadway facilities within rights-of-way including
city-owned infrastructure. Although replacement, reconstruction or
re-installation of this infrastructure is typically accomplished in as
efficiently, timely and economically a manner as possible, there is no
defined timeframe in which this repair work is completed. In the event such
incidents occur causing damage to city-owned infrastructure which have
wireless telecommunication facilities mounted or otherwise attached to them,
and in the event such accidents or occurrences cause elements of or the
complete wireless telecommunication facility to be incapacitated, rendered
inoperable, made irreparable, or destroyed, the city and its associated
Departments, elected and appointed officials, employees, and agents shall be
held harmless and under no obligation to replace, reconstruct or re-install
the roadway facilities within a certain time frame or to the same
configuration or condition, nor shall there be any obligation by the city to
repair, reconfigure or replace any elements of the wireless telecommunication
facility. Such duties and responsibilities for the repair, reconfiguration or
replacement of the wireless facility shall rest solely and at the expense of
the wireless services provider. A wireless provider has no obligation to
indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due
to or caused by the sole negligence of the authority or its employees or it
agents.

to comply with any of the provisions of §§ 126.001 through 126.058 shall be
subject to a fine of $750 per occurrence. There may be times when the city
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
city’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining,
modifying, relocating or removing the facility that is the subject of the
permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a
permit related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon
a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

revocation of the license may be appealed to the Director of Planning and
Development. Any appeal must be in writing and received by or delivered to

the Building Inspector. The Director of Planning and Development, or another
person designated by the Director, shall promptly give the license an
opportunity to personally be heard and present relevant or pertinent
information which the licensee believes warrants reconsideration of the
decision of the Building Inspector. After each opportunity, the Director of

Fire Department and the City Inspection Office.



   (B)   General procedure.



      (1)   An appropriate permit shall be obtained from the

contractor, individual or other business seeking a permit shall complete the
required application for the permit, in the form and manner as prescribed by
the Inspection Office. The City Fire Department and the Inspection Office
shall have the authority to make the inquiry and to obtain additional
information as is necessary to review and process the application for
demolition or salvage permit, including making inquiry with the City Police
Department or other sources.

different meaning.



            SALVAGE.  The removal of exterior or interior
fixtures, trim, doors, windows, porches, structural components, flooring and
significant architectural or historical features prior to demolition of the
structure with the intent of reuse or re-sale. Excluded from this definition
is the removal of materials incidental to or made necessary by, the
demolition process. Also excluded from this definition are salvage operations
that are part of or associated with building re-habilitation, remodeling,
renovation or other construction operations allowed by a proper building
permit.



      (3)   (a)   Building demolition operations shall require a
demolition permit at a cost stipulated in § 162.210(B)(1)(d) and (B)(2)(c)
of the city code.



         (b)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



            DEMOLITION.  The leveling or dismantling of a

process and whose removal delays the demolition process.



      (4)   After receipt and filing of a completed application for
demolition or salvage permit, the Building Official shall promptly cause a
copy of the application to be forwarded to the City Fire Department for
review.



      (5)   The City Fire Department and the Inspection Office shall
perform independent follow-up inspections of the building at the proposed
demolition site to verify the information provided in the application and to
determine whether or not a waiver of the requirement of an on-site fire
protection guard is warranted.



      (6)   Subject to emergencies or other situations beyond the
control of the City Fire Department and the Inspection Office, a decision as
to whether or not a waiver of the requirement of a fire protection guard is
warranted shall be made within a reasonably prompt time, generally two
business days, after receipt and filing of the application for demolition
permit.



   (C)   Failure to provide information and denial of demolition or
salvage permit.  Should a contractor, individual or other business seeking a
demolition permit fail to provide complete and accurate information as is
required by the City Fire Department and the Inspection Office, sufficient
and reasonable grounds exist for immediate denial of a demolition/salvage
permit, or revocation of any permit previously issued.



   (D)   Issuance of demolition permit.



      (1)   Neither a demolition or salvage permit shall be granted

Inspection Office to allow the City Preservation Commission sufficient time
to survey, review, comment and document the subject property and to conduct a

thereafter submit a report to the Director of Planning and Development and
the City Council, unless the review period is waived in writing by the
Commission.



         (a)   Exception; city notice to owner to demolish.  In
the event a property has been declared unsafe and dangerous by the city and a
nuisance abatement notice is given to the owner to demolish or repair the
nuisance structure, then the period provided above for review by the City
Preservation Commission shall commence from the time the Preservation
Commission is provided with a copy of the nuisance abatement notice (or other
notice from the city that the nuisance structure is to be demolished). If the
notice has been provided to the Preservation Commission, it shall not be
necessary to provide further notice to the Commission of any application to
demolish (by the owner) or of direct demolition by the city.

            1.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the period for review by the Preservation Commission may be waived
upon the concurrence of the Building Inspector and the Fire Chief that a
structure constitutes an imminent threat of serious injury or damage to
persons or property that it should be demolished in a manner consistent with
the summary nuisance abatement provisions of § 92.04 of the municipal code
provided that the Preservation Commission receive notice from the Building
Inspector of the summary demolition as soon as is practicable, and nothing
herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict the power or authority of the
city to summarily abate nuisances in accordance therewith.



            2.   An order of summary demolition shall preclude
the issuance of a salvage permit.



      (3)   For any individual or contributing property nominated or

landmarks or contributing properties in a designated City Local Historic
District.



   (G)   Revocation of waiver.  Regardless of the granting of a waiver
for the requirement of the placement of a fire protection guard, if, in the
opinion of the City Fire Department and the Inspection Office, the
circumstances have materially changed or other appropriate circumstances
exist, any waiver may be revoked upon notice. In that event, the provisions
relating to the placement of an on-site fire protection guard shall be

DEMOLITION PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Consent to inspect.  The receipt and filing of an application
for a demolition or salvage permit or the issuance of either permit shall be
deemed to provide the necessary consent and authority for any member of the
City Fire Department and Inspection Office and other departments or other
city personnel, including members of the City Preservation Commission, to
inspect any building or structure subject to the demolition/salvage permit
prior to or during the demolition or salvage process. In addition to other
duties required of them, the City Fire Department and the Inspection Office

or business granted the demolition or salvage permit shall have the duty and
responsibility of securing the building and structure at night or at any
other times when demolition is not in active progress or when demolition

vigilant in safeguarding the building or structure from fire or other
hazards. Securing the building or structure and site shall include, but shall
not be limited to, covering up holes at the completion of each work day and
securing doors, windows and other access points or otherwise preventing
access to the building interior and, in addition to the fencing requirements
under § 3303 of Chapter 33 of the International Building Code (2000)

fence of wood, metal or plastic construction around the perimeter of the
demolition site as far back from the demolition site as is practicable, with
vertical supports every six to eight feet and horizontal supports adequate to

minimum height of four feet in height. The duty to secure the structure and
site shall exist whether or not a waiver of the requirement of placement of a
fire protection guard is granted.



   (C)   Duty to protect others from injury during the demolition
process.  During the active demolition or salvage process, appropriate
measures shall be taken to prevent danger or injury to human life or to the
public welfare. Adequate lighting, guard railings, temporary sidewalks and
proper scaffolding and fencing shall be utilized so as to protect others from
injury. Rubble causing dust so as to cause a nuisance shall be adequately
sprinkled and the general work area shall be maintained and cleaned. Other
actions may be required as are appropriate so as to protect the health,
safety and welfare of others during the active demolition process. A minimum
of two workers shall be on the demolition site when heavy equipment is in use
or, is otherwise operating. Heavy equipment at a demolition site shall
contain proper back-up lights and signals and other appropriate safety

   (E)   Use of cutting torches and similar equipment.  When cutting
torches or similar equipment are used in the demolition process, the
contractor, individual or other business provided the demolition or salvage
permit and any workers involved in the demolition/salvage process shall
appropriately and adequately monitor the area where torches and other similar
equipment issued for at least one hour after the usage so as to ensure that
no fire exists or will develop in any wall or floor or other associated area.
The use of cutting torches or similar equipment shall give rise to a duty to
inspect and make safe the area where the equipment is being used.



   (F)   Placement of on-site fire protection guard.  At least one
fire protection guard shall be on duty at the end of the demolition workday
until work commences the next day. A fire protection guard shall be on site
during the weekend, holidays and at any other time where no active work is in
progress. Where appropriate, the City Fire Department may order the placement
of a fire protection guard regardless of the time or presence of workers
on-site should it be necessary under the circumstances to prevent fire or
where an immediate threat of arson exists



   (G)   Starting and completion of the demolition/salvage process. 
The start of the demolition or salvage process shall begin when permitted
operations are initiated, or when all of the utilities are disconnected from
the building or structure or are otherwise not in service, or a permit has
been issued, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding this provision, the City
Fire Department or the Inspection Office may in its discretion notify the
demolition contractor, individual or other business that the
demolition/salvage process has begun regardless of the removal of utility
service. Utility service used to assist in demolition/salvage shall in no way
delay the existence of the start of demolition or salvage. The completion of
the demolition process shall exist when both the City Fire Department and the
Inspection Office sign off, in writing, that the process is completed.



   (H)   Stop order and revocation of demolition permit.  The
Inspection Office or the City Fire Department may order the demolition or
salvage of a building or structure to be delayed or stopped if any unsafe or
health hazard condition exists or develops during the approved process or
where any ordinance of the city is deemed to have been violated. A demolition
or salvage permit may be revoked for failure to comply with any ordinances or
any other applicable state or federal statutes or regulations. In addition to
any other remedies provided, where a stop order is issued or where a
demolition permit is revoked, a new permit will be required containing
appropriate terms and conditions and an additional fee as prescribed in §
162.210(B) of this code will be required for the additional demolition or
salvage permit.



   (I)   Extermination.  Demolitions/salvages may be preceded by an
inspection of the premises by the Building Inspector to determine whether
extermination procedures are necessary. If the premises are found to be
infested by mice, rats or other vermin, appropriate extermination measures to
prevent the spread of infestation to adjoining or other areas shall be
carried out before, during and after demolition or salvage. Regardless of
this inspection, it shall be required that appropriate removal procedures be
implemented prior to the start of work to rid the building or structure of
any infestation or vermin, including rats or mice, or other animals or
insects of whatever type or kind.



   (J)   Completion of demolition projects.  All demolition projects
shall be completed within 30 days from the issuance of a demolition permit.
At the time of issuance of a demolition permit, the Inspection Office may
extend this time as is appropriate without an additional fee for major
demolition projects which by their nature can not be completed within 30
days. For all other projects, the Inspection Office may grant an extension
for completion of a demolition project based on good cause and the paying of

to be left at grade level, free and clear of any debris or building
materials. The foundation shall be removed to six inches below grade level.
Materials which are not salvageable shall be disposed of in an approved,
licensed landfill. If the property is to be used for a parking lot, it shall
be paved with a hard surface such as oil and chip, asphalt or concrete within
one year of demolition completion. If the property is not to be used for a
parking lot, it shall be graded and sowed with grass seed.



   (M)   Incorporation of IBC.  Any supplemental provisions of the
International Building Code, or any applicable ordinances as amended and
adopted for the city are hereby incorporated in this chapter and shall be
observed during the demolition process.

   SFHA.  See definition of FLOODPLAIN.



   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  Includes substantial improvement and means the
date the building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or
other improvement, was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on
a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles,
the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a substantial
improvement, actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.



   STRUCTURE.  See definition of BUILDING.



   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cumulative percentage of damage during a ten-year period equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and
materials must be included in this determination. The term includes
REPETITIVE LOSS BUILDINGS (see definition).



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.



      (1)   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a structure taking place during a ten-year period in which the
cumulative percentage of improvements:



         (a)   Equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started; or



         (b)   Increases the floor area by more than 20%.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.



      (2)   The term does not include:



         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to
comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or



         (b)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic
Places.



   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the required federal, state, and/ or
local permits and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation
until such time as the documentation is provided.

facilities shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the
floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities
constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated or structurally dry floodproofed to the 500-year flood frequency
elevation or three feet above the level of the 100-year flood frequency
elevation whichever is greater. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be
taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released
into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base
flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities.



   (B)   All other activities defined as development shall be designed
so as not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages.

§ 155.10  CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION.



   For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream
maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the city shall notify adjacent
communities in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the
alteration or relocation of the watercourse.



(Ord. 9183, passed 5-16-2011) 



§ 155.11  VARIANCES.



   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Building
Commission for a variance. The Building Commission shall review the
applicant’s request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to
the City Council. The City Council may attach such conditions to granting of
a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.



   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that all of the following conditions are met:



      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the
floodplain;



      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance
were not granted;



      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;



      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or
safely, or creation of a nuisance;



      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood
protection, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads,
utilities or other public facilities;



      (6)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not
establish a pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and



      (7)   All other required state and federal permits have been
obtained.



   (B)   The Building Commission shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of
§ 155.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:



      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up
to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;



      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and



      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of
these risks and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of
the risk and liability.



   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of § 155.07
of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair
or alteration of an historic site or historic structure included on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic
Places may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
§§ 155.06 and 155.07 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:



      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure; and



      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the
structure being removed as a certified historic structure.



   (D)   Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be
decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions
as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this ordinance. In
order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and
wet-floodproofed:



      (1)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance
from the floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate
that the varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and
no other alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists
for the agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.



      (2)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to
agricultural purposes in zone A only as identified on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).



      (3)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural
structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e.,
foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring and the
like) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant
materials in accordance with § 155.07 of this chapter.



      (4)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with § 155.07 of this chapter. All of the building’s structural
components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces
including hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.



      (5)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment
must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they
are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with § 155.07 of this
chapter.



      (6)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls,
subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with § 155.07(B) of
this chapter.



      (7)   The agricultural structures must comply with the
floodplain management floodway provisions of § 155.06 of this chapter. No
variances may be issued for agricultural structures within any designated
floodway.



      (8)   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be
reviewed and approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered
professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain
development permit for construction.

§ 155.12  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.



   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.

§ 155.13  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.



   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City
Council to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including but not necessarily limited to, Ordinances 8073, 8250, 8570, 8589
and 8656. However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or
ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this
chapter repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants or
deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.

§ 155.99  PENALTY.



   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure
to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be
a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Director of
Utilities and Engineering may determine that a violation of the minimum
standards of this chapter exists. The Director of Utilities and Engineering
shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.



   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the
violation:



      (1)   The city may make application to the Circuit Court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;



      (2)   Any person, firm or corporation who or which violates
any of the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to such other relief
as the law may afford, be subject to punishment as provided in § 10.99.
Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action to
prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue
to the person or persons responsible;



      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues; and/or



      (4)   The city may record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.



   (B)   (1)   The Director of Utilities and Engineering shall
inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to
increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood
Insurance Policy to be suspended. The Director of Utilities and Engineering
is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject
development. The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for
the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the
circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order constitutes
a suspension of the permit. No site development permit shall be permanently
suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the Building Commission.
Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall
state:



         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for
suspension or revocation; and



         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.



      (2)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Building Commission shall determine whether the permit shall be
suspended or revoked.



   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 161.12  FINAL PLAT SECURITY.



   (A)   Security. The infrastructure improvements required by this
chapter shall be installed prior to the approval and recording of the final
plat. Water lines and sewer lines need to be installed and streets paving
completed with the minimum being all but the final surface course layer of
asphalt before the final plat is approved. If other improvements have not
been completed and approved by the Director of Engineering before the final
plat is submitted to the city, the applicant shall enter into an agreement
with the Director of Engineering for the deposit of funds securing 125% of
the estimated construction costs for completion of the required
infrastructure improvements, based upon the prevailing wage rate then
currently in effect for the city. The estimate of construction cost shall be
provided by the developer's engineer of record. The agreement shall remain in
effect until the Director of Engineering certifies completion of all required
infrastructure improvements. All improvements must be completed within two
years from the date of the agreement. If the infrastructure is not completed
upon expiration of the agreement, the developer shall forfeit all sums
necessary for the completion of the required public infrastructure
improvements to the city. The city will decide how to proceed with the
required improvements with the forfeited funds.



   (B)   Security for such requirements may include:



      (1)   A performance bond securing an amount equal to or
exceeding 125% of the estimated construction costs which shall be provided by
the developer's engineer of record, for completion of the required
infrastructure improvements, based upon the prevailing wage rate then
currently in effect for the city, such bond to be executed by the developer
as principal, with a corporate surety authorized to transact business in the
State of Illinois and acceptable to the Director of Engineering; or



      (2)   An escrow agreement with the Director of Engineering and
an escrow agent for the deposit of an amount equal to or exceeding 125% of
the estimated construction costs for completion of the required
infrastructure improvements, based upon the prevailing wage rate then
currently in effect for the city to assure adequate funds for the completion
of the required infrastructure improvements. The estimate of construction
cost shall be provided by the developer's engineer of record. The escrow
agreement shall be in a form adopted by the Director of Engineering and
executed by the developer, the Director of Engineering and a bank or savings
and loan association authorized to transact business in the State of Illinois
and acceptable by the Director of Engineering, as escrow agent. Upon
completion of improvements and approval by the Director of Engineering, the
city will allow draw down by the developer of escrow funds for completed work.



      (3)   An irrevocable standby letter of credit, in a form
acceptable to the Director of Engineering, with the city named as drawor.



      (4)   The term of any bond or escrow shall not exceed two
years and the applicant shall remain liable for actual completion of such
improvements whether or not a bond or escrow deposit is adequate to assure
completion of such improvements.



   (C)   Letter of credit or escrow agreement. Security is required to
assure compliance with § 161.13(B)(7). Therefore, if Portland Concrete
Cement is the surface material for a subdivision street, a letter of credit
or escrow agreement of 25% of the construction cost shall be required for a
minimum of two years from the date of final plat approval. The letter of
credit or escrow agreement must be in a form acceptable to the Director of
Engineering. The estimate of construction cost shall be provided by the
developer's engineer of record.



   (D)   Annexation covenant. Prior to the sale of any lots in a
subdivision in which any infrastructure improvements serving such lot or lots
will be dedicated to the city, or which are designed for the purpose of
eventual connection to dedicated infrastructure improvements of the city, the
developer or owner of record shall record a duly executed annexation covenant
in a form approved by the Director of Utilities, the Director of Engineering
and the Director of Planning and Development, which provides that the
developer or owner of record shall petition, at his, her or their own
expense, for annexation of such lot or lots to the City of Quincy and to the
Quincy Park District at any time in the future as he, she or they may be
requested to do so by the city and the Park District.

(Ord. 9278, passed 6-22-2015)



§ 161.22  TOLERANCE IN THICKNESS FOR ACCEPTANCE OF PAVEMENT.



   (A)   Pavement thickness determination for acceptance shall be based
on two-inch diameter cores. Three cores shall be taken from the pavement at
generated random locations within each unit. A unit shall consist of 1,000
square yards of pavement surface or fraction of, dependent on the length of
the roadway per lane. A unit length shall be considered as the entire length
of a driving lane from the edge of payment to edge of pavement of any
intersecting roadways or from the edge of pavement of any intersecting
roadway to the end of an improvement. The width of each unit shall be the
lane width of the roadway as shown on the typical section for that specific
roadway. For fractional units, the number of cores will be adjusted to one
core per 333 square yards or less. Improved shoulders and improved lanes
shall be considered as fractional units.



   (B)   The owner and the Director of Engineering or his assignee
shall witness the coring operations, as well as the measuring and recording
of the cores. Core measurements will be determined immediately upon removal
from the core bit and prior to moving to the next core location. Upon
concurrence of the length, the core samples may be disposed of. Upon
completion of coring, all core holes shall be filled with a rapid hardening
mortar or concrete.



   (C)   In considering any portion of the pavement that is deficient,
the limits of the unit or fraction of a unit to be used in computing the
deficiency will be determined by the Director of Engineering, except that no
portion of the pavement once included in such computation will be included in
a second computation. The average thickness of the pavement in each unit will
be determined by obtaining a weighted average of the cores, considering that
each core represents the thickness of the pavement extending longitudinally
in both directions halfway to the nearest core, or to the end of the unit.
Measurements which exceed the plan thickness shall be considered as the
specified thickness. When the average thickness of a unit is equal to or more
than 92.5% of the specified plan thickness, no deficiency payment will be
required. When the average thickness of a unit is less than 92.5% but equal
to or more than 80% of the specified plan thickness, a deficiency payment
shall be made by the owner to the road authority assuming maintenance of the
roads within the development. The deficiency payment shall be a percentage of
the total cost of the road surface material (PCC pavement or HMA surface and
binder) for that unit as determined by the owner's engineer's estimate of
cost used for the security for the improvement.

request of the owner. The weighted average for the unit will then be
recalculated for the determination of the deficiency payment. Area
adjustments will be made so that no one core represents more than one-third
of a unit area or less than one-sixth of a unit area when additional cores
are taken.

the Director of Planning and Development may designate. The map shall be
maintained as part of the geographic imaging system of the city and copies
shall be made available to the public upon payment of a fee in the amount
which shall offset the costs of copying and publishing the official map. The
map as maintained hereunder shall be the final authority as to the current

or alley, adjacent districts shall extend to the centerline of the vacation.



   (D)   Changes.  If, by amendment to these provisions, any change
made in any district boundary or in any other matter shown on the district

other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation. Where the
conditions imposed by any provisions herein upon the use of land or buildings
or upon the bulk of buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive
than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision herein or any other
law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations
which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements
shall govern. The title and interpretation provisions of Chapter 10,
generally applicable to this code, are specifically made applicable to this
chapter as if fully set forth herein.



      (c)   Effect on existing agreements.  These provisions are
not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private
agreement provided that where the regulations hereof are more restrictive or
impose higher standards or requirements than the easement, covenants or other
private agreements, the requirements herein shall govern.



   (B)   Use and bulk regulations.  No building, structure or land
shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or part thereof, or
other structure shall be erected, raised, moved, reconstructed, extended,

which it is located, as long as the building is in existence. Furthermore, no
legally required yards, courts or other open space or minimum lot area
allocated to any building shall, by virtue of change of ownership or for any
other reason, be used to satisfy yard, court, other open space or minimum lot
area requirements for any other building. Yards, parking space or lot area

§ 162.025  C3 DISTRICT (PLANNED COMMERCIAL DISTRICT).



   In the C3 District, there may be any of the uses set forth in the above
sections, subject to the following.



   (A)   Generally.  A C3 District shall be laid out and developed as
a unit according to a plan approved by the Council for the purpose of
providing modern shopping facilities of integrated design in appropriate
locations to serve residential neighborhoods. The uses allowed shall be
limited to those contemplated by the original plan or any amendment thereof.



   (B)   Plan and procedures.  Before the district is established, the
person or persons desiring to use and develop the land shall submit a plan to
the Commission showing in detail the manner in which the land is to be used,
the location, character and appearance of buildings, parking areas, service
areas, walks, lighting and appurtenant facilities the provisions for grass,
trees, shrubs and other landscaping adjacent to the surrounding property and
all other material information. If the Commission reports to the Council that
the plan complies with all regulations of this chapter, is in the best
interests of the city, will not adversely affect adjacent property values and
is consistent with the public interest and purposes of this section, then the
Council may approve the district and plan, and building and occupancy permits
may be issued to carry out the approved plan.



   (C)   Conditions and guarantees.  Prior to approving any plan, the
Plan Commission may recommend, and the City Council may stipulate, conditions
and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance
and operation of the use or uses as deemed necessary for the protection of
the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and
requirements as specified herein, or as may be from time to time required. In
all cases in which a C3 District is approved, the City Council shall require
evidence and guarantee as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be complied with. All
conditions and guarantees must be fully complied with prior to the use or
uses commenced. If conditions, guarantees or specific conditions are not
complied with, the use shall be immediately terminated. The City Council may
also revoke any use for a failure to comply. In that event the zoning shall
revert to its former zoning.



   (D)   Special condition.  All plans approved hereunder shall be
subject to the specific condition that if actual construction of buildings is
not begun and thereafter actively pursued within two years of the date of
approval by the City Council, the district shall automatically revert to the
same zoning classification existing prior to the approval, provided that the
City Council may extend the time periods as it shall deem appropriate. Actual
construction of buildings shall require, at a minimum, actual work on the
components of the building and not mere land preparation and architectural
planning.



   (E)   Amendment.  Plans may be amended by the same procedure by
which they are originally approved. Any material change in the plan or use
must be approved. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a strictly
temporary use or activity otherwise permitted in a C2 District shall not
require a plan amendment although not contemplated or set forth in the plan.

appropriate under approved site plans and conditions. The approved plans and
conditions shall be consistent with good planning practice and compatible
with permitted developments and uses in adjoining districts, so as to protect
the general welfare subject to the following exceptions and special
provisions.



   (B)   Generally.  A M3 District shall be laid out and developed as

submit a plan to the Commission showing in detail the manner in which the
land is to be used, the location, character and appearance of buildings,
parking areas, service areas, walks, lighting and other landscaping adjacent
to the surrounding property and all other material information. If the
Commission reports to the Council that the plan complies with all regulations
of this chapter, is in the best interests of the city, will not adversely
affect adjacent property values and is consistent with the public interest
and purposes of this chapter, then the Council may approve the district and

and requirements as specified herein, or as may be from time to time
required. In all cases in which a M3 District is approved, the City Council
shall require evidence and guarantee as it may deem necessary as proof that
the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be
complied with. All conditions and guarantees must be fully complied with
prior to the use or uses being commenced. If the conditions, guarantees or
specific condition are not complied with, the use shall be immediately
terminated. The City Council may also revoke any use for a failure to comply.

subject to the specific condition that if actual construction of buildings is
not begun and thereafter actively pursued within two years of the date of
approval by the City Council, the plans shall no longer be considered
approved, provided that the City Council may extend the time periods as it
shall deem appropriate. Actual construction of buildings shall require, at

and residentially zoned areas; and building used by the United States, the
state or any unit of local government; any parks or play grounds; or any
business which sells or dispenses in some manner alcoholic beverages. This
restriction may, however, be waived by the City Council if:
 

C2, C3, C4, M1



 
 
      (1)   The proposed use will not be contrary to the public
interest or injurious to nearby properties; and the spirit and intent of this
provision observed;
 
 


 
 
      (2)   The proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the
development of a “skid-row” or similar deteriorated area;
 
 


 
 
      (3)   The establishment of an additional use of this type in
the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation or
improvement, either residential or nonresidential;
 
 


 
 
      (4)   The other applicable regulations of this chapter are
observed; and
 
 


 
 
      (5)   The owner of owners (as opposed to the occupants) of a
majority of the property or properties within which the use may not be
located (e.g. residentially zoned areas) consent in writing to the proposed
use. For the purposes of these restrictions, measurements shall be made in a
straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the
property line of the adult use to the nearest property line of the other use.
 
 


 
 
For purposes of the consent requirement provided above, the following
specific rules shall apply.
 
 


 
 
      (1)   The requisite majority shall require the consent of the
owner or owners of the property or both the properties if there is one
property or there are two properties, and any number more than 50% of the
properties if there are more than two properties.
 
 


 
 
      (2)   The relative area of properties shall not be a
consideration, but only the actual number of individual properties.
 
 


 
 
      (3)   Each property considered shall be a zoning lot and not
divisions or parts thereof.
 
 


 
 
      (4)   Any property or properties owned or occupied by any
person, firm or corporation interested, or to be interested, directly or
indirectly, in the proposed adult use or the property at which it is to be
located shall not be considered. The interest may include among others, any
interest as stockholder, partner, investor, sole proprietor, agent, employee,
landlord or consultant.
 
 


 
 
      (5)   In determining whether multiple owners of property
consent to the use, the majority in interest (as opposed to a majority in
number) will be determinative.
 
 


 
 
      (6)   When title to real estate is conveyed after written
consent is given, the consent shall remain valid unless withdrawn by a
majority of the then owners.
 
 


 
 
      (7)   A consent may be withdrawn before a permit is approved
by the City Council, but the applicant has a right to substitute new consents
for those lost through withdrawal.
 
 


 
 
      (8)   The consent requirement shall not be construed to vest
the power to issue permits in landowners. The City Council retains the power
to deny a permit event if the required consents are filed. Instead, the
consent requirement is imposed because adult uses are considered as so
potentially disturbing to the neighboring uses specified that additional
limitations are warranted.
 
 


 
 
   (b)   The adult use specifically permitted shall be limited to a
single primary adult use, although the special permit may allow for other
secondary adult uses. The primary adult use shall be one of those within the

   (d)   Any sign shall be approved by the City Council, shall contain
only the actual name of the business, and shall not overhang any public
street or sidewalk.
 
 


 
 
   (e)   No building in which the use is located shall be painted in
garish colors or in any other fashion as will effectuate the same purpose as
a sign or advertisement.
 
 


 
 
   (f)   Lobby and entrance areas must be designed so as to minimize
obstruction of sidewalks during operating hours
 
 


 
 
   (g)   No loudspeakers or sound equipment shall be used in connection
with the use that can be discerned by the public from pedestrian sidewalks or
walkways, or from other areas, which are public or semi-public.
 
 


 
 
   (h)   In the event the adult use also involves a use which is
licensed, such as the sale of alcoholic beverages, massage establishments or
theaters, the use shall at all times be properly licensed.
 
 


 
 
   (i)   No unlawful activities may be conducted on the premises.
 
 


 
 
   (j)   This provision shall not be construed to allow violation of
any applicable laws, including but not limited to those pertaining to
obscenity, indecent conduct (§ 132.04), or the sale of alcoholic beverages
(Chapter 111).
 
 


Editor’s note:

   Ordinance 8041 provided the following transition provision. 
Transition: The provisions of this ordinance as they pertain to special
permits for adult uses shall not apply to any adult use lawfully in existence
at the time this ordinance takes effect, provided that the adult use
continues to be conducted at the same location and in the same manner it was
on the effective date of this ordinance, the ownership of the business or
stock in the business conducting the use is not changed at any time
thereafter to the cumulative extent of 50% or more, and the adult use is
registered with the Secretary of the Plan Commission within 90 days after the
effective date of this ordinance. No charge shall be made for the
registration. The form of registration shall be as prescribed by the
Secretary of the Plan Commission but shall set forth, at a minimum, the
location, nature and ownership of the adult use. Upon being duly registered,
a special permit for the use shall be issued. Except as otherwise provided in
this division, the special permit shall thereafter be subject to the
provisions generally applicable to special permits, provided, however,
without further approval, the use can be made to more conform with the
requirements governing adult uses. In the event the location, nature or
ownership of the adult use is changed as provided above, or the adult use is
not registered, the right to continue the use shall automatically terminate.
If and when requested by the Secretary of the Plan Commission, the last known
owner or owners of the use shall file an affidavit with the Secretary of the
Plan Commission setting forth any changes relative to the use (e.g.
ownership). If not provided within 30 days after a request therefore is made,
the right to continue the use shall terminate and the special permit
considered withdrawn. In the event of an extension of jurisdiction of the
city’s zoning authority, the same rules shall apply as to the use, but from
the date the jurisdiction is effectively extended. Once the right to continue
an adult use hereunder terminates, a special permit under the terms of
division (b), as amended by this ordinance, shall be required. In the event
an adult use also sells alcoholic beverages, the other use must be separately
registered if a special permit would be required in the district involved.
The other registration shall not be deemed to allow the continuance of the
adult use beyond the period allowed by this section. Instead, each respective
use shall be governed by their separate transition provisions.


Sale of alcoholic beverages
 
   (a)   The sale of alcoholic beverages may not be located within 500
feet of any pre-existing district use for the sale of alcoholic beverages;
and not-for-profit school, community college, college or other similar
educational institution; any church or other place of worship, any
residentially zoned areas; any building used by the United States, the state
or any unit of local government; or any parks or playgrounds. This
restriction may, however, be waived by the City Council if:
 
NR2 and C1B and other district in which the sale of alcoholic beverages is
incidental and secondary to a primary use, including but not limited to
colleges, country clubs and golf courses except by special permit, the sale
of alcoholic beverages shall not be allowed as a primary use in districts of
a higher classification than C1B such as C1A and all residential districts


 
 
      (1)   The proposed use will not be contrary the public
interest or injurious to nearby properties and the spirit and intent of this
provision observed;
 
 


 
 
      (2)   The proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the
development of “skid-row” or similar deteriorated area;
 
 


 
 
      (3)   The establishment of an additional use of this type in
the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation
permit or improvement, either residential or nonresidential; and
 
 


 
 
      (4)   The other applicable alcoholic regulations of Chapter
111 are observed.
 
 


 
 
   (b)   The business must be properly licensed.
 
 


 
 
   (c)   No illegal activities may be conducted on the premises.
 
 


 
 
   (d)   This provision shall not be construed to allow violation of
any applicable laws including, but not limited to those pertaining to the
sale of alcoholic beverages. The issuance of a special permit shall further
not be construed to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages without the
requisite license such as that required by Title XI of the municipal code or
other applicable laws or ordinances.
 
 


Editor’s note:

   Ordinance 8041 provided the following transition provisions. 
Transition: The provisions of this ordinance as they pertain to special
permits for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall not apply to any business
lawfully licensed and actually selling alcoholic beverages at the time this
ordinance takes effect, provided that the use continues to be conducted at
the same location and in the same manner it was on the effective date of this
ordinance, and the use is registered with the Secretary of the Plan
Commission within 90 days after the effective date of this ordinance. No
charge shall be made for the registration. The form of registration shall be
as prescribed by the Secretary of the Plan Commission but shall set forth, at
a minimum, the location and nature of the use. Upon being duly registered, a
special permit for the use shall be issued. Except as otherwise provided in
this division, the special permit shall thereafter be subject to the
provisions generally applicable to special permits, provided, however,
without further approval, the use can be made to more conform with the
requirements governing the sale of alcoholic beverages. In the event the
location or manner of the use is changed as provided above, or the use is not
registered, the right to continue the use shall automatically terminate. In
the event of an extension of jurisdiction of the city’s zoning authority,
the same rules shall apply as to the use, but from the date the jurisdiction
is effectively extended. Once the right to continue the sale of alcoholic
beverage hereunder terminates, a special permit under the terms of division
(a) above, as amended by this ordinance, shall be required. The conduct of a
business for the sale of alcoholic beverages is expressly permitted
notwithstanding the sale or transfer of the business. To better give effect
to this division, the Secretary of the Plan Commission may notify in writing
all holders of a liquor license under Title XI of the municipal code of the
registration requirements of this ordinance.

as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and
will be complied with. All conditions, guarantees and the applicable specific
conditions set forth in division (B) above, must be fully complied with prior

conditions are not complied with, the use shall be immediately terminated.
The City Council may also revoke any special permit for a failure to comply.



   (E)   Limitation of special permit.  It is the responsibility of
all applicants for special permits to submit complete and thorough plans
relative to any specially permitted use. This is particularly important
relative to the exterior of any building. Any use, activity or items not
clearly incidental to or implied from the specially permitted use shall not
be allowed. What is clearly incidental to or implied shall be strictly
construed. Use, activity or items shall include, but not be limited to,
lighting, signs and parking arrangements.



   (F)   Procedures.



      (1)   Application.  The form of application for a special
permit shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Plan Commission, but shall
include requirements as may be imposed by the Plan Commission or the City
Council, if any. All applications for special permits shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Plan Commission. The application shall be accompanied by
eight copies of a detailed plot plan of the lot and proposed use, drawn to an
accurate scale by a person competent therein, showing all pertinent
information. It is the responsibility of all applicants for special permits
to submit complete and thorough plans relative to any specially permitted
use. This is particularly important relative to the exterior of any building
or structure. Any use, activity or items not clearly incidental to or implied
from the specially permitted use shall not be allowed. What is clearly
incidental to or implied shall be strictly construed. Use, activity or items
shall include, but shall not be limited to, landscaping, lighting and parking
arrangements. The Secretary of the Plan Commission may also require
submission of a proposed form of special permit.



      (2)   Review by Plan Commission.  The Plan Commission shall
conduct a public hearing on the application to be held within 60 days from
the date of the receipt of the application by the Secretary of the Plan
Commission. After the hearing on the application, the Plan Commission shall
file a report with the City Council. The Plan Commission shall have 60 days
following the filing of the application to hold a hearing and submit its
report. If a report is not filed with the City Council within 60 days, it may
be assumed by the City Council that the Plan Commission approved the
application, providing a hearing has been held. In its review, the Plan
Commission shall consider the standards and conditions set forth in this
division as well as any other pertinent matters.



      (3)   Notice of hearing.  The Plan Commission shall cause to
be published public notice of the hearing on each proposed special permit at
least once, not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days before the hearing,
in a newspaper published within the city. The notice shall contain the date
and location for which the public hearing, the subject property for which the
special permit is requested, a brief statement of the use for which the
special permit is being requested and shall state that every person in
attendance at the hearing shall have an opportunity to be heard, that every
interested party (as defined under § 162.001) shall have the right to
cross-examine others at the hearing, provided that the interested party
enters his or her appearance with the Department of Planning and Development
no later than three business days before the date of the public hearing. In
addition to providing public notice by publication, the Department shall post
a sign at the subject property advising the public of the requested action;
the sign shall be posted not less 15 days prior to the public hearing.



      (4)   Notice to property owners.  The applicant shall not
less than 15 days before the date of the public hearing, serve written
notice, either in person or by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, on at least one owner of each property within 250 feet in each
direction of the lot line of the subject property unless waived by the Plan
Commission or City Council. Ownership shall be based solely on the tax
records of the county. The number of feet occupied by all public roads,
streets, alleys or other public ways shall be excluded in computing the 250
feet requirement; provided further that in no event shall this requirement
exceed 400 feet, including public streets, alleys and other public ways. The
notice shall contain the same information as is required under division
(F)(3) above for the public hearing notice. If, after a bona fide effort to
determine the address by the applicant, the owner of the property on which
notice is served cannot be found at his, her or its last know address, or the
mailed notice is returned because the owner cannot be found at the last known
address, the notice requirements of these provisions shall be deemed
satisfied. Proof of giving notice hereof by affidavit shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Plan Commission. A failure to comply with the provisions of
this division shall not affect or invalidate the issuance of a special permit
and additionally may be waived by the City Council or Plan Commission.



      (5)   Issuance.  After receiving the recommendations and
report of the Plan Commission, the City Council may grant the proposed
special permit, with or without change, may eject it, may recommit it to the
Plan Commission for further consideration or take other appropriate action.
The special permit shall be issued by the Secretary of the Plan Commission if
and as a proved by the City Council. The special permit shall be subject to
terms and conditions as required by the City Council and otherwise by this
chapter. The terms and conditions may exceed those otherwise contemplated
herein if deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to
secure compliance will the standards and requirements specified herein or as
may be from time to time required.



      (6)   Continuation of bearing.  After notice of a scheduled
hearing has been published, or served on adjoining property owners, as
provided herein, the hearing may be continued or withdrawn only upon approval
of the Plan Commission. A request by an applicant for continuation or
withdrawal may only be granted for good cause. Any request must be made in
person to the Plan Commission or in writing setting forth the reasons for the
request. Notwithstanding any request, the Plan Commission shall have the
discretion to: grant the request; deny the request and hold any required
public hearing and make a recommendation to the City Council regarding the
subject application; or grant a continuance and defer taking any final
action, but proceed with any required public hearing. In addition, and
notwithstanding the foregoing, if an applicant (who has otherwise failed to
previously request a continuation or withdrawal of an application) fails to
appear at the scheduled hearing, the application may be denied by the Plan
Commission with or without any required public hearing and the denial
reported to the City Council.



      (7)   Fees.  Except in those cases where a special permit is
requested by the city, a fee of $300 shall be paid to the city to defray the
cost of the administration, publishing, posting notices of the proposed
amendment and the cost of maintaining a record of the public hearing. The fee
shall be paid to the Department of Planning and Development.



   (G)   Multiple special permits.  In the event two or more uses or
activities are conducted on premises requiring special permits, a separate
special permit shall be required for each the use or activity.



   (H)   Change in or additions to use.  An amendment to a special
permit shall be sought in the event there is proposed any material change in
or addition to a specially permitted use or any matters related to the same.
An amendment to a special permit shall be sought in the same manner as an
original special permit. Without in any way limiting the requirement of
obtaining an amendment to a special permit, a material change or addition in
a specially permitted use shall be deemed to occur if there is or will be a
change in or addition to a use, activity or items not clearly incidental to
or implied from the specially permitted use. What is clearly incidental to or
implied from shall be strictly construed. Use, activity or items shall
include, but not be limited to lighting, signs, parking arrangements, size of
any structure, change in access, an increase or amplification of the
intensity of the use, and an increase in that portion of a tract occupied by
the use.



   (I)   Permits run with land.  All special permits run with the land
unless they shall otherwise provide. The right to conduct the specially
permitted use is, accordingly, incident to the ownership of the premises to
which it pertains. A specially permitted use may be rebuilt if damaged or
destroyed. However, in all events, the use shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this subchapter and the special permit.



   (J)   Effect of denial of special permit.  After a public hearing
has been held and a special permit denied in whole or part by the City
Council, an application for the same special permit or a permit which is
substantially or materially the same as the denied permit shall not be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the denial, unless
allowed by the City Council. In general, resubmission shall be allowed only
if there is substantial new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to
warrant resubmission.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING



§ 162.090  PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose and intent of this subchapter that off-street parking
and loading areas be provided and adequately maintained in every zoning
district for the purposes of promoting safe and efficient parking of motor
vehicles; to avoid unnecessary congestion and interference with public use of
streets; and to protect and preserve the appearance, character and value of
the surrounding neighborhoods.



(1980 Code, § 29.601)



§ 162.091  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   In all zoning districts, off-street parking and loading
requirements shall be provided in amounts not less than specified for the
various districts.



   (B)   (1)   The Director of Planning and Development, after
consultation with the Director of Utilities and Engineering, shall make a
determination, in the cases of uses not listed in § 162.091 of the minimum
required off-street parking spaces.



      (2)   In reaching the determination, the Director of Planning
and Development and the Director of Utilities and Engineering, shall be
guided by the requirements for similar uses, the number and kind of vehicles
likely to be attracted to the proposed use and studies of the parking
requirements of the uses in other jurisdictions.



      (3)   The Director of Planning and Development may approve
alternative parking standards in situations where an applicant can
sufficiently demonstrate that a particular situation is unusual, unique or
poses practical difficulty, and upon submission of adequate technical
justification such as independent parking analysis, Urban Land Institute
(ULI) or Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) parking standards or
similar justification.



   (C)   Additional parking shall be provided and maintained in proper
ratio to any increase in floor area or building use capacity.



   (D)   For the purposes of determining off-street parking and loading
requirements, the following provisions shall apply.



      (1)   USABLE FLOOR AREA as applied to offices, merchandising
or service types of uses, shall mean the floor area used or intended to be
used for services to the public as customers, patrons, clients, patients or
tenants, including areas occupied by fixtures and equipment used for display
or sale of merchandise, but excluding floor areas which are used exclusively
for storage, for housing of mechanical equipment integral to the building,
for maintenance facilities, stairwells, restrooms or for those areas so
restricted that customers, patients, clients, salespersons and the general
public are denied access. Measurement of useable floor area shall be the sum
of the horizontal area of each story of a structure measured from the
interior faces of the exterior walls.



      (2)   Where benches, pews or other similar seating facilities
are used as seats, each 24 inches of the seating facilities shall be counted
as one seat.



   (E)   In the case of mixed uses in the same building at the same
time, the total requirements for off-street parking and loading shall be the
sum of the requirements for the separate individual uses computed separately.



   (F)   Joint or collective provision of off-street parking for
buildings or uses on two or more properties shall not be less than the sum of
the requirements for the participating individual uses computed separately.



   (G)   It shall be unlawful to use any of the off-street parking or
loading areas established to meet the requirements of this subchapter for any
purpose other than the parking of licensed vehicles or the loading and
unloading of necessary service trucks.



   (H)   Off-street parking shall be no closer to any principal
building than five feet. Bumper guards shall be installed to prevent yard
encroachment.



   (I)   In the residential districts and in commercial and industrial
districts within 50 feet of an residential district, no parking space may be
located in a front yard.



   (J)   Parking spaces may be provided in side and rear yards in the
residential districts and in any yard in commercial and industrial districts
except that in the commercial and industrial districts, no parking space may
be provided in a front yard unless the building is set back at least 30 feet
from the street, and further provided that the parking use must conform to
the permitted land use for the district.



   (K)   Parking spaces for any use specifically permitted in an
residential district may be provided on a lot adjoining that use provided
there is compliance with all the requirements of divisions (I) and (J) above.



   (L)   Where parking is provided in a commercial district adjacent to
a residential district or where five or more parking spaces are provided for
use in a residential district adjacent to a residential district, all parking
spaces, loading spaces and drives shall be set back from the residential
district 15 feet. This setback shall be a landscaped area providing sight
proof landscaping and/or fencing to screen the use from adjacent properties
as approved on a site plan per requirements in §§ 162.280 through 162.285.



   (M)   Where parking is provided in a manufacturing district adjacent
to a residential district, all parking spaces, loading spaces and internal
drives except for fire lanes, ingress and egress, shall be set back from the
residential district 30 feet. This setback shall be a landscaped area
providing sight proof landscaping and/or fencing to screen the use from
adjacent properties as approved on a site plan per requirements in §§
162.280 through 162.285.



   (N)   When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces
or loading spaces required by this subchapter results in a requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one
parking space; any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded.



   (O)   No repairs or services to vehicles shall be carried on or
permitted in off-street parking areas.



   (P)   No vehicular display for purpose of sale shall be carried on
or permitted upon the premises unless the display is by a licensed automobile
dealer on a properly zoned parcel.



   (Q)   In the residential districts, the only off-street parking
permitted is that parking which is an accessory use to the primary
residential dwelling. The use of an off-street parking lot in a residential
district by a nearby or adjacent to a commercial use is prohibited.



   (R)   Off-street parking required for enlargements or change of use.
Existing buildings not complying with off-street parking requirements may be
remodeled, repaired and structurally altered, but any enlargement or change
of use of a structure or building which would require a greater number of
parking spaces than was required for the prior use must provide the required
parking spaces for the enlargement or use.

§ 162.093  CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A) Purpose.  It is the purpose and intent of this section to apply
flexible off-street parking and loading requirements for the Central Business
District (CBD). The goal is to accommodate the special needs of the area,
encourage and promote redevelopment, optimize existing parking facilities,
promote shared parking and public transportation and prevent existing
historic structures from being demolished for new parking areas. The parking
regulations are reduced in the CBD to aid in the renewal and rebuilding of
the downtown.



   (B)   General provisions.



      (1)   For purposes of this section, the Central Business
District (CBD) shall be defined as areas with downtown district zoning (D1,
D2, D3, D4 and D5).



      (2)   No off-street parking spaces shall be permitted in front
of a structure.



      (3)   In all downtown zoning districts, the off-street parking
requirements may be reduced to 50% of the parking spaces otherwise required;
provided the subject property or lot is located within 600 feet of a
municipal parking lot which is primarily available for public parking (as
distinguished from a municipal parking lot reserved for employee or other
reserved parking).



      (4)   The reciprocal (shared) use of parking facilities
provided to serve any property or use is encouraged in the downtown
districts. The applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict in
the principal operating hours of the buildings or uses for which the
reciprocal use of parking is proposed. A reciprocal parking agreement shall
be approved by the Department of Planning and Development and recorded with
the County Recorder’s office.



      (5)   All shared parking facilities shall be located within
600 feet (horizontal distance) of the use served.



      (6)   Shared parking proposals involving existing municipal
parking lots shall be reviewed during the site plan review process.



      (7)   The street frontage of all parking areas shall be
screened from the public right-of-way with adequate landscaping and/or iron,
brick or natural stone fencing between 36 and 42 inches in height as approved
by the Department of Planning and Development on the site development plan.
New landscaping installations must achieve the screening height within two
years. The use of parking lot landscaping at the perimeter, and on landscape
islands is strongly encouraged and shall be shown on a landscaping plan to be
submitted with the site plan for review by the Department of Planning and
Development.



      (8)   Existing buildings not in compliance with the off street
parking requirements of this section may be remodeled, repaired, and
structurally altered and may change use without complying with the minimum

a nightclub or cabaret are required to comply with § 162.092 Off Street
Parking Requirements.



      (9)   Parking requirements in all downtown districts will not
be enforced on new construction provided the new building has the same
footprint of the previous structure. To qualify for this exemption, new
construction shall be initiated within two years after a building is
demolished. This information needs to be shown on the site plan for review by
the Department of Planning and Development.



      (10)   Where parking is provided in a downtown district
adjacent to an residential district, all parking spaces, loading spaces and
drives shall be setback from the residential district ten feet. This setback
shall provide sight proof landscaping and/or fencing to screen the use from
adjacent properties as approved on a site plan per requirements in §§
162.280 through 162.285.

properties shall be provided wherever feasible as determined by the Director
of Planning and Development or his or her authorized designee; and



      (e)   All parking stalls shall have a minimum dimension of
nine feet wide by 18 feet long. This rectangular area must be included in all
shapes of parking stalls for any angle of parking. An automobile overhang may
be included in stall depth calculations where the overhang does not extend
beyond a required parking setback line or encroach upon a sidewalk. When an
automobile overhang beyond an installed curb is included in the stall depth
calculation, the overhang shall be considered as part of the parking stall
for landscaping or setback purposes.



   (H)   Access.  Except on lots accommodating single-family
dwellings, each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or
driveway at least 12 feet wide for one-way travel or 24 feet wide for two-way
travel. However, a ten foot wide aisle for one-way travel is permitted
provided that there are no points of vehicular or pedestrian access to any
building from the driving aisle. The minimum width of an access drive
intersecting a street or alley is 24 feet for two-way travel or 12 feet for
one-way travel. The minimum return radius from an access drive to a street or
alley shall be 20 feet as measured from the back of the curb wherever
possible.



   (I)   Maintenance.  Upon completion, all parking areas shall be
properly maintained at all times, without pot holes, broken curbing or other
irregularities.

§ 162.098  LANDSCAPING.



   (A)   Purpose.  It is the purpose and intent of these regulations
to provide adequate protection for contiguous property against undesirable
effects caused by the creation and operation of parking and loading areas,
and to protect and preserve the appearance and character of the surrounding
neighborhoods through the screening effects and aesthetic qualities of
landscaping. All parking and loading areas constructed after the date of this
subchapter shall be properly screened and landscaped as hereinafter described.



   (B)   Definition.  For purposes of this section, LANDSCAPING shall
mean living green plants in combination of trees and either shrubs or ground
cover, all of which are defined as follows:



      (1)   Deciduous trees having, at the time of planting, not
less than a two and one-half inch caliper measured on the trunk six inches
above the ground;



      (2)   Ornamental trees having, at the time of planting, not
less than one and one-half inch caliper measured on the trunk six inches
above the ground;

height of not less than four feet;



      (4)   Shrubs having, at the time of planting, a height of not
less that two feet; and



      (5)   Ground cover which includes grass, ivy, juniper, wood
mulch, decorative or aggregate rock or other approved pervious surfaces.



   (C)   Quality.  Plant material and grasses shall be of generally
acceptable varieties and species, free of insects and diseases, and hardy to
the city area as listed in the Arboricultural Specifications Manual for the
City of Quincy.



   (D)   Landscaping plan.  An applicant for development approval who
is required to install landscaping shall submit a landscaping plan along with
the application for development approval to the Department of Planning and
Development. The landscaping plan shall be prepared by a landscape architect
or designer. The required landscaping information can also be included on the
site plan. The landscaping plan shall include all of the following:



      (1)   Landscaper’s name, address and telephone number; name
of development;



      (2)   Location, quantity, size and type of existing on-site
natural vegetation to be utilized, if any;



      (3)   Location, quantity, size and type of proposed
landscaping on a site plan, showing its relation to other site features such
as utilities and easements;



      (4)   Elevation and drawings of any solid screen proposed;

      (11)   Any other information that may be needed to show
compliance with this section.



   (E)   Landscaping requirements adjacent to streets.  Where a
parking lot lies adjacent to or is visible from any public or private street,
the entire frontage along the parking area, excluding curb cuts or other
accessways, shall be landscaped and screened as follows. See Figure 5.



      (1)   One tree and four shrubs shall be planted for every 30
feet of frontage to be located within a strip of land paralleling the
adjacent street and having a width of not less than five feet. Trees do not
have to be placed 30 feet on center. Strategic grouping of shrubs is
encouraged.



      (2)   The landscaping strip of land paralleling the adjacent
street shall be located on private property. This strip shall not contain any
impervious surface and shall be planted in 80% grass (seeded or sodded) in
addition to the required landscaping.



      (3)   A maximum of 50% of the required number of trees may
consist of a mix of ornamental and evergreen trees.



      (4)   The required number of trees and shrubs may be reduced
by up to 50% if earth sculpting, berms or decorative screening fences or
walls are installed on private property along the frontage of the adjacent
street to a height of not less than three feet above the grade of the parking
area and, in the opinion of the Director of Planning and Development, are
designed to effectively screen the parking area yet avoid erosion, drainage
or maintenance problems



      (5)   No landscaping, hedge, wall, fence or berm that exceeds
24 inches in height shall be located within ten feet of any driveway opening
nor otherwise located so as to interfere with the visibility of vehicles or
pedestrians.



   (F)   Landscaping requirements for interior areas.  Where a parking
lot having 50 or more parking spaces is wholly or partially visible from an
adjacent public or private street, it shall be further landscaped as follows.
Any fractional result shall be increased to the next whole number.



      (1)   Quantities.



 

Canopy trees
 

1 per 15 spaces



Understory trees
 

1 per 10 spaces



Shrubs
 

1 per 4 spaces




 



      (2)   Distribution.  The required landscaping shall be
generally distributed throughout the parking area provided that a minimum of
25% of the required total for each plant category (large canopy trees,
understory trees and shrubs) shall be planted on interior features such as
islands, peninsulas or medians. Each parking space shall be located within
100 feet of a canopy tree or understory tree located anywhere on the subject
property. For the purpose of this section only, this may include either an
existing tree, a tree required by this section, a tree installed as buffer
tree, or a tree installed as a street tree. The remaining 75% of the required
total plantings may be distributed between interior features; areas within 30
feet of the outside boundary of the parking and/or driveway surface; areas
between a parking surface and any principal building on the site; or in
planters on any ground generally enclosed by a combination of building area,
pedestrian facilities and/or parking surface.



      (3)   Interior landscaped areas shall follow the minimum
dimension requirements illustrated in Figures 2 through 4.



      (4)   A maximum of 50% of the required number of trees may
consist of a mix of ornamental and evergreen trees.



      (5)   The landscaping shall be in addition to any planting or
landscaping within six feet of a building or other screening requirements.



   (G)   Existing trees.  Existing canopy and/or understory trees
located within 30 feet of the parking or driveway surface may be counted
toward the requirements of this section provided that they are located on the
subject property. Existing trees located in the public right-of-way do not
qualify. All distances are to be measured from the nearest face of the tree
trunk. Existing canopy trees with a caliper of at least ten inches, measured
at 12 inches above the root crown may count as two trees. The use of existing
trees shall be noted on the landscape plan.



   (H)   Maintenance of landscaping and screening.  All landscaping
and screenings shall be installed and permanently maintained as follows:



      (1)   All new landscaped areas shall be installed within six
months after the occupancy or use of the building or premises. Dead plant
materials shall be replaced within 12 months with living plant material,
taking into consideration the season of the year, and shall have at least the
same quantity and quality of landscaping as initially approved. This
includes, but is not limited to, the replacement of plants damaged by
insects, diseases, vehicular traffic, acts of God and vandalism;



      (2)   All landscaping and screening shall be maintained in a
healthy, neat, trimmed, clean and weed-free condition. Landscaped areas shall
be covered with either grass and/or other types of pervious ground cover
located beneath and surrounding the trees and shrubs; and



      (3)   Landscaped areas immediately adjacent to an off-street
parking or loading area shall be protected from the encroachment of motor
vehicles by placing, along the entire perimeter of the landscaped area, a
six-inch concrete barrier curb.



   (I)   Outdoor refuse collection.  Refuse areas shall not be located
within front yards or within required parking setbacks. Outdoor refuse
collection containers and similar facilities shall be screened from public
view on all four sides. The area shall be visually screened with an opaque
material, which may include shrubs, walls, fences or berms that are a minimum
of six feet in height. Single-family homes shall be exempt from this
provision.



 

It is necessary to accommodate the vehicle overhang when designing landscaped
areas in parking lots. Plants are often damaged if a landscape strip is not
wide enough to provide for both the plants and the vehicle overhang.

§ 162.099  OFF-STREET LOADING/UNLOADING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Purpose.  The following regulations, applicable to new
construction in all zoning districts except for single-family lots, are
established to increase safety and decrease congestion in the public streets,
to set standards for the requirement of off-street loading facilities in
proportion to the amount of traffic generated by each use and to eliminate
the on-street parking of vehicles along major traffic routes.



   (B)   Location.  All required loading berths shall be located on
the same zoning lot as the use served. No loading berth for vehicles over two
tons shall be closer than 50 feet to any property in a residential district.
No permitted or required loading berth shall be located within 25 feet of the
nearest point of intersection of any two streets. No loading berths shall be
located in required side yards.



   (C)   Design and maintenance.



      (1)   Size.  The number and size of loading spaces must be
equal to the maximum number and size of vehicles which would be
simultaneously loaded or unloaded in connection with the business conducted
on the property. Each required loading berth shall have a minimum width of 12
feet and a minimum vertical clearance of 14 feet above finished grade of the
space. The length shall be a minimum of 30 feet for local delivery and 60
feet for semi-trailers.



      (2)   Access.  Each required off-street loading berth shall
be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley
in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movements.



      (3)   Projection.  No portion of a vehicle shall project into
a street, drive, alley or other public right-of-way while being loaded or
unloaded.



      (4)   Exclusive use.  Spaces allocated to any off-street
loading shall not, while so allocated, be used to satisfy the space
requirements for any off-street parking facilities or portions thereof.



      (5)   Surfacing.  All open off-street loading finish surfaces
shall comply with the provisions of § 162.095.



      (6)   Repair and service.  No motor vehicle repair work or
service of any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with loading facilities
provided in any residence or business district.

§ 162.112  ACCESSORY BUILDING REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   An accessory building(s) shall not occupy more than 15% of a
rear yard area in the RE1, to R3, NR1, and NR2 Districts. At no time shall a
single accessory building exceed an area of 1,200 square feet. In the RU1
District accessory buildings shall have a maximum size of 2,500 square feet
on properties less than five acres in size, 3,600 square feet on properties
between five and ten acres, and 5,000 square feet in size for properties
greater than ten acres in size.



   (B)   Any accessory building closer than ten feet to a main building
shall be considered as part of the main building and shall be provided with
the side and rear yards required for the main building.



   (C)   If an accessory building is more than ten feet from the main
building on a lot, the accessory building may be built in a rear yard,
provided the accessory building shall not be located nearer than two feet to
any side or rear lot or nearer than five feet to any alley or similar
right-of-way easement abutting the rear or side of the lot. This shall not be
construed as requiring a side yard greater than would otherwise be required.
An accessory building located under this provision must be at least 60 feet
from the actual front street curb line or, if no curb, where the same would
be located as determined by the Director of Utilities and Engineering.



   (D)   Where a garage is entered from an alley, it must be kept ten
feet from the alley line or sixteen and one-half feet from the centerline of
the alley, whichever is more.



   (E)   On corner lots, the minimum buildable width of 28 feet (see §
162.062(B)) for main building is reduced to 22 feet for accessory buildings.



   (F)   No accessory building shall be constructed upon a lot until
the construction of the main building has been actually commenced, and no
accessory building shall be used for dwelling purposes; provided, however,
that the provisions of this division shall not apply during any period or
periods during which the City Council, by resolution, shall declare that a
housing emergency exist.



   (G)   Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky,
unobstructed, except for accessory buildings in a rear yard, and except for
the ordinary projections of skylights, sills, belt courses, cornices and
ornamental feature projecting not to exceed 12 inches.



   (H)   An open unenclosed porch or paved terrace may project into a
front yard for a distance not exceeding ten feet.



   (I)   (1)   Heating and air conditioning units shall not be
placed in the required front yard. Heating and air conditioning units may be
permitted in side yards, provided:



         (a)   A three foot clear area is provided between the
unit and the property line to permit emergency personnel to pass safely
without obstruction;



         (b)   Where a commercial use abuts a residential use,
heating and air conditioning units shall only be permitted in the rear yard
or the roof;



         (c)   Existing heating and air conditioning units which
do not conform with the above provisions may continue to operate as
nonconforming uses. A nonconforming heating and air conditioning unit may be
replaced with a unit equal to or smaller in physical size and quieter; and



         (d)   Variation from the provisions of this division may
be authorized by application to the Inspection Office. Upon review of the
application by the Building Official and Fire Chief and determination that an
exceptional or unusual physical arrangement of a home on a lot exists which
would prevent the location of a heating and air conditioning unit in another
yard area and public health and safety will not be compromised by the
proposed location, a variation may be granted. A denial by the Building
Official and Fire Chief is subject to appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals.



      (2)   The above provisions do not apply to window air
conditioning units.



   (J)   Temporary vendor buildings or tents are required to obtain a
building permit, which is valid for a six-month period between March 15 and
December 31. Temporary vendor buildings shall be immediately removed from the
property when not in use or on or before December 31. Adequate off- street
parking shall be provided and the building shall not reduce the required
off-street parking of the permanent enterprise. Restrooms are required to be
available to the public and be located within 300 feet of the temporary
vendor building.



   (K)   On corner lots in R districts with widths of 60 feet or less,
accessory buildings may be built no closer than ten feet to the side street
right-of-way.

   (J)   Fences shall be constructed of materials customarily used and
manufactured as common fence materials. Materials such as broken boards or
discarded materials, wire mesh, tin, tarps and other similar coverings

NONCONFORMING USES



§ 162.125  PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the regulation of
nonconforming uses, buildings and structures and to specify those
circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming uses, buildings and
structures may be continued. It is, however, the purpose and intent of this
subchapter that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually eliminated. This
subchapter shall be liberally construed to this end.



(1980 Code, § 29.801)



§ 162.126  DEFINITIONS.



   For purposes of this subchapter and the entire zoning chapter, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning



   ENLARGEMENT, EXTENSION AND STRUCTURAL ALTERATION.



      (1)   A nonconforming use, building or structure will be
considered ENLARGED, EXTENDED OR STRUCTURALLY ALTERED if:



         (a)   There is or will be any material or substantial
change in the construction, identity and/or use of the present building or
structure, including but not limited to a change in the goods sold or
manufactured upon the premises;



         (b)   There is or will be any change in the supporting
members of a building or structure, such as bearing walls or partitions,
columns, beams or girders, or any complete rebuilding of the roof or the
exterior walls, other than a minor alteration which affects primarily the
appearance and not the life of the structure;



         (c)   There is or will be an addition to the floor area
of an existing building, an increase in the size of any other structure, or
an increase in that portion of a tract of land occupied by an existing use
(including but not limited to an expanded parking area);



         (d)   There is or will be an increase or amplification
in the intensity of a use, building or structure; or



         (e)   There is or will be an addition of a different
entrance or access to the building, structure or premises.



      (2)   A nonconforming use, building or structure may be
considered ENLARGED, EXTENDED or STRUCTURALLY ALTERED for other reasons than
those set forth specifically herein consistent with the purpose and intent of
this subchapter and this chapter.



   NONCONFORMING BUILDING OR STRUCTURE.  Any building or structure which:



      (1)   Does not comply with all of the regulations of this
zoning chapter or of any amendment hereto governing bulk for the zoning
district in which the building or structure is located; or



      (2)   Is designed or intended for a nonconforming use.



   NONCONFORMING USE.  Any use of land, buildings or structures which
does not comply with all of the regulations of this zoning chapter or of any
amendment hereto governing use for the zoning district in which the use is
located.



   USE.  Refers to the specific and particular use involved, not the
general category of use involved. For example, a specific and particular use
would be the sale of certain specific and particular goods and products at
retail rather than the general use of sale of goods and products at retail.



(1980 Code, § 29.801)



§ 162.127  CONTINUATION.



   Any nonconforming use, building or structure which existed lawfully on
the effective date of this amendatory zoning chapter and which remains
nonconforming, and any use, building or structure which shall become
nonconforming upon the adoption of this subchapter or of any subsequent
amendments thereto, may be continued subject to the limitations set forth in
this subchapter. This subchapter shall not be construed as authorizing the
continuation of any use, building or structure, which was not so lawfully
existing. The provisions hereof shall not only apply to a building or
structure which is completely occupied by the nonconforming use, but shall
also apply to one in which the nonconforming use occupies only a portion of
the building or structure.



(1980 Code, § 29.801)



§ 162.128  FUTURE EXTENSIONS OF JURISDICTION.



   If a use, building or structure becomes subject to this subchapter,
whether by the extension of the zoning jurisdiction of the city by reason of
extension of the corporate of the city, or otherwise, and the use, building
or land at the time it becomes subject to this subchapter is lawful but does
not conform with the regulations of the district in which the use, building
or structure is situated, the use, building or structure may continue as a
nonconforming use, building or structure under the provisions hereof.



(1980 Code, § 29.801)



§ 162.129  REGISTRATION OF NONCONFORMING USE, BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.



   (A)   Generally.  To better provide for the enforcement of the
provisions of this subchapter and this chapter, all nonconforming uses,
buildings and structures shall be registered in accordance herewith, except
as otherwise provided herein. In the event the owner or other interested
party fails to register a nonconforming use in accordance herewith on or
before December 31, 1980, the use shall not be considered a nonconforming use
for purposes hereof. Thereafter, a nonconforming use which has not been
registered may not be continued unless a special permit for the nonconforming
use is obtained. If not timely registered, there shall be no right to a
special permit. A special permit may be issued in the same manner as any
other special permit. The nonconforming use, building or structure may not be
continued if not so registered or a special permit obtained. The use,
building or structure shall thereafter conform with the provisions of this
subchapter applicable to the district involved. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the owner or other interested party need not register
any nonconformity resulting from bulk requirements, or on account of
off-street parking requirements. It is the intent of this subchapter that
only nonconformity because of use need be registered.



   (B)   Future extensions of jurisdiction and nonconformity.  Where a
nonconforming use, building or structure exists by reason of the extension of
the zoning jurisdiction of the city or by virtue of changes in the zoning
regulations occurring before January 1, 1997, the nonconforming use, building
or structure must be registered in accordance with this subchapter before
April 1, 1997. Thereafter, the nonconforming uses which have not been
registered may not be continued unless a special permit for the nonconforming
use is obtained. Where a nonconforming use, building or structure exists by
reason of the extension of the zoning jurisdiction of the city or by virtue
of changes in the zoning regulations occurring after January 1, 1997, the
nonconforming use, building or structure must be registered in accordance
with this subchapter within 90 days following written notice to the owner of
the use, building or structure by the Department of Planning and Development
that the use, building or structure is nonconforming.



   (C)   Registration procedures.



      (1)   Statement of nonconformity.  To register a
nonconforming use in accordance herewith, the owner or other interested party
shall file a statement of nonconformity with the Building Inspector setting
forth the name or names of all owners of the property involved; the common or
street address of the property; the legal description of the property; the
real estate tax number of the property; the zoning district in which the
property is located; the zoning district in which the nonconforming use,
building or structure would have to be located in order to be conforming; the
specific nature, character and extent of the nonconforming use as it exists
on the date of the statement; the date on which the nonconforming use or
prior nonconforming uses commenced; the period or periods during which the
nonconforming use was discontinued or the building or structure was vacant
and unoccupied; and any additional information as the Building Inspector may
require.



      (2)   Certificate of nonconformance.  Within 60 days after
receipt of a statement of nonconformity, the Building Inspector shall issue a
certificate of nonconformity relative to the use, building or structure if it
reasonably appears from the statement of nonconformity and any independent
investigation the Building Inspector may conduct that the use, building or
structure is a lawful nonconforming use. The certificate of nonconformance is
issued, in effect, to the property. A future certificate shall not be
required even if there is a change of ownership. A nonconforming use shall
not be considered registered until a certificate of nonconformance is issued,
provided that once issued it will be considered as having been issued on the
date the statement of nonconformity was filed with the Building Inspector. If
a certificate of nonconformance is not issued within 60 days, the Building
Inspector shall be considered to have refused to issue the same. In the event
that the Building Inspector refuses to issue a certificate of nonconformance
or fails to issue the certificate of nonconformance within 60 days after
receipt of a statement of nonconformity as aforesaid, the decision may be
appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals as any other decision of the Building
Inspector.



      (3)   Obligation of owner.  The obligation for obtaining a
certificate of nonconformance rests solely with the owner or other interested
party.



      (4)   Effect of certificate and revocation.  Absent material
inaccuracies or misstatements contained in the statement of nonconformity
filed with the Building Inspector, once a certificate of nonconformance is
issued, the nonconforming use shall be presumed to exist as described in the
statement of nonconformance. A certificate may be revoked by the Building
Inspector if any material inaccuracies of misstatements are discovered.
Further, a certificate may be revoked by the Building Inspector if the
provisions of these regulations governing nonconformity are violated by
failing to obtain



a necessary special permit or otherwise.



      (5)   Fees.  The Building Inspector shall not charge a fee
for the issuance of a certificate of nonconformance prior to January 1, 1980.
Thereafter, a fee of $10 will be charged upon the filing of the application.
If desired by the owner or other interested party, the Building Inspector for
a fee of $5 shall provide a certified copy of the certificates of
nonconformance suitable for placing of record.



      (6)   Special use.  This subchapter does not limit or negate
the option of applying for a special permit use relative to a nonconforming
use.



(1980 Code, § 29.801)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.130  CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USE.



   A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or of a higher classification except by a special permit issued
pursuant to § 162.030. Once a special permit is granted allowing for a
change to another nonconforming use, the use may not again be changed to
another nonconforming use, even to the use previously existing, without again
obtaining a special permit as aforesaid. A nonconforming use may not be
changed to a use in a lower classification. For the purposes hereof, the
terms HIGHER CLASSIFICATION and LOWER CLASSIFICATION mean uses higher or
lower (above and below) on the list of districts in § 162.030(B) than the
district in which the subject use would be classified if a conforming use.
The RU1 District thus being the higher classification and the M3 District
thus being the lowest classification. In the event a change is made to
another use which itself requires a special permit, a special permit must be
obtained not only for the change of the nonconforming use, but for the other
use itself. The requirements of all applicable special permits must be
complied with. Once the right to continue the nonconforming use terminates,
however, the special permit shall automatically terminate irrespective of any
provisions of this chapter to the contrary.

§ 162.131  ENLARGEMENT, EXTENSION AND STRUCTURAL ALTERATION.



   A nonconforming use, building or structure may not be enlarged,
extended or structurally altered in any manner unless the nonconforming use,
building or structure after so enlarged, extended or altered is made to
conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is located or
unless a special permit is issued therefore pursuant to § 162.030. Whether a
change to a nonconforming use, building or structure is to be considered an
enlargement, extension or structural alteration of a nonconforming use is to
be liberally construed in favor of a conclusion that the change is an
enlargement, extension or structural alteration, it being the purpose and
intent hereof that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually eliminated or
strictly regulated. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, normal
maintenance of a building or structure containing a nonconforming use or
being nonconforming is permitted provided there are not enlargements,
extensions or structural alterations.



(1980 Code, § 29.801)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.132  DISCONTINUANCE OF USE.



   If a nonconforming use is discontinued, or a nonconforming building or
structure is vacant, and remains unoccupied for a continuous period of six
months or a total of six months within any 12-month period, the nonconforming
use, building or structure shall not thereafter be occupied or used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which the use, building or
structure is located.



(1980 Code, § 29.801)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.133  DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.



   If a building or structure containing a nonconforming use, or a
building or structure otherwise nonconforming, is by any means or cause
damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50% or more of its fair market value
immediately before the damage or destruction, the building, structure or
reconstruction thereof shall thereafter be occupied and used only for a
conforming use or otherwise in conformity with the regulations applicable to
the district in which the same is located. In the event that the damage or
destruction is less than 50%, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made
unless the reconstruction is started within one year from the date of the
partial destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion. A building or
structure shall be considered damaged or destroyed to the extent of 50% or
more of its fair market value immediately before the damage or destruction if
the costs of the reconstruction is 50% or more of the fair market value,
basing the fair market value solely on the real property tax assessment of
the building or structure for the assessment period most recently available.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS



§ 162.150  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of the planned development regulations set forth in this
subchapter is to encourage and allow more flexible, creative and imaginative
use and design of land and property developments than is otherwise possible
under district zoning regulations. Planned developments are intended to
provide for the efficient and economical use and development of land and
property in a manner which is compatible with surrounding existing uses or
prospective uses. This purpose is deemed by the city to be especially
important due to the size, growth patterns and existing uses of land and
property in the city and its environs. Uses and developments of land and
properties may be compatible and appropriate although not otherwise
consistent with district zoning regulations. The uses and developments found
compatible may be allowed, irrespective of any other regulations of this
chapter, or other applicable ordinances of the city as provided in this
subchapter as planned developments.



(1980 Code, § 29.901)



§ 162.151  SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES.



   Without in any way limiting the scope of this subchapter, this
subchapter is designed to accomplish the following specific objectives:



   (A)   To permit a maximum choice in the types of environment
available to the public by allowing a development that would not be possible
under the strict application of the other sections of this chapter or other
applicable ordinances of the city;



   (B)   To promote a creative approach to the use of land and related
physical facilities that results in better design and development, with the
inclusion of aesthetic amenities;



   (C)   To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms
and building relationships with a possible mixing of different urban uses in
an innovative design;



   (D)   To encourage a pattern of development to preserve natural
vegetation, topographic and geological features and environmentally
appropriate features;



   (E)   To provide for the prevention and/or control of soil erosion,
surface flooding and the preservation of sub-surface water;



   (F)   To create a method for the permanent preservation of common
open space for the continued use and enjoyment of the residents of the
development;



   (G)   To promote the more efficient use of the land resulting in
more economic networks of utilities, streets and other facilities;



   (H)   To encourage a land use which promotes the public health,
safety, comfort, morals and welfare;



   (I)   To create a method for the permanent preservation or
architectural and/or historic landmarks;



   (J)   To provide a means for the development of existing properties
which cannot otherwise be economically or reasonably developed based on
district zoning regulations;



   (K)   To assure that the development of land and properties are
consistent with adjoining uses and developments, whether existing or
prospective; and



   (L)   To provide a means by which the city can allow the use and
development of land and property which is consistent with the comprehensive
planning of the city and surrounding uses and developments without modifying
the district zoning scheme established by this chapter.



(1980 Code, § 29.902)



§ 162.152  PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.



   (A)   Definition.  For the purposes of this subchapter, the
following definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.



      PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.  Any tract of land regardless of size
approved as a planned development pursuant to the provision of this
subchapter.



   (B)   Development.  A planned development is intended to provide
for projects incorporating either a single type use or a variety of related
uses planned and developed as a unit. The development may consist of
conventionally subdivided lots to be sold, un-subdivided single ownership,
separate condominium ownership of structures, or other ownership methods, and
shall provide for development by means of a planned development plat which
establishes the location and extent of any special features of the planned
development in keeping with the purpose of the plan. A planned development
may be located as a special use in any zoning district. Any use may be
located as a planned development.



(1980 Code, § 29.903)



§ 162.153  GENERAL PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Special use.  A planned development shall be granted as a
special use in accord with the procedures and standards of this subchapter
and may depart from the normal procedures, standards and other requirements
of the other sections of this chapter or this code to the extent inconsistent
with this subchapter.



   (B)   Application.  Applications shall be on forms prescribed by
the Secretary of the Plan Commission and shall be accompanied by the plats,
plans or documents as may be prescribed by this subchapter or by the
Secretary of the Plan Commission. Unless otherwise prescribed by the
Secretary of the Plan Commission, ten copies of any supporting plats or
related documents shall be submitted. On review of any application as
provided in this subchapter, the Plan Commission, the City Council or other
reviewing authority may require that the application and supporting documents
be supplemented as deemed appropriate.



(1980 Code, § 29.904)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.154  CONCEPTUAL PLAN.



   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of a conceptual plan submission is to
obtain the general approval of the city for the development of land or
property in accord with the plans, programs and schedule submitted as a part
of the planned development application. It is intended that the proposal
submitted will be in preliminary conceptual form and that, following the
anticipated approval, the developer will proceed with preparing detailed
plans for all or a portion of the site for submission as a preliminary plat.
This procedure allows for approval of an overall concept without the
necessity of prejudging long-range markets and preparing precise plans for
unknown quantities and allows the developer to complete long-range
commitments knowing the developer has a viable and acceptable project. The
conceptual plan procedure is not mandatory and the developer may select to
proceed directly to the preliminary plat and final plat procedure.



   (B)   Procedure.  A request for the approval of a conceptual plan
shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Plan Commission. The plan shall be
presented to the Plan Commission for review and comment. The Plan Commission
shall provide its comments and suggestions as appropriate. The Plan
Commission may approve or disapprove the general concept of the plan.
Approval or disapproval shall not necessarily require subsequent approval or
disapproval. However, if requested by the applicant, a public hearing shall
be scheduled as provided below in this subchapter. After the hearing, the
Plan Commission shall make its formal recommendation to the City Council
relative to the conceptual plan. If approved by the City Council, the
approval shall constitute a zoning acceptance of the specific content of the
conceptual plan and shall indicate the general acceptance of the City Council
and commitment to approve a plat that carries out, refines and implements the
concepts expressed in the conceptual plan. The preliminary plat and final
plat shall be submitted for approval in accordance with this subchapter
within a period not to exceed one year from the date of approval of the
conceptual plan. If not so submitted, the approval shall be automatically
deemed withdrawn. The preliminary plat, if submitted after a hearing, shall
be approved as a planned development plat if it conforms substantially with
the principles and concepts presented in the conceptual plan. No building
permit shall be issued for any structure until the final plat has been filed,
approved and recorded.



(1980 Code, § 29.905)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.155  PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Purpose.  The purpose of the preliminary plat submission is
to obtain the approval and/or commitments from the city that the plans,
design and program that the developer intends to build and follow are
acceptable, and that the developer can reasonably proceed into final detailed
architecture, engineering, surveying and landscape architecture in
anticipation of final plat approval and subsequent construction. This is a
relatively detailed submission that assures the developer that the
developer’s plan is acceptable and that the developer can invest the money
necessary to prepare final plans with the assurance that the final plat and
plans will be accepted if they substantially conform to the preliminary plat
and plans. It is at this stage that final modifications, adjustments and
interpretations are made to the conceptual plan, if any.



   (B)   Procedure.



      (1)   Submission.  A request for preliminary plat approval of
the planned development shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Plan
Commission who shall refer the same to the Plan Commission for public
hearing, report and recommendation as to whether or not the City Council
should issue the special use permit applied for.



      (2)   Hearing.  The Plan Commission shall hold a public
hearing on the application for a planned development in accord with the
procedures set forth below in this subchapter.



      (3)   Recommendations.  Following the public hearing and
review of the preliminary planned development plat and supporting data for
conformity to these regulations, the Plan Commission shall, within 60 days,
unless an extension is requested or approved by the applicant, recommend
approval, modification or disapproval, and the reasons therefore, or indicate
why a report and recommendation cannot be rendered to the City Council.



      (4)   City Council action.  The City Council, after receipt
of the preliminary planned development plat from the Plan Commission, shall
approve, modify or disapprove the preliminary plat within a period of 60 days
unless an extension is requested or approved by the applicant. In the case of
approval, or approval with modification, the City Council shall pass an
ordinance granting the special use and indicate its approval upon the plat
(by signature of the City Clerk), and arrange zoning map modifications as
necessary (designating the area involved as a planned development). The City
Council may require special conditions, as it may deem necessary to ensure
conformance with the intent of the planning objectives of the city and its
environs and the stated objectives of the planned development provisions of
this subchapter.



      (5)   Effect of approval.  Approval of a preliminary planned
development plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather it
shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the
preliminary plat as a final guide to the preparation of the final plat which
will be submitted for the approval of the city and subsequent recording upon
the fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and any conditions
of the preliminary approval, if any. The final plat shall be approved as
hereinafter provided if it conforms with the preliminary plat.



      (6)   Building permit.  No building permit shall be issued
for any structure until the final plat has been filed, approved or recorded.



      (7)   Subdivision approval.  A subdivision in accordance
Chapter 161 of this code may be combined with the plats required hereunder
provided that the requirements of that subchapter are additionally complied
with. In that event, it shall be noted on the plat that the plat is being
approved both as a planned development and as a subdivision. Unless otherwise
prescribed thereon, the approval of the planned development and the
subdivision shall be deemed independent of each other. Thus, if the planned
development is subsequently abandoned, the subdivision shall nevertheless be
considered effective as a subdivision. The subdivision would be subject to
any applicable zoning restrictions, however, as if not a planned development.
The property will not, however, be allowed to be treated as a nonconforming
use based on any use as a planned development nor any prior nonconforming
use. The subdivision plat may be separately recorded as such in order to give
effect to this provision. This provision shall not in any way limit the
authority of the city hereunder to allow the subdivision and sale of real
estate as part of a planned development and to not impose requirements which
may otherwise apply to the subdivision pursuant to Chapter 161. In other
words, a planned development may be adopted for a subdivision established (or
being established) under Chapter 161, or the subdivision of real estate may
be made a part of a planned development itself.



(1980 Code, § 29.906)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.156  FINAL PLAT PROCEDURE.



   (A) Purpose.  The purpose of the final plat is to designate with
particularity the planned development. The final plat is intended to be a
document which will be recorded. The final plat shows the location of
facilities with reasonable accuracy, while the preliminary plat shows the
general location of the same facilities.



   (B)   Procedure.  The final plat shall be submitted as a planned
development plat and shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as
approved and, if desired by the developer, may be submitted in stages with
each stage reflecting the approved preliminary plat which is proposed to be
recorded and developed; provided, however, that the portion conforms to all
requirements of these regulations. The required procedure for approval of the
final plat shall be as follows.



      (1)   Director of Utilities and Engineering.  A final planned
development plat and other supporting data required for approval shall be
submitted to the Director of Utilities and Engineering. Final plats and
supporting data shall show in detail the design, location and use of all
buildings, facilities and site improvements as well as any additional
information as the City Council, the Plan Commission, the Director of
Utilities and Engineering or the Secretary of the Plan Commission may require
or have required.



      (2)   Certification.  After the review by the Director of
Utilities and Engineering, the final plat and supporting data shall be
certified by the City Clerk, the Director of Utilities and Engineering and
the Secretary of the Plan Commission as being in conformity with these
regulations and in agreement with the approved preliminary plat. If the City
Clerk, the Director of Utilities and Engineering or the Secretary of the Plan
Commission shall not consider the plat and plans to be in conformity with the
preliminary plat approved, then the official shall refer the plat back to the
City Council for the review and approval of any modifications. Thereafter,
the plat shall again be resubmitted as a final plat for approval and
certification.



(1980 Code, § 29.907)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.157  RECORDING FINAL PLAT.



   No building permits shall be issued relative to a planned development
until the final plat therefore and all other related documents, such as
restrictive covenants, shall have been duly recorded in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds of the county. Any construction authorized shall be in full
compliance with the final planned development plat as recorded. The ordinance
authorizing construction of the planned development shall be effective only
upon recording of the final planned development plat and any related
supporting documents. The recording of the final plat shall constitute notice
to all who deal with the planned development of the restrictions placed upon
the land and act as a zoning control device. As such, its requirements shall
be enforceable by the city or any other interested party.



(1980 Code, § 29.908)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.158  CHANGES IN THE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.



   (A)   Generally.  The planned development project shall be
developed only according to the approved and recorded final plat and all
supporting data. The recorded final plat and supporting data together with
all recorded amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors,
grantees and assigns and shall limit and control the use of the premises and
location of structures in the planned development project as set forth
therein.



   (B)   Changes.  Changes to the recorded planned development may be
made as follows.



      (1)   Major changes.  Changes which alter the concept or
intent of the planned development including not limited to changes in
density, changes in the height of buildings, reductions of proposed open
space, changes in total bedroom counts, changes in the development schedule,
changes in road standards, or changes in the final governing agreements,
provisions or covenants, or other changes may be approved only by submission
and reconsideration of a new preliminary and final planned development plat
and supporting data and following the preliminary or final plat procedure. If
the major change alters data or evidence submitted during the conceptual plan
or preliminary plat stage, then the resubmission must begin at the
preliminary plat stage. If major changes are proposed, a new public hearing
shall be required during resubmission of the plat. All changes to the
“original” final plat shall be recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds
as amendments to the final plat are reflected in the recording of a new
“corrected” final plat.



      (2)   Minor changes.  The City Council, after receiving a
recommendation thereon from the Plan Commission, may approve minor changes in
the planned development which do not change the concept or intent of the
development. Minor changes shall be any change not defined as a major change.
The determination of the City Council as to what is a major or minor change
shall be a final determination of that question.



      (3)   Abandoned.  A planned development may be abandoned by
the owner or owners of the land and property involved, provided that the use
of the land and property shall thereafter conform with the district zoning
requirements otherwise applicable at the time of abandonment. No property
will be allowed to be treated as a nonconforming use based on any use as a
planned development nor any prior nonconforming use.



(1980 Code, § 29.909)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.159  SUBMISSION TIMING AND REVERSION CLAUSE.



   (A)   Final plat.  The final plat or plats, if more than one, must
be submitted for approval in accordance with agreed to scheduling. The final
plat or first final plat, if more than one, must be submitted for final
approval not later than one year from the approval of the preliminary plat
unless otherwise prescribed by the City Council. Actual construction, if any,
as authorized must begin within one year from the date of the approval of the
find plat. Actual construction shall require, at a minimum, if buildings are
to be constructed, actual work on the components of the buildings and not
mere land preparation and architectural planning. In the event that the same
is not done, the planned development special use shall be null and void and
the subject property shall revert to the zoning classification affixed to
that property prior to the issuance of a planned development special use, or
the Plan Commission shall initiate zoning changes as it deems necessary to
serve the public interest.



   (B)   Conceptual plan and preliminary plat.  If conceptual plan
approval is granted and the preliminary plat or first preliminary plat, if
more than one, is not submitted for review within one year of the approval or
as otherwise prescribed, then the aforementioned procedure dealing with
reversion for final plats shall be followed.



   (C)   Extensions.  Extensions in the building schedule for
individual one-year periods may be recommended by the Plan Commission and
granted by the City Council. If the City Council so stipulates when acting
favorably on a planned development, the Plan Commission may be delegated the
authority of granting extensions in the building schedule for periods of up
to one year.



   (D)   Abandonment.  If a planned development is abandoned or not
timely completed, then the subject property shall revert to the zoning
classification affixed to the property prior to the issuance of the planned
development special use.



(1980 Code, § 29.910)  Penalty, see § 162.999



§ 162.160  PLATS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION.



   (A)   Generally.  Plats and supporting documentation shall provide
all relevant or material information regarding the proposed planned
development. Supplemental information may required by any reviewing
authority, including, but not limited to, the City Council, the Plan
Commission, the Secretary of the Plan Commission and the Director of
Utilities and Engineering. In this subchapter, when reference is made to
plat, that term also includes any supporting documents.



   (B)   Conceptual plan.  A conceptual plan shall be prepared to
scale and provide a clear understanding of the way in which the property is
intended to be developed. The information called for in preliminary and final
plats should be considered in preparing and presenting a conceptual plan. The
information is not, however, necessarily required. What should be included is
dependent upon the particular planned development involved.



   (C)   Preliminary plat.  A preliminary plat shall be prepared to
scale and provide a detailed plan of the way in which the property is
intended to be developed. The plat shall be prepared by some person qualified
to prepare the same and be in a scale of not less than one inch equals 100
feet. The plan shall specify all information relevant or material to the
plan. The following information should be considered in preparing and

LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS



§ 162.180  DECLARATION.



   (A)   Historically and architecturally significant buildings
throughout this community are tangible links with the nation’s past and
help provide a sense of identity and stability that is often missing in this
era of constant change. By highlighting a community’s roots and unique
character, historic preservation reinforces the traditional American values
of neighborhood and family. Preservation is an anchor that keeps communities
together and re-establishes pride and economic vitality.



   (B)   The study of relics, burial grounds and village sites
indicates that man from prehistoric times has selected the site of Quincy as
a desirable location to live.



   (C)   The westernmost city in Illinois, Quincy is located along the
eastern shore of the Mississippi River atop 100-foot limestone bluffs which
overlook a wide expanse of the river and a natural harbor. John Wood founded
Quincy in 1822, settling on land that was part of a large area set aside as a
Military Bounty Tract for the War of 1812. The little settlement was first
called The Bluffs but was renamed Quincy in 1825 when Adams County was
incorporated. The county, the city, and what is now Washington Park were
named in honor of the then current President of the United States, John
Quincy Adams.



   (D)   A few of the events that were important to Quincy’s history
in the early years were the Blackhawk War, the Morman involvement, the
Lincoln-Douglas debate in 1858, and the anti-slavery movement. Quincy was a
stop on the underground railroad. Prosperous industries and commercial
establishments including breweries, stove manufacturers, steamboat
construction companies, farm implement businesses, and wholesale and retail
stores helped in the development of the community. Quincy’s growth
encouraged German, English, Scots and Irish immigrants to settle in the city
and their craftsmen helped in the building of many homes and commercial
buildings.



   (E)   During the Civil War, Quincy was important as a supply center.
Injured soldiers were brought from the battlefield and treated in hospitals
built and manned by Quincy residents, and four regiments were trained and
stationed in camps located to the north, south and east of the city. John
Wood had just completed his term as Governor in 1861, and was named
Quartermaster General of the State, thus becoming the highest ranking officer
in Illinois. Abraham Lincoln appointed Wood as the Illinois delegate for the
Civil War Peace Conference.



   (F)   Following the war, Quincy entered its “Gilded Age,” a
period of great prosperity due to the growth of the railroad and industry. By
1875, Quincy was the second largest city in Illinois.



   (G)   Neighborhoods developed first in the south, then north, and
finally east in Quincy. The architecture reflects a variety of styles from
log cabin, Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic and Italianate to Romanesque,
Second Empire, Queen Anne, Colonial and Classical Revival, Bungalow, Prairie
Style, Shingle Style, Stick Style, Quincy Style, Art Moderne and
International Style.



   (H)   Quincy is in the distinguished position of being recognized as
one of the three cities in the state having an outstanding collection of
architecturally and historically significant structures. Equally important is
the recognition of neighborhoods that developed at various time periods in
the history of Quincy, and the maintenance of these properties and areas
develops a sense of well being, stability and community pride.



   (I)   It is hereby found and declared by the City Council of the
city that the goals of historic preservation, community development and
economic growth are compatible and the city intends to further the use of
preservation as a tool to help revitalize and strengthen the city’s economy.



   (J)   It is declared by the City Council of the city that it is
required in the interest of the public’s health, safety and general
welfare, and is necessary to sound urban planning that those properties and
improvements having special historical, architectural, community or aesthetic
significance, be designated, preserved, enhanced and continued or restored to
use, it being further declared that the city’s economic vitality and tax
base cannot be maintained and enhanced without regard for the city’s
heritage and older neighborhoods.



(1980 Code, § 29.1001)



§ 162.181  PURPOSE.



   (A)   To survey, designate, identify, preserve, rehabilitate,
enhance and perpetuate those properties and improvements which reflect the
historical, cultural, artistic, social, ethnic or other heritage of the
nation, state or community, or which may be representative of an
architectural style or engineering method inherently valuable for the study
of a period, craftsmanship, type of construction or use of indigenous
materials;



   (B)   To promote the public health, safety and welfare;



   (C)   To advance sound urban planning;



   (D)   To stabilize and improve the economic vitality and value of
the designated properties and improvements in particular and of the city in
general;



   (E)   To foster civic pride in the beauty and accomplishments of the
past and to promote the education of the general public concerning historical
and architectural preservation;



   (F)   To enhance the city’s attraction to visitors and thereby
stimulate tourism, commerce and industry; and



   (G)   To encourage the continued private ownership and use of
designated properties and improvements to the maximum extent consistent with
the above objectives.

Commission shall send a written report to the Quincy City Council within 60
days following its decision. The report shall summarize the reasons for the
Quincy Preservation Commission’s decision. In the event of a decision to

historical or architectural features, and specific standards for the review
of exterior alterations recommended by the Quincy Preservation Commission,
any local economic incentives recommended by the Quincy Preservation
Commission, and the types of alterations not requiring a building permit that
shall require a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to § 162.190.



   (K)   Quincy City Council designation by ordinance.  The Quincy
City Council shall review the report and recommendation of the Quincy

as set forth in § 162.188, and according to the same standards and
considerations for designation.



(1980 Code, § 29.1010)



§ 162.190  PROTECTION PROVIDED LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.



   (A)   Certificate of appropriateness.



      (1)   Actions requiring a certificate of appropriateness.  A
certificate of appropriateness issued by the Quincy Preservation Commission
shall be required for the following actions affecting the exterior
architectural appearance of any Landmark or property within a Historic
District:



         (a)   Any alteration to the significant historical or
architectural features listed in the designating ordinance;



         (b)   Any exterior construction or alteration requiring
a building permit from the city; and



         (c)   Any substantial alteration to the exterior portion
of the property.



      (2)   Actions not requiring a certificate of
appropriateness.  Unless the action is covered by the specific standards as
outlined in division (A)(1)(a) above of this section, actions which shall not
require a certificate of appropriateness, and are not considered substantial
alterations, include the following:



         (a)   Any construction, alteration or removal limited to
the interior portions of the structure;



         (b)   Actions, which constitute landscaping, grounds
keeping or similar exterior activities limited to the environs of the
designated structure or structures; and



         (c)   Actions commonly considered to be normal or
routine owner maintenance to include painting, staining or cleaning of
exterior surfaces (with the exclusion of sandblasting of surfaces); repair or
replacement of damaged or unserviceable items so long as the repair or
replacement is consistent with the original item; and the installation of
storm windows.



      (3)   Applications for certificate of appropriateness.



         (a)   An application for a certificate of
appropriateness shall be obtained from and filed with the Secretary at the
office of the Quincy Preservation Commission. Any applicant can request
information from the Secretary, Chairperson or any member of the Quincy
Preservation Commission regarding the application.



         (b)   Every application for a building permit, including
any available accompanying plans and specifications affecting the exterior
architectural appearance of a nominated or designated Historic District,
shall be sent by the Inspection Department to the Secretary within three
working days following receipt of the application by the Inspection
Department. The Inspection Department shall not issue the building permit
until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by the Quincy
Preservation Commission.



         (c)   This section shall apply to nominated Landmarks
and nominated Historic Districts from the date the Quincy Preservation
Commission determines that an application for nomination merits further
consideration pursuant to § 162.187.



      (4)   Commission votes on certificate of appropriateness. 
The Secretary shall immediately forward an application for a certificate of
appropriateness to the Quincy Preservation Commission for its review at its
next regular meeting. At that meeting, the Quincy Preservation Commission
shall vote to approve or deny the application.



      (5)   Denial of certificate of appropriateness.  A denial of
a certificate of appropriateness by the Quincy Preservation Commission shall
be sent to the applicant accompanied by a statement from the Secretary for
the reasons of the denial.



      (6)   Commission meets with property owner.  The Quincy
Preservation Commission shall make recommendations to the applicant
concerning modifications, if any, in the proposed action which would cause
the Quincy Preservation Commission to reconsider its denial, and shall confer
with the applicant and attempt to resolve as quickly as possible the
difference between the objectives of the owner and the goals of the Quincy
Preservation Commission.



      (7)   Second vote.  Should these discussions fail to resolve
the differences, there shall be a second vote on the application by the
Quincy Preservation Commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting. A
vote by a majority of the appointed and confirmed members of the Quincy
Preservation Commission to deny the certificate of appropriateness shall be
the final decision unless appealed pursuant to § 162.193. If less than a
majority of the appointed and confirmed members of the Quincy Preservation
Commission vote to deny the certificate of appropriateness, the application
shall be considered approved.



      (8)   Applicant and Inspection Department informed of
decision.  The Secretary shall inform the applicant and the Inspection
Department in writing of the Quincy Preservation Commission’s decision
within three working days following the second vote.

Upon denial of an application, the applicant may appeal the decision as
provided for in § 162.193.



      (11)   Subcommittee.  The Quincy Preservation Commission may
establish a subcommittee of no fewer than five of its members to review
routine applications for a certificate of appropriateness when delay to the
next regular meeting would create unnecessary inconvenience to the applicant.
A certificate of appropriateness may be issued prior to the next regular
meeting upon the signature of 80% of the members of the subcommittee.



   (B)   Standards for review of applications.  In considering an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Quincy Preservation
Commission shall be guided by the following general standards in addition to
any other specific standards in the ordinance designating the Landmark or
Historic District. These general standards shall apply even in the absence of
any specific standards for a Landmark or a Historic District.



      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a
compatible use for a property, which requires minimal alteration of the
building, structure or site and its environment, or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.



      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a
building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
feature should be avoided when possible.



      (4)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized
as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.



      (5)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time
are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site
and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their
own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.



      (6)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be
treated with sensitivity.



      (7)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired
rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event the replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplication of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence ratter than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.



      (8)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken
with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.



      (9)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and
preserve archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to, any project.



      (10)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to
existing properties shall not be discouraged when the alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural
material, and the design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material
and character of the property neighborhood or environment.



(1980 Code, § 29.1011)



§ 162.191  DEMOLITION.



   (A)   Actions requiring a certificate of demolition.  A certificate
for demolition from the Quincy Preservation Commission shall be required for
any demolition or removal in whole or in part which requires a permit from
the city. This section shall apply to a nominated or designated Landmark or
Historic District from the date the Quincy Preservation Commission determines
that an application for nomination merits further consideration pursuant to
§ 162.187.



   (B)   Application for a certificate of demolition.



         (1)   An application for a certificate of demolition
shall be obtained from and filed with the Secretary at the office of the
Quincy Preservation Commission. Any applicant can request information from
the Secretary, Chairperson or any member of the Quincy Preservation
Commission.



         (2)   Every application for a demolition permit,
including, when available, accompanying plans and specifications affecting
the nominated or designated Landmark or a property within a nominated or
designated Historic District, shall be sent by the Inspection Department to
the Secretary within three working days following receipt of the application
by the Inspection Department. The Inspection Department shall not issue a
permit until a certificate of demolition has been issued by the Quincy
Preservation Commission.



   (C)   Secretary notifies Commission.  The Secretary shall notify
the Quincy Preservation Commission of any application for a certificate of
demolition.



   (D)   Public hearing.  Upon receipt of the application for a
certificate of demolition, the Quincy Preservation Commission shall schedule
a public hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting. Notice of the
public hearing shall be given to the applicant and the property owner in the
same manner as required by § 162.188(C). In the event the application is
received less than 15 days to the regularly schedule meeting, that
application shall be heard at the following regularly scheduled meeting. At
the public hearing the Quincy Preservation Commission shall hear evidence and
testimony and consider the following issues:



      (1)   The condition of the property and how the condition
affects the feasibility of preservation, rehabilitation or restoration of the
property;



      (2)   The general feasibility of preservation, rehabilitation
or restoration and any economic hardship to the property owner from the
denial of a certificate of demolition;



      (3)   Ways in which the interest of the public in preserving
the property may be balanced against the interests of the owner of the
property;



      (4)   Alternatives to demolition;



      (5)   The interest or quality in the property that would make
demolition a loss to the general community;



      (6)   Any unusual or uncommon design elements and materials
that cannot be reproduced or reproduced only with great difficulty;



      (7)   Whether the property is of such interest or quality that
it is listed or could be listed on the National Register of Historic Places,
Illinois State Register or as a local Landmark;



      (8)   Whether retention of the structure would help preserve
and protect a historic place or area of historic interest in the city; and



      (9)   Whether retention of the structure would promote the
general welfare of the city by encouraging study of American and local
history, architecture and design or by developing an understanding of the
importance and value of the American culture and heritage as well as by
making the city a more attractive and desirable place in which to live.



   (E)   Commission votes on certificate of demolition.  Following the
public hearing, the Quincy Preservation Commission shall vote to approve or
deny the certificate of demolition or to apply for a delay pursuant to
division (I) of this section.



   (F)   Applicant and Inspection Department informed of decision. 
The Secretary shall inform the applicant and the Inspection Department in
writing of the Quincy Preservation Commission’s decision within three
working days.



   (G)   Issuance of certificate of demolition.  Upon approval of an
application, the Secretary shall issue a certificate of demolition within
three working days and forward copies to the Inspection Department.



   (H)   Appeal from denial of certificate of demolition.  Upon denial
of an application, the applicant may appeal the decision as provided for in
§ 162.193.



   (I)   Alternatives.  Rather than deny or approve an application for
the certificate of demolition, the Quincy Preservation Commission may apply
to the City Council to delay or order a postponement of any demolition while
it investigates alternatives to granting a certificate and negotiate with the
property owner to find a means to prevent demolition. If after a reasonable
period of time, not in any case to exceed six months from the date of the
receipt of the application, no alternative agreement has been reached with
the applicant, the Quincy Preservation Commission shall issue a certificate
of demolition.



(1980 Code, § 29.1012)



§ 162.192  REVIEW AND COMMENT.



   The Quincy Preservation Commission shall also review and comment upon
proposed public improvement projects to be implemented by the city or any of
its departments or agencies. The Quincy Preservation Commission shall
consider the effect of the proposed project on the exterior architectural
appearance of nominated or designated Landmarks or of properties in a
Historic District, and may hold a public hearing to receive testimony from
property owners and the general public concerning the effect of the proposed
project on the historic or architectural character of the Landmark or
Historic District. The Quincy Preservation Commission shall report the
results or its consideration to appropriate city department and agencies and
to the City Council and make recommendations, if appropriate, for
modifications to the proposed project that will minimize its effect on a
Landmark or Historic District.



(1980 Code, § 29.1013)



§ 162.193  APPEALS.



   Any applicant denied a certificate of appropriateness or a certificate
of demolition may appeal the final decision of the Quincy Preservation
Commission to the Quincy City Council within 30 days. The City Council, after
reviewing the circumstances of the application and the reasons for the denial
may by resolution affirm the decision of the Quincy Preservation Commission
or order the Quincy Preservation Commission to issue a certificate. The
Secretary shall issue the certificate within five days after receipt of the
City Council order.

AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES



§ 162.240  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   The regulations imposed and the districts created under this subchapter
may be amended from time to time by ordinance.



(1980 Code, § 29.1201)



§ 162.241  PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Initiation of amendments.  Amendments may be proposed by the
Mayor and City Council, by the Zoning Board of Appeals, by the Plan
Commission, by any person having a proprietary interest (which shall include,
but not be limited to, the interest of an owner, beneficial owner, tenant,
contract purchaser or option holder) in the property affected by the
amendment, or by any interested citizen of the city.



   (B)   Application for amendment.  An application for an amendment
shall be filed with the City Clerk who shall forward a copy of the same to
the Plan Commission without delay. The application shall be filed in the
number of copies, be in the form, and contain information as the Secretary of
the Plan Commission may prescribe from time to time. If the application
pertains to amending the district map, the application shall be accompanied
by eight copies of a plat, drawn or pictured to an accurate scale by a person
competent therein, showing all pertinent information which pertinent
information shall include, at a minimum, the existing zoning and actual use
of the property involved and adjoining property as well as the general area
immediately affected by the proposed change. If the application pertains to
amending the provisions of this chapter, a proposed ordinance shall be
submitted. The Plan Commission shall conduct a public hearing thereon, to be
held within 60 days from the date of the receipt of the application by the
Secretary of the Plan Commission.



   (C)   Notice of hearing.  The Plan Commission shall cause to be
published public notice of the hearing on each proposed amendment at least
once, not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days before the hearing, in a
newspaper published within the city. The notice shall contain the date and
location of the public hearing, the subject property for which the amendment
is requested, a brief statement of the use for which the amendment is being
requested and shall state that every person in attendance at the hearing
shall have an opportunity to be heard, that every “interested party” (as
defined under § 162.001) shall have the right to cross-examine others at the
hearing, provided that the interested party enters his or her appearance with
the Department of Planning and Development no later than three business days
before the date of the public hearing. In addition to providing public notice
by publication, the Department shall post a sign at the subject property
advising the public of the requested action; the sign shall be posted not
less than 15 days prior to the public hearing.



   (D)   Notice to property owners.  If a change in the district map
is sought, the applicant shall not less than 15 days before the date of the
public hearing, serve written notice, either in person or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, on at least one owner of each
property within 250 feet in each direction of the lot line of the subject
property unless waived by the Plan Commission or City Council. Ownership
shall be based solely on the tax records of the county. The number of feet
occupied by all public roads, streets, alleys and other public ways shall be
excluded in computing the 250 foot requirement; provided further that in no
event shall this requirement exceed 400 feet, including public streets,
alleys and other public ways. The notice shall contain the same information
as is required under division (C) above for the public hearing notice, and
also shall include a statement of the use for which the change in the
district map is being sought. The notice shall be approved by the Director of
Planning and Development or his designee. If, after a bona fide effort to
determine the address by the applicant, the owner of the property on which
notice is served cannot be found at his, her or its last know address, or the
mailed notice is returned because the owner cannot be found at the last known
address, the notice requirements of these provisions shall be deemed
satisfied. Proof of giving notice hereof by affidavit shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Plan Commission. A failure to comply with the provisions of
this division shall not affect or invalidate any zoning amendment or change
and additionally may be waived by the City Council or Plan Commission.



   (E)   Review by the Plan Commission.  The proposed amendment or
change shall be reviewed by the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall
thereafter file a report with the City Council. The Plan Commission shall
have 60 days following the filing of the application or proposed amendment or
change to submit its report. If a report is not filed with the City Council
within 60 days, it may be assumed by the City Council that the Plan
Commission approved the application. The applicant for any change may,
however, agree to a longer time period than set forth herein.



   (F)   Continuation of hearing.  After notice of a scheduled hearing
has been published or served on adjoining property owners, as provided
herein, the hearing may be continued or withdrawn only upon approval of the
Plan Commission. A request by an applicant for continuation or withdrawal may
only be granted for good cause. Any request must be made in person to the
Plan Commission or in writing setting forth the reasons for the request.
Notwithstanding any request, the Plan Commission shall have the discretion
to  grant the request; deny the request and hold any required public hearing
and make a recommendation to the City Council regarding the subject
application; or grant a continuance and defer taking any final action, but
proceed with any required public hearing. In addition, and notwithstanding
the foregoing, if an applicant (who has otherwise failed to previously
request a continuation or withdrawal of an application) fails to appear at
the scheduled hearing, the application may be denied by the Plan Commission
with or without any required public hearing and the denial reported to the
City Council.



   (G)   Action by the City Council.  After receiving the
recommendations and report of the Plan Commission, the City Council may pass
the proposed amendment with or without change, may reject it, may recommit it
to the Plan Commission for further consideration, or take other appropriate
action. In case of a written protest against any proposed amendment of the
regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% of the
frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of 20% of the frontage
immediately adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of 20%
of the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, is
filed with the Clerk of the municipality, the amendment shall not be passed
except by a favorable vote of two-thirds of the Aldermen of the City Council
then holding office. In these cases, a copy of the written protect shall be
served by the protestor or protestors on the applicant for the proposed
amendment and a copy upon the applicant’s attorney, if any, by certified
mail at the address of the applicant and attorney shown in the application
for the proposed amendment.



   (H)   Amendment of application.  A proposed amendment or change to
the terms of this subchapter may be amended from time to time as the City
Council, Plan Commission or other appropriate party may desire. A proposed
amendment or change in the district map may also be amended at any time by
the applicant subject to the condition that the publication and notice
requirements herein established are again complied with. It shall not,
however, be necessary to again comply with the publication and notice
requirement, herein established if the application for amendment or change to
the district map is to a zoning classification which is included within the
zoning classification sought and relative to which the publication and notice
requirements herein established have been complied with. Thus, for example,
an application for a C2 District may be amended to an application for RS,
R1A, R1B, R1C, R2, R3, C1A or C1B District as the uses in the zoning
classifications are included within the general C2 zoning classification of
permitted uses.



   (I)   Alternate and cumulative applications.  Nothing herein shall
prevent a person from applying for alternate changes in zoning
classifications or a change in zoning classification and/or a special permit.
If the publication and notice requirements herein established have been
complied with, the Plan Commission may recommend amendments, changes or
special permits subject to the City Council’s approval of appropriate
amendments, changes or special permits.



   (J)   Effect of denial of zoning change.  After a public hearing
has been held and a zoning change denied in whole or part by the City
Council, an application for the same shall not be resubmitted for a period of
one year from the date of the denial, unless allowed by the City Council. In
general, resubmission shall be allowed only if there is substantial new
evidence or proof of changed conditions found to warrant resubmission.

   Except in those cases where a zoning map amendment is requested by the
city, a fee of $300 shall be paid to the city to defray the cost of the
administration, publishing, posting notices of the proposed amendment and the
cost of maintaining a record of the public hearing. The fee shall be paid to
the Department of Planning and Development.

hereof shall be so interpreted as authorizing any use or condition

be unlawful under the provisions of this subchapter or any amendment or
change hereof.
