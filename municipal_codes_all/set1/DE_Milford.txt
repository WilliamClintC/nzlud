PREFACE 
    Beginning with Supplement 14, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of General Code Publishers Corp. 
    The City of Milford has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative change common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the city, subsequent growth of the community, together with the complexity of modern life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the city. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the City Council ordered the following codification of the city's legislation. 
Contents of Code 
    The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the City Council of the City of Milford, including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the City Council in the course of the codification. 
Division of Code 
    The Code is divided into two major divisions. The first division includes the Charter of the city. The second division includes all legislation of a general and permanent nature as Parts I and II. Part I, Administrative Legislation, contains all city legislation of an administrative nature, such as that dealing with the administration of government, that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments. Part II, General Legislation, contains all other city legislation of a regulatory nature. Items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions, whereas those in Part I do not. 
Grouping of Legislation and Arrangement of Chapters 
    The various items of legislation are organized into chapters, their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another. Wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a single chapter. Thus, for example, all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in Part II, in the chapter entitled "Streets and Sidewalks." In such chapters, use of article or part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation. 
Table of Contents 
    The Table of Contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter, titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate the location of the individual item of legislation. 
Reserved Chapters 
    Space has been provided in the Code for the convenient insertion, alphabetically, of later enactments. In the Table of Contents such space appears as chapters entitled "(Reserved)." In the body of the Code, reserved space is provided by breaks in the page-numbering sequence between chapters. 
Pagination 
    A unique page-numbering system has been used, in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit. One hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter, and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals "01." Thus, Chapter 6 begins on page 6:01, Chapter 53 on page 53:01, etc. By use of this system, it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters, and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization. 
Numbering of Sections 
    A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed, in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 is 6-1, while the fourth section of Chapter 53 is 53-4. New sections can then be added between existing sections using a decimal system. Thus, for example, if two sections were to be added between 53-4 and 53-5, they would be numbered as 53-4.1 and 53-4.2. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: [Ord. No. 272 § 1, 1992] .) 
Codification 
Amendments and Revisions 
    New chapters adopted during the process of codification are specifically enumerated in chapter Histories with reference to "Ch. 1, General Provisions," where the legislation adopting this Code and making such revisions will appear after final enactment. Sections amended or revised are indicated in the text by means of Editor's Notes referring to the chapter cited above. 
General References; Editor's Notes 
    Editor's notes and cross references are used in the text to provide supplementary information. For example, editor's notes are used to indicate when a chapter, article or section has been repealed or replaced. Cross-references indicate related provisions in other chapters. 
Appendix 
    Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of the Code but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government. The Appendix of this Code is reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include. 
Disposition List 
    The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation adopted since the publication of the Code, indicating its inclusion in the Code or the reason for its exclusion. The Disposition List will be updated with each supplement to the Code to include the legislation reviewed with said supplement. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 14, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 14, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
CITY PLANNING COMMISSION 
Administrative departments, C7.08 
Appointments, C7.08 
Membership, C7.08 
Powers and duties, C7.08 
Terms of office, C7.08 
See also PLANNING COMMISSION 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instructions for 
Amending the Code 
    All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or complete new additions, should be adopted as amending the Code. In doing so, existing material that is not being substantively altered should not be renumbered. Where new sections are to be added to a chapter, they can be added at the end of the existing material (continuing the numbering sequence) or inserted between existing sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a new section between 45-5 and 45-6 should be designated 45-5.1). New chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence in the appropriate division or part (e.g., Part I, Administrative Legislation, or Part II, General Legislation), utilizing the reserved chapter numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word for the alphabetical listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles, Abandoned" under "V" in the table of contents, and a new enactment on coin-operated amusement devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement Devices, Coin-Operated" under "A" in the table of contents). Where a reserved number is not available, an "A" chapter should be used (e.g., a new chapter to be included between Chapters 45 and 46 should be designated Chapter 45A). New articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter (e.g., adding a new district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use of "A" articles (e.g., a new article to be included between Articles XVI and XVII should be designated Article XVIA). The section numbers would be as indicated above (e.g., if the new Article XVIA contains six sections and existing Article XVI ends with 45-30 and Article XVII begins with 45-31, Article XVIA should contain 45-30.1 through 45-30.6). 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the latest ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be removed from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

1.04 - Annexation. 
    The City may from time to time extend its boundaries through the process of annexation in accordance with the Delaware Code and the following procedures shall apply: 
(a)  All the property owners of the territory contiguous to the then existing corporate limits and territory of the City of Milford, by written Petition with the signature of each such Petitioner duly witnessed, may request the City Council to annex that certain territory in which they own property. 
(1)  The petition presented to the City Council shall include the tax parcel number(s), a description of the territory requested to be annexed in electronic format, a sealed survey (dated within 1 year of the petition), present and requested zoning, a statement of compliance with the Comprehensive Plan and the reasons for the requested annexation. 
(2)  If the Planning Director deems the petition complete, the petition shall be provided to the Mayor and City Council to be referred to the Annexation Committee. If the Annexation Committee is not duly constituted, the Mayor of the City of Milford shall appoint a Committee composed of not less than 3 of the elected members of the City Council and one member of the City Planning Commission to investigate the possibility of annexation. Not later than 90 days following referral of the petition to the Annexation Committee by the City Council the Committee shall submit a written report containing its findings and conclusions to the Mayor and City Council of Milford. The report so submitted shall include the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed annexation, both to the City of Milford and to the territory proposed to be annexed, and shall contain the recommendation of the Committee whether or not to proceed with the proposed annexation and the reasons therefore, as well as a recommended zoning district for the property to be annexed. 
(3)  A Plan of Services for the property must be completed in accordance with Delaware Code. This Plan of Services must be completed for review and acceptance by all necessary agencies prior to final legislative action on the annexation. 
(4)  The annexation petition and zoning application shall also be referred to the Planning Commission for a Public Hearing and review and recommendation to City Council. Within 60 days of the final recommendation by the Planning Commission, City Council shall hold a public hearing to consider the annexation petition and zoning application. 
(5)  Following the public hearing on the proposed annexation petition and subject to the acceptance of the Plan of Services, City Council may then adopt an ordinance annexing such territory to the City of Milford. Such ordinance shall be passed by the affirmative vote of 2/3 of all the elected members of the City Council. If the ordinance fails to receive the affirmative vote of 2/3 of the elected members of the City Council, the territory proposed to be annexed shall not again be considered for annexation for a period of 6 months from the date that the resolution failed to receive the required affirmative vote. The concurrent zoning application shall be considered for adoption by City Council in accordance with the provisions set forth hereafter and in this Charter and the Code of the City of Milford. 
(6)  The public notice of the annexation ordinance shall contain a description of the territory proposed to be annexed, requested zoning and shall fix a time and place for a public hearing on the subject of the proposed annexation and zoning. The public notice of the annexation ordinance shall be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the City of Milford at least 1 week prior to the date set for the public hearing, or, at the discretion of the City Council, the said notice shall be posted in 2 public places both in the City of Milford and in the territory proposed to be annexed and the City website. 
(7)  If the ordinance receives a favorable vote for annexation, the City Council shall cause a description and a plot of the territory so annexed to be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in and for the county in which the property is located, but in no event, shall said recordation be completed more than 90 days following the date of the favorable vote for annexation by the City Council. The territory considered for annexation shall be considered to be a part of the City of Milford from the time of recordation. The failure to record the description of the plot within a specified time shall not make the annexation invalid, but such annexation shall be deemed to be effective at the expiration of the 90 day period from the date of the favorable vote of the City Council. 
(b)  If 5 or more property owners, but less than all of the property owners of a territory contiguous to the then limits and territory of the City of Milford, by written Petition with the signature of each such Petitioner duly witnessed, shall request the City Council to annex that certain territory in which they own property. 
(1)  The procedure for consideration of a petition under Section 1.04(b) of this Charter shall be the same as the procedure under Section 1.04(1)(1 through 7), unless otherwise stated. 
(2)  The ordinance adopted under the procedures of Section 1.04 (a) (1 through 7) of this Charter applicable to petitions filed under Section 1.04(b) shall be subject to the approval of the property owners in the territory to be annexed. Said approval or disapproval shall be signified at a Special Election as set forth hereafter. 
(3)  In the event that the ordinance for annexation does not receive an affirmative vote by 2/3 of all the elected members of the City Council, no Special Election shall be held and the territory previously proposed to be annexed shall not again be considered for annexation for a period of 6 months from the date the ordinance failed to receive the required affirmative vote. 
(4)  Following the affirmative vote but in no event later than 30 days after said ordinance has been adopted, the City Council shall order a Special Election to be held not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after said affirmative ordinance was adopted by City Council. 
(5)  The notice of the time and place of the said Special Election shall be published within 30 days immediately preceding the date of this Special Election in at least 2 issues of a newspaper having a general circulation in the City of Milford, or, at the discretion of the City Council, the said notice may be posted in 2 public places, in the City of Milford, in the territory proposed to be annexed, and on the City website at least 15 days prior to the date set forth for the said Special Election. 
(6)  At the Special Election, each person who has an ownership interest in a property in the territory proposed to be annexed shall have 1 vote and every partnership, corporation, company, or other legally created artificial entity in the territory proposed to be annexed which has an ownership interest in a property in the territory proposed to be annexed shall have 1 vote. Property held by a partnership or by a corporation shall vote only by a power of attorney, corporate resolution, or authorization affidavit duly executed. In the event that an individual holds a Power of Attorney or corporate resolution duly executed and acknowledged, specifically authorizing the said individual to vote on behalf of a partnership or by a corporation at the said Special Election, before that person votes, a duly authenticated Power of Attorney or corporate resolution, shall be filed in the Office of the City Manager of the City of Milford. Said Power of Attorney or corporate resolution so filed shall constitute conclusive evidence of the right of said person to vote in the Special Election for such partnership or for such corporation. Property owners, individuals, or entities in the area proposed to be annexed shall have only 1 vote regardless of the number of parcels owned. 
(7)  The City Council of the City of Milford may cause either voting machines or paper ballots to be used in the Special Election, the form of the ballot to be printed as follows:

Voting shall be conducted in a public place as designated by the ordinance calling the Special Election. The polling place shall be open from 10:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on the date set for the Special Election or until all those entitled to vote have done so. All persons in the polling place at the time of the closing of the polls shall be permitted to vote, even though such votes are not cast until after the time for the closing of the polls. 
(9)  Immediately upon the closing of the polling place, the Board of Special Election shall count the ballots for and against the proposed annexation and shall announce the result thereof. The Board of Special Election shall make a Certificate under their hands of the votes cast for and against the proposed annexation and the number of void votes and shall deliver the same to the City Council. Said Certificate shall be filed with the papers of the City Council. In order for the territory proposed to be annexed to be considered annexed, a majority of the votes cast from the territory proposed to be annexed must have been cast in favor of the proposed annexation. 
(10)  In the event that the Special Election results in an unfavorable vote for annexation, no part of the territory considered at the Special Election for annexation shall again be considered for annexation for a period of at least 6 months from the date of the said Special Election. 
(11)  If a favorable vote for annexation shall have been cast, the City Council of the City of Milford shall cause a description and a plot of the territory so annexed to be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds, in and for the county in which the property is located, but in no event shall said recordation be completed more than 90 days following the date of the said Special Election. The territory considered for annexation shall be considered to be part of the City of Milford from the time of recordation. The failure to record the description or the plat within the specified time shall not make the annexation invalid, but such annexation shall be deemed to be effective at the expiration of the 90 day period from the date of the favorable Special Election. 
(c)  Annexation Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, where, pursuant to §1.04(a) or (b) of this Charter, annexation proceedings are initiated by a property owner(s) holding record title to real property in territory contiguous to the then existing corporate limits of the City, such petition may be made contingent upon an annexation agreement with the City which agreement may address any matters which would be relevant to the subject lands, if annexed. By way of example and not in limitation, such agreement may address zoning, subdivision approval, tax relief, public utilities and public improvements. In the event the City Council approves such an agreement and votes to accept a petition under this §1.04 of this Charter, such Annexation Agreement shall be deemed a material part of the annexation and shall be included in all subsequent steps of the annexation procedure. City Council may vote to require the Annexation Agreement at any time before adoption of the ordinance annexing the territory into the city. 
The ordinances and notices adopted by the City Council shall recite that the proposed annexation includes and is subject to an annexation agreement. The ordinances and ballots, if an election is required, annexing the territory shall recite that the annexation is subject to an annexation agreement and shall incorporate the terms of such agreement by specific reference. An annexation agreement may be modified or amended by mutual agreement of the petitioner and the City Council at any time prior to the ordinance adopted by City Council annexing the land into the City of Milford. In any event, the Annexation Agreement shall run with the land and be recorded with the annexation ordinance.

[HISTORY: Adopted by the City Council of the City of Milford 6-9-1997. Amendments noted where applicable.] 
GENERAL REFERENCES 
Teen centers - See Ch. 208. 

§ 111-1. - Definitions and word usage. 
A.  For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein: 
CITY - The City of Milford, Delaware, with administrative offices at 201 South Walnut Street, Milford, Delaware. 
EMERGENCY - An unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action. The term includes, but is not limited to, a fire, natural disaster or automobile accident or any situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life. 
ESTABLISHMENT - Any privately owned place of business operated for a profit to which the public is invited, including but not limited to any place of amusement or entertainment. 
JUVENILE or MINOR - Any unemancipated person under the age of 17 or, in equivalent phrasing often herein employed, any person 16 or fewer years of age. 
OPERATOR - Any individual, firm, association, partnership or corporation operating, managing or conducting any establishment. The term includes the members or partners of an association or partnership and the officers of a corporation. 
PARENT - Any person having legal custody of a juvenile: 
(1)  As a natural or adoptive parent. 
(2)  As a legal guardian. 
(3)  As a person who stands in loco parentis. 
(4)  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by court order. 
PUBLIC PLACE - Any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, common areas of schools, shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, transportation facilities, theaters, restaurants, shops, bowling alleys, taverns, cafes, arcades and similar areas that are open to the use of the public. As a type of public place, a street is a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or, in the case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. "Street" includes that legal right-of-way, including but not limited to the cartway of traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. 
REMAIN - To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily in a public place, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any juvenile involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home, or to fail to leave the premises of an establishment when requested to do so by a police officer or the operator of an establishment. To implement this provision with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in this chapter. More and more exceptions become available with a juvenile's increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation. 
TIME OF NIGHT - Based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern standard time or Eastern daylight savings time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city, prima facie the time then observed in the city administrative offices and police station. 
YEARS OF AGE - Continues from one birthday, such as the 16th, to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the 17th birthday, making it clear that 16 or fewer years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 17 years of age," the latter phrase in practice, unfortunately, having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that 17 years old might be involved. Similarly, for example, 11 or fewer years of age means "under 12 years of age." 
B.  When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular, and words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory. 
§ 111-2. - Curfew established. 
A.  School year curfew. It shall be unlawful for any person 16 years or fewer of age (under 17) to be or remain in or upon a public place within the City of Milford during the Milford School District designated school year for the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning: 
(1)  At 12:00 midnight on Friday and Saturday nights; and 
(2)  At 11:00 p.m. on all other nights. 
B.  Summer curfew. It shall be unlawful for any person 16 years or fewer of age (under 17) to be or remain in or upon a public place within the City of Milford during the Milford School District designated summer break for the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning: 
(1)  At 1:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights; and 
(2)  At 12:00 midnight on all other nights. 
§ 111-3. - Exceptions. 
A.  The following shall constitute valid exceptions to the operation of this chapter: 
(1)  Accompanied by parent. When a juvenile is accompanied by a parent of such juvenile. 
(2)  Accompanied by authorized adult. When a juvenile is accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such juvenile to take said parent's place in accompanying said juvenile for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area. 
(3)  Errand directed, in writing, by parent. When the juvenile is on an errand as directed by his/her parent, provided that such juvenile shall have on his/her person a written note, signed by the juvenile's parent, stating: 
(a)  The date and time that the note was written (which shall be not more than 24 hours before the time of the errand); 
(b)  The name of the juvenile; 
(c)  The name, address and telephone number of the parent; and 
(d)  The specific errand directed by the parent. 
(4)  Emergency. When a juvenile is assisting in an emergency, including, by way of example and not in limitation, responding as a member of a volunteer fire company to a fire company or paramedic call. 
(5)  First amendment rights. When a juvenile is exercising first amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly, by first delivering to the person designated by the city's Chief of Police to receive such information a written communication, signed by the juvenile and countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of the juvenile, with his or her home address and telephone number, specifying when, where and in what manner the juvenile will be in a public place during hours when this chapter is applicable to said minor in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication. 
(6)  Reasonable necessity. In case of reasonable necessity for the juvenile remaining in a public place, but only after the juvenile's parent has communicated to the Chief of Police or the person designated by the Chief of Police to receive such notifications the facts establishing the reasonable necessity relating to a specified public place at a designated time for a described purpose, including points of origin and destination. A copy of the communication, or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and addresses of the parent and juvenile, shall be admissible evidence. 
(7)  On own or neighbor's property. When a juvenile is on the sidewalk or property where the juvenile resides, or on either side of or across the street from the place where the juvenile resides, and the adult owner or resident of that property has given permission for the juvenile to be there. 
(8)  Returning home within one hour of official activity. When a juvenile is returning home from, and within one hour from, the termination or closing of an official school, religious or other recreational activity supervised by adults, sponsored by the City of Milford, a recognized charitable, benevolent or civic association or a similar entity that takes responsibility for the minor. 
(9)  Special permit (individual). When authorized by special permit from the Chief of Police carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized, as follows: 
(a)  When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter, then recourse may be had to the Chief of Police, either for a regulation as provided in Subsection A(10) or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. 
(b)  Upon a finding of undue hardship and reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile and by a parent of the juvenile, if feasible, stating: the name, age and address of the juvenile; the name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof; the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the juvenile; the necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public place during the curfew hours otherwise applicable and the undue hardship that will result if such permit is not granted; the public place; and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved, by date and hour, the Chief of Police may grant a permit, in writing, for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the opinion of the Chief of Police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purposes of this chapter. In an emergency, this may be handled by prior telephone or other effective communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously by the Chief of Police or by the person designated by the Chief of Police to act on his or her behalf in an emergency at the police station. 
(10)  Special regulation (group). When authorized by regulation issued by the Chief of Police in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to reasonably necessary nighttime activities of more juveniles than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis, but only where such juveniles will be under the active supervision of adults responsible for such juveniles. Normally such regulation by the Chief of Police permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies, such as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the public places permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more than one hour beyond the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
(11)  Employment necessity. When the juvenile is legally employed, going to or returning home from employment, and carries a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the parent and employer and briefly identifying the juvenile, the addresses and telephone numbers of the juvenile's home and of the juvenile's place of employment and the juvenile's hours of employment. The city shall prepare a form to be used by employers for purposes of this subsection. 1 [] 
(12)  Interstate or intrastate travel. When the juvenile is, with parental consent, engaged in normal interstate or intrastate travel through the city or originating or terminating in the city. 
(13)  Married. When the juvenile is married or has been married pursuant to state law. 
(14)  Operator of establishment. In the case of an operator of an establishment, when the operator has notified the police that a juvenile was present on the premises of the establishment during curfew hours and refused to leave. 
B.  Continuing consideration of exceptions. Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations, such as provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized, and will be considered by Council when warranted by future experience.

§ 111-4. - Parental responsibility. 
A.  The foregoing exceptions to the operation of this chapter shall act only to create a waiver of enforcement and affirmative defense(s) to such enforcement. By authorizing such exceptions, neither the city nor any member of the Police Department shall assume any affirmative obligation or duty to supervise the well-being of any juvenile acting pursuant to such authorized exception. 
B.  It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a juvenile knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow the juvenile to remain in any city public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this chapter. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile. 
C.  It shall be unlawful for any parent to knowingly (as defined above) provide any false authorization, information or certification, written or verbal, to the Milford Police Department in order to obtain an exception to the operation of this chapter under § 111-3 hereof. 
§ 111-5. - Operator responsibility. 
It shall be unlawful for any operator of an establishment to knowingly permit a juvenile to remain at the establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this chapter. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an operator should reasonably be expected to have concerning the patrons of the establishment. The standard for "knowingly" shall be applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's position should have known that the patron was a juvenile in violation of this chapter. 
§ 111-6. - Enforcement. 
A.  If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is in a public place in violation of this chapter, the officer shall notify the juvenile that he or she is in violation of this chapter and shall require the juvenile to provide his or her name, address and telephone number and how to contact his or her parent or guardian. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate, a police officer shall, in the first instance of violation of the chapter, use his or her best judgment in determining age. 
B.  The police officer shall issue the juvenile a written warning that the juvenile is in violation of this chapter and order the juvenile to go promptly home. The Chief of Police shall send the parent or guardian of the juvenile written notice of the violation pursuant to § 111-4. 
C.  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent or guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances; for example, a juvenile of tender age, near home, whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are known. 
D.  Notwithstanding Subsection B of this section, when a juvenile has received one previous written warning for violation of this chapter or a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has engaged in delinquent conduct, the procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the police station where a parent or guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the juvenile, whereupon the parent or guardian and the juvenile shall be questioned. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts and to centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making available experienced personnel and access to information and records. 
E.  When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take charge of the juvenile and the appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that, in accordance with police regulations approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an adult, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent or guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian. 
F.  In the case of a first violation of this chapter by a juvenile, the Chief of Police shall, by certified mail, send to a parent or guardian written notice of the violation, with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
G.  For the first violation of this chapter by an operator of an establishment who permits a juvenile to remain on the premises, a police officer shall issue a written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the chapter, including enforcement of operator responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
H.  In any event the police officer shall, within 24 hours, file a written report with the Chief of Police or shall participate, to the extent of the information for which he or she is responsible, in the preparation of a report on the curfew violation. It is not the intention of this section to require extensive reports that will prevent police officers from performing their primary police duties. The reports shall be as simple as is reasonably possible and may be completed by Police Departmental personnel other than sworn police officers. 
§ 111-7. - Violations and penalties. 
A.  Parents. 
(1)  If, after the warning notice pursuant to § 111-6 of a first violation by a juvenile, a parent violates § 111-4 (in connection with a second violation by the juvenile), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent. For the first offense by a parent, the fine shall be $50, and for each subsequent offense by a parent the fine shall be increased by an additional $20: e.g., $70 for the second offense and $90 for the third offense. Any court of competent jurisdiction, upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent to pay this fine and the cost of prosecution. 
(2)  The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for all costs incurred by the City of Milford for providing personnel to remain in the company of a juvenile who has been detained as a curfew violator if the parent or guardian does not pick up the juvenile within one hour after receiving notice from the city that the city is detaining the juvenile for a curfew violation. The amount to be paid by the parent or guardian shall be based on the hourly wage of the city employee who is assigned to remain with the juvenile plus the cost of benefits for that employee. 
(3)  The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for any fine or condition of restitution or reparation imposed by a court upon a curfew violator, provided that the curfew violator has not paid the fine or made restitution or reparation within the time ordered by the court and further provided that the parent or legal guardian has been made a party defendant in all enforcement proceedings against the curfew violator and shall be served with all citations, summons, complaints, notices and other documents required to be served on the curfew violator defendant. 
B.  Juveniles. Any juvenile who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter more than three times shall be reported by the Chief of Police to the juvenile authorities as a juvenile in need of supervision, and the Chief of Police may proceed to file such charges with the courts as he or she may deem appropriate. 
C.  Operators. If, after the warning notice pursuant to § 111-6 of a violation of this chapter, an operator of an establishment violates § 111-5 a second time, this shall be treated as a first offense by the operator. For the first offense by an operator, the fine shall be $50, and for each subsequent offense by an operator the fine shall be increased by an additional $20: e.g., $70 for the second offense and $90 for the third offense. 
D.  False certification. Any parent convicted of knowingly providing any false authorization, information or certification, written or verbal, to the Milford Police Department in violation of § 111-4C shall forfeit and pay a fine of $50 for the first offense, and for each subsequent offense the fine shall be increased by an additional $20, plus costs. 
§ 111-8. - Advisory opinions. 
The City Manager, after consultation with the City Attorney, is hereby authorized to give advisory opinions, in writing, which shall be binding and shall be adhered to by the police until the chapter is amended in such respect, interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions. Normally such advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed letters addressed to the City Manager or to a member of the City Council questioning this chapter as ambiguous, having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights specifically invoked or otherwise invalid, in all three categories with respect to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative remedy must be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in any of the three categories. The City Council does not intend a result through the enforcement of this chapter that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable. Council intends that the chapter be held inapplicable in such cases if anywhere its application would be unconstitutional under the Constitution of the State of Delaware or the Constitution of the United States of America. 
§ 111-9. - Continuing evaluation. 
The City Council shall continue its evaluation and updating of this chapter through methods including but not limited to the following: 
A.  Within six months after the implementation of this chapter, the Chief of Police shall provide the City Council with a report concerning the effect of this chapter on crimes committed by and against minors and of the number of warnings issued and arrests of minors, parents and operators hereunder and such other information as Council may request. 
B.  On a regular basis, the City Council shall receive informal reports of all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity, the notices of school and other activities, the special permits and the regulations authorized above and the advisory opinions for consideration by the Council in further updating and continuing evaluation of this chapter. 
§ 111-10. - Notice. 
Notice of the existence of this chapter and of the curfew regulations established by it shall be posted in, on or about such public or quasi-public places as may be determined by the Chief Executive or the Police Department in order that the public may be constantly informed of the existence of this chapter and its regulations.

Chapter 130 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, adopted Jan. 26, 2015, repealed the former ch. 130, §§ 130-1-130-27, and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former Ch. 130 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted Sept. 14, 1992. 
Cross reference- Building construction, ch. 88; subdivision of land, ch. 200; zoning, ch. 230. 

ARTICLE I - General Provisions 

§ 130-1. - Findings. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified special flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the City of Milford. Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Development that is inadequately elevated, improperly floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contributes to the flood loss. 
The City of Milford, by resolution, agreed to meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for participation in the program on June 1, 1977. Subsequent to that date or the initial effective date of the City of Milford Flood Insurance Rate Map, all development and new construction as defined herein, are to be compliant with the City of Milford's floodplain management regulations in effect at the time of construction, and all development, new construction, and substantial improvements subsequent to the effective date of these regulations shall be compliant with these regulations. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015] 
§ 130-2. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to: 
(A)  Protect human life, health and welfare; 
(B)  Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future; 
(C)  Minimize flooding of water supply and sanitary sewage disposal systems; 
(D)  Maintain natural drainage; 
(E)  Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units and its residents, by discouraging unwise design and construction of development in areas subject to flooding; 
(F)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(G)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(H)  Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges; 
(I)  Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions; 
(J)  Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near floodprone areas; 
(K)  Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain are maintained; 
(L)  Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(M)  Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and 
(N)  Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 C.F.R. Section 59.22. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015] 
§ 130-3. - Areas to which these regulations apply. 
These regulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Milford, as identified in § 130-4. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015] 
§ 130-4. - Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas. 
For the purposes of these regulations, the following are adopted by reference as a part of these regulations and serve as the basis for establishing special flood hazard areas: 
(A)  The FEMA Flood Insurance Study for Sussex County, Delaware and Incorporated Areas dated March 16, 2015 and all subsequent amendments and/or the most recent revision thereof. 
(B)  The FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map for Sussex County, Delaware and Incorporated Areas dated March 16, 2015, and all subsequent amendments and/or the most recent revision thereof. 
(C)  Other hydrologic and hydraulic engineering studies and/or maps prepared pursuant to these regulations or for other purposes, and which establish base flood elevations, delineate 100-year floodplains, floodways or other areas of special flood hazard. 
(D)  The City of Milford may identify and regulate new local flood hazard or ponding areas. These areas should be delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies. 
(E)  Where field surveyed topography indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a flood hazard map, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area. 
Maps and studies that establish special flood hazard areas are on file at the City of Milford Planning Department. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2018-25, § 2, 11-26-2018] 
§ 130-5. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by these regulations. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015] 
§ 130-6. - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions shall be: 
(A)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(B)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; 
(C)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes; and 
(D)  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence, where more restrictive. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015] 
§ 130-7. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Milford, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015] 
§ 130-8. - Severability. 
Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
[Ord. No. 2014-16, §§ 1, 2, 1-26-2015] 
ARTICLE II - Definitions 

§ 130-9. - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application. 
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure. 
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated Zone AO on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map with a one percent annual chance or greater of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; the base flood also is referred to as the 100-year flood (or the 1%-annual-chance flood). 
BASE FLOOD DISCHARGE: The volume of water resulting from a Base Flood as it passes a given location within a given time, usually expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs). 
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION: The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the datum specified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map. In areas of shallow flooding, the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number specified in feet on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, or at least 2 feet if the depth number is not specified. 
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, placement of manufactured homes, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
DRY FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: The National Flood Insurance Program, Elevation Certificate (FEMA Form 086-0-33), used to document building elevations and other information about buildings. When required to be certified, the form shall be completed by a licensed professional land surveyor. 
ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR: An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement. 
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA): The federal agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program. 
FEMA TECHNICAL BULLETIN: A series of guidance documents published by FEMA to provide guidance concerning building performance standards of the National Flood Insurance Program. See sections where specific TBs are identified. 
FLOOD OR FLOODING: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
FLOOD DAMAGE-RESISTANT MATERIALS: Any construction material capable of withstanding direct and prolonged contact with floodwaters without sustaining any damage that requires more than cosmetic repair. See FEMA Technical Bulletin #2 - Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements and FEMA Technical Bulletin #8 - Corrosion Protection for Metal Connectors in Coastal Areas. 
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated special flood hazard areas to indicate the magnitude and nature of flood hazards, and to designate applicable flood zones. 
ZONE A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 1% annual chance flood; base flood elevations are not determined. 
ZONE AE: Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood; base flood elevations are determined; floodways may or may not be determined. 
ZONE AO: Areas of shallow flooding, with or without a designated average flood depth. 
ZONE X (shaded): Areas subject to inundation by the 500-year flood (0.2% annual chance); areas subject to the 1% annual chance flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood. 
ZONE X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 1% annual chance flood and outside the 500-year floodplain. 
ZONE VE: Special flood hazard areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood and subject to high velocity wave action (also referred to as coastal high hazard areas). 
LIMIT OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION (LiMWA): The inland limit of the area affected by waves greater than 1.5 feet during the base flood. Base flood conditions between the Zone VE and the LiMWA will be similar to, but less severe than, those in the Zone VE. 
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway information, and the water surface elevations. 
FLOODPLAIN: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see "Flood" or "Flooding"). 
FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE: The National Flood Insurance Program, Floodproofing Certificate for Non-Residential Structures (FEMA Form 86-0-34), used by registered professional engineers and architects to certify dry floodproofing designs. 
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. 
FREEBOARD: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood elevation for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed. 
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water; the term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is: 
(1)  Individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; or 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district. 
HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS: An analysis performed by a professional engineer, licensed in the State of Delaware, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood profiles. 
LETTER OF MAP CHANGE: A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map, Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and Flood Insurance Study. Letters of Map Change include: 
LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA): An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was inadvertently included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood; in order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with these regulations. 
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies; upon submission to and approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued. 
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest floor. 
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
NEW CONSTRUCTION: Buildings and structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after June 1, 1977, including any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
PERSON: An individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and agencies. 
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA: The land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, and Zone VE. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically listed or otherwise described in § 130-4. 
START OF CONSTRUCTION: The date of issuance of permits for new construction and substantial improvements, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory structures, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
STRUCTURE (OR BUILDING): For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the Elevation Certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in these regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE VI - Variances 

§ 130-31. - Variances. 
The City of Milford's Board of Adjustment shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the requirements of these regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. 
(A)  Application for a Variance. 
(1)  Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is sought shall submit an application for a variance to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(2)  At a minimum, such application shall contain the following information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use; description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the variance sought; and reason for the variance request. Each variance application shall specifically address each of the considerations in § 130-31(B) and the limitations and conditions of § 130-31(C). 
(B)  Considerations for Variances. In considering variance applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, requirements specified in other sections of these regulations, and the following factors: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others. 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage. 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents (if applicable) to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community. 
(5)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to, or are subject to less, flooding or erosion damage. 
(6)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable, or if the facility is a functionally dependent use. 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development. 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan for that area. 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site. 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(C)  Limitations for Variances 
(1)  An affirmative decision on a variance request shall only be issued upon: 
(a)  A showing of good and sufficient cause. A "good and sufficient" cause is one that deals solely with the physical characteristics of the property and cannot be based on the character of the planned construction or substantial improvement, the personal characteristics of the owner or inhabitants, or local provisions that regulate standards other than health and public safety standards. 
(b)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. 
(c)  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
(d)  A determination that the granting of a variance for development within any designated floodway, or special flood hazard area with base flood elevations but no floodway, will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations. 
(e)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws. 
(f)  A determination that the structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages. 
(g)  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Upon consideration of the individual circumstances, the limitations and conditions, and the purposes of these regulations, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. 
(3)  The Board of Adjustment shall notify, in writing, any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building or structure with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation plus 18 inches that the variance is to the floodplain management requirements of these regulations only, and that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk.

[Ord. No. 2019-02, § 3, 3-11-2019] 
§ 185-4. - Methods of measuring volume and concentration. 
A.  Whenever a person purchases water from the City of Milford and all water used upon the premises discharges sanitary sewage or industrial wastes into the City sewer system, the volume of water purchased shall be deemed to be the volume of the sewage or wastes discharged into the City sewer system. 
B.  Whenever a person purchasing water from the City of Milford and discharging sanitary sewage or industrial waste into the City sewer system also discharges unpolluted cooling water to either a separate storm sewer or other outlet, an allowance for the amount of water so discharged shall be made in computing the sewer charges. The person so discharging cooling water shall, at his own expense, install a meter or meters, as required, to indicate accurately to the satisfaction of the City the amount of water claimed as a credit. 
C.  Whenever a person using a private water supply discharges sanitary sewage or industrial wastes to the City sewer system, the charges for such discharge shall be in accordance with the schedule of rates set forth in Article II. Such person, however, either shall install, at his expense, a water meter or meters as may be required to measure the total volume of water used on the premises or shall install, at his expense, a meter on the sewer line leaving the premises so as to measure the entire flow of waste discharged to the City sewer system. 
(1)  No meter for measurement either of the water or sewage shall be installed until a plan for such installation is submitted to the City and approved as satisfactory. All meters or other measuring devices installed or required to be used under the provision of this article shall be under the control of the City. 
(2)  The owner of the property upon which such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made at the owner's expense whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary wear and tear, or other causes. The bill for such repairs, if made by the City of Milford, shall be due and payable at the same time and collected in the same manner as are the bills for sewer services. Such bills, from and after their due date, shall constitute a lien upon the real estate served by these facilities and shall have the same priority and superiority as the general tax lien of the City. 
D.  The City shall be responsible for the reading of water and/or sewage meters when installed. Where, in the opinion of the City, it is not necessary to install a meter, measurements of the discharge to the sewer shall be made quarterly by the City, and the measurements so made shall be used for determining the sewer charge for that quarter. Any person dissatisfied with the sewer rate so determined may, at his own cost, install a meter or meters as provided by Subsection C.

B.  The analysis of samples shall be made in accordance with the latest edition of the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage as published by the American Public Health Association. 
C.  When required by the City, the owner of any property discharging industrial waste to the City sewer system shall install a suitable control manhole in the sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the waste. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City. The manhole shall be installed by the owner, at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
D.  The City and/or its duly authorized representatives shall at all reasonable times be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing, in accordance with the provisions of this article.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2017-07, § 3, adopted Feb. 13, 2017, repealed § 185-25, and § 4 of the ordinance redesignated the former § 185-26 as a new § 185-25 to read as set out herein. The former § 185-25 pertained to computation of impact fee and derived from Ord. No. 2015-22, § 2, adopted Nov. 23, 2015. 
§ 185-26. - Multiple property owners/developer public works agreement and aid-in-construction. 
A.  In a case where multiple developers and/or property owners propose to jointly utilize existing or future core infrastructure of an existing or proposed sanitary sewer drainage basin at the same time, the costs of the associated improvements for each developer shall be determined based on the percentage of their contributing flow. The percentage of contributing flow for each entity shall be calculated on an Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU) basis. Drainage basins shall be defined by the City of Milford in its best interest. 
The City of Milford at its own discretion may elect to participate financially in the cost of the core infrastructure improvements. Should the City elect to participate in the project then the associated percentages for the core infrastructure between the City and each developer shall be specified in a Public Works Agreement. The City shall design, administer and inspect the project with construction of the improvements performed in a publicly bid process. An estimated cost for the design, administration and construction of the project will be prepared by the City as part of the Public Works Agreement and include a 10% contingency amount. The estimated cost to each developer and the City will be allocated in accordance with the executed Public Works Agreement with the contributions from each developer financially secured prior to execution of the Agreement by the City. Should total project costs exceed the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then each party shall pay for the additional cost(s) on the determined percentage basis at the time the cost is incurred by the City. Should the total project cost be less than the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then said funds shall be reimbursed to each party on the determined percentage basis. 
Should the City not elect to participate in the core infrastructure improvements then the developers are free to execute the design and construction of the core infrastructure privately. A Public Works Agreement will be prepared by the City to define the required improvements and determine the percentage contribution by each party. All work shall be performed in accordance with City of Milford Standards and Specifications and the developers shall be responsible for all City costs to prepare the Public Works Agreement and perform all plan reviews, project coordination and inspections associated with the project. 
B.  In a case where multiple developers and/or property owners propose to jointly utilize existing or future core infrastructure of an existing or proposed sanitary sewer drainage basin at different times, the costs of the associated improvements for each developer shall be determined based on the percentage of their contributing flow. The percentage of contributing flow for each entity shall be calculated on an equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) basis. Drainage basins shall be defined by the City of Milford in its best interest. 
The City of Milford at its own discretion may elect to participate in the cost of infrastructure upgrades to accommodate future developers who are not either ready or unwilling to immediately move forward with the development of their property within the sewer basin. The City shall contact each property owner within the City defined sewer basin to determine whether or not they would like to participate financially in the basin core infrastructure improvements. The properties within the basin shall then be defined as immediate participants (those properties interested in contributing immediately in the core infrastructure improvements) and future participants (those properties in the sewer basin not interested in immediately contributing in the core infrastructure). The City shall then decide whether or not they will participate in carrying the cost for said future participants in the form of Aid in Construction. 
Should the City not elect to participate in the core infrastructure improvements then the immediate developers are free to execute the design and construction of the core infrastructure privately. The core infrastructure would then be sized to accommodate only the improvements necessary to meet the needs of the immediate participants. A Public Works Agreement will be prepared by the City to define the required improvements and determine the percentage contribution by each party. All work shall be performed in accordance with City of Milford Standards and Specifications. The developers shall be responsible for all City costs to prepare the Public Works Agreement and perform all plan reviews, project coordination and inspections associated with the project. 
Should the City decide to participate in the project and construction of the core infrastructure, then the City will prepare a Public Works Agreement to define each immediate and future developer/property participant to be included within the sewer basin. The City shall design, administer and inspect the project with construction of the improvements performed in a publicly bid process. An estimated cost for the design, administration and construction of the project will be prepared by the City as part of the Public Works Agreement and include a 10% contingency amount. The estimated cost to each developer/property owner will be allocated in accordance with the executed Public Works Agreement with the contributions from each immediate developer financially secured prior to execution of the Agreement by the City. Should total project costs exceed the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then each immediate developer shall pay for the additional cost(s) on the determined percentage basis at the time the cost is incurred by the City. Should the total project cost be less than the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then said funds shall be reimbursed to each immediate developer on the determined percentage basis. 
If not defined by the future participant property owner, flow determinations for each future property included within the sewer basin shall be defined based on the maximum allowable density of the existing zoning at the time of the Agreement, or as determined practical by the City. Should the property be up zoned and/or future development exceeds the number of EDUs allocated to the property then said future participant or developer shall be responsible for all upgrades necessary to accommodate the increase. 
The immediate developer(s) and the City shall pay for the improvements on the percentage basis as defined in the Public Works Agreement. The City shall however be reimbursed for capital outlays plus interest by future participants/developer(s) for properties initially carried by the City as Aid in Construction. The Aid in Construction reimbursement to the City shall be based on the percentage of flow that each property defined as future will contribute to the core infrastructure up to the number of EDUs defined for said property in the Public Works Agreement. Aid in Construction costs allocated to future developer(s) shall be reimbursed to the City prior to plot plan recordation or commercial site plan approval, whichever applies. 
C.  The City Council has the right to modify, amend or waive any or all of the provisions contained in subsections (A) and (B) above. 
D.  No public funds will be utilized for any extension outside the City limits. Costs of such extensions shall be borne exclusively by the developer(s).

The Commission shall not require that more than 10% of the gross area of the open space of the subdivision to be so dedicated or reserved unless otherwise specified by the Zoning Code. 2 [] In case of a conflict, the requirement of the Zoning Code prevails. The Commission shall give due credit for the provision of open spaces reserved for the common use of all property owners within the proposed subdivision by covenants in the deeds. Generally, the minimum area of contiguous open space acceptable for dedication for public use shall be at least three acres and preferably five acres. Open spaces with a lesser area may be approved by the Commission whenever it deems that the difference between the area offered and three acres may be made up in connection with the future subdivision of adjacent land or added to an existing recreation area. 
(3)  School sites or sites for other public uses. The Commission may also require a subdivider to set aside such area as it may deem to be required for a school or other public use. Upon failure of the proper authorities to purchase such site within one year after the date of the approval of the plat, the subdivider, upon application to the Commission and approval of such application, shall be relieved of the responsibility of reserving such land for public purposes. 
(4)  Preservation of natural features. The Commission may require the preservation of all natural features which add value to residential developments and to the community, such as large trees or groves, watercourses and historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets. In no case shall a tree over 12 inches in diameter measured three feet from the base be removed without prior approval by the City Arborist. 
G.  General grading. No final slope on the property shall exceed the normal angle of repose of the soil of said slope as determined by the City Engineer, except where said slope consists of a natural rock formation or is supported by a retaining wall or equivalent of a design acceptable to the City Engineer. 
H.  Improvements. 
(1)  In major subdivisions the following improvements are required: 
(a)  Paved streets. 
(b)  Street signs. 
(c)  Curbs and gutters, or roadside swales. Curbs shall be required as per standard specifications to stabilize intersections, entrances, and parking areas, and where they are necessary for the conveyance of stormwater and protecting road surfaces and driveway surfaces from vehicular traffic. 
(d)  Sidewalks. 
(e)  Streetlighting. 
(f)  Shade trees. Shade trees 150 feet on center each side of the road shall be located so as not to interfere with utilities or sidewalks and shall be of the types recommended by the City Arborist. 
(g)  Topsoil protection. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used as spoil. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover to all areas of the subdivision and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. 
(h)  Monuments. Monuments shall be of the type, size and shape required by the City Engineer. 
(i)  Water mains, culverts, storm sewers and sanitary sewers. 
[1]  All water installations shall be looped; all sewer and storm sewer systems shall be extended at minimum slope, maximum depth, and connected with an approved method and shall be adequate to handle all present and probable future development. 
[2]  All of the above-listed improvements shall be subject to inspection and approval by the City Engineer, who shall be notified by the subdivider at least 24 hours prior to the start of construction. No underground installation shall be covered until inspected and approved. 
[3]  Utility easements shall be required to be granted and recorded by the subdivider to allow extension of utilities to neighboring properties. 
(j)  Swales. Conveyance of stormwater is permitted by open drainage systems where appropriate for environmental and engineering integrity and design. Such systems shall be separated from the edge of road to the top of bank by a minimum five-foot shoulder. The depth of such systems shall not exceed two feet below crown of road. The side slope shall be a maximum of 4:1. The bottom of the system shall have a minimum width of two feet. The system slope shall be such that the maximum velocity does not exceed two feet per second. The system has to be designed in such a way as to incorporate driveway and crossroad drainage pipes; such systems shall be restored with topsoil and sod. Temporary check dams shall be placed in intervals not to exceed 300 feet. 
(k)  Headwalls. Storm drainage pipes which are part of an open swale drainage system shall be terminated with a headwall in accordance with standard specifications. 
(2)  The developer shall complete all utilities and street improvements not specifically waived by the Commission in accordance with standard specifications as issued by the City Engineer and with any additional requirements specified by the Commission. Construction drawings shall be submitted in a form satisfactory to the City Engineer. 
(3)  When the Commission or the City Engineer, due to planning considerations extraneous to the subdivision, requires a standard of improvements higher than that which is sufficient to serve the subdivision, the amount of the bond to be posted shall be deemed to be satisfactory if it adequately covers the cost of improvements which would be normally required. 
(4)  The developer shall pay the review and inspection fees as set forth in Chapter 230, Zoning, § 230-57, Planning, Zoning and Engineering Fees. The cost for each segment or phase of the development shall be paid prior to commencement of utility construction.

§ 200-6. - Variances and waivers. 
Applicants may request, at the time of application submission, the varying or waiving of requirements of Chapter 200, and the Planning Commission may, at its discretion, recommend to City Council the varying or waiving of said requirements and request conditions that substantially secure the objectives of the requirements so waived. Upon the findings of the City Council that, due to special conditions peculiar to a subdivision or a site, certain requirements of these regulations are inappropriate or that strict compliance with said requirements may cause extraordinary and unnecessary hardships, the City Council may vary or waive said requirements, provided that such variance or waiver shall not be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare or have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Official Map, Chapter 230, Zoning, the Development Plan or this chapter. In varying or waiving certain requirements, the City Council may specify such conditions at will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the requirements so varied or waived.

§ 200-9. - Expiration of approved subdivision development plans. 
A.  The following regulations concerning expiration of recorded and approved plans are applicable to major subdivisions and minor subdivisions. 
B.  Construction of improvements shown on recorded subdivision plans shall commence within five years of the original recordation date and continue progressing toward completion. 
C.  The Department shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, applicants and landowners of properties involving approved plans where construction has not commenced one year prior to the expiration date and again six months prior to the expiration date that they are subject to the expiration provisions and identify their options for possible reapproval. 
D.  For the purpose of this section, "commencement of construction" shall mean: 
(1)  That a building permit or such other permit or approval by City of Milford or an applicable state agency has been issued and construction commenced under such permit which is visible on an inspection of the property by a representative of City. Such construction must be intended to accomplish the installation of improvements under Section 200-8, General Requirements and Design Standards, but excludes general earthmoving activities, and such work must have been started with a good-faith intention and purpose then formed to continue the work until completion. 
(2)  That all financial obligations associated with a City approved public works utility agreement have been satisfied and the improvements pursuant to said agreement have been completed, provided that the construction described in Subsection D(1) above shall commence within 10 years from receipt by the City of the final monetary contribution required under said agreement. 
E.  Construction shall be deemed to be progressing toward completion so long as there is no cessation in construction activity longer than 12 consecutive months. The City shall inspect sites semiannually to determine the progress of construction. If the City determines that construction activity has ceased for a period of 12 consecutive months or more, the staff shall notify the applicant and landowners by certified mail, return receipt requested, that construction shall recommence within 30 days or the subdivision shall be considered expired. 
F.  For subdivisions and land developments in which a certificate of occupancy has been issued for a dwelling, the subdivision shall no longer be subject to expiration. 
G.  The applicant and/or landowner shall bear the burden of providing evidence to the City establishing that construction has commenced within the five-year period and is progressing toward completion. 
H.  Applicants and/or landowners who have been notified that their projects may be subject to expiration have the following courses of action available to them: 
(1)  The applicant has the opportunity to provide evidence to the City establishing that construction has commenced; 
(2)  The applicant may apply to the City for reapproval of the project for an additional five-year period in accordance with the following procedures: 
(a)  The City shall review the original (i.e, initial) recorded and/or approved plan for consistency with all current provisions of this chapter, Chapter 230 Zoning, and the Comprehensive Plan. Such review may involve coordination with and review by applicable Development Advisory Committee (DAC) agencies. Based upon that review, the Planning Director will determine if the original recorded plan meets current standards, or if the original recorded plan requires minor revisions in order to comply with current standards, or if the original recorded plan must be resubmitted as a new application subject to all appropriate review procedures, regulations, and fees. 
(b)  In the event that the Planning Director determines that the original recorded plan is consistent with current policies and regulations, he/she shall reapprove the plan and provide written notice to the owner of reapproval. Such approval shall allow the issuance of building permits in accordance with all conditions of approval. The owner shall then have five years from the date of such notice of reapproval to obtain building permits and commence construction. 
(c)  Should the Planning Director determine that the plan requires minor revisions in order to comply with current policies and regulations, such notice shall be provided in writing and the applicant shall make such adjustments for administrative approval. Once the required minor revisions are completed, the plan may be reapproved administratively by the City Planning Department allowing the issuance of building permits subject to the provisions of the original record subdivision plan and/or any recorded resubdivision plans. The owner shall then have five years from the date of such notice of reapproval to obtain building permits and commence construction. 
(d)  Should the Planning Director determine that the plan would involve considerable revision to an extent that would change the scope of the project, the plan must be resubmitted for review by the Planning Commission and City Council for compliance with current policies and regulations. The City shall provide written notice to the owner of the specific areas of noncompliance. The landowner shall have the opportunity to make the necessary modifications to the plan and apply to the City as a new application in accordance with this chapter. Should new plans compliant with all current Code provisions be submitted, they must receive approval from the Planning Department, City Engineer, Planning Commission, and/or City Council, as applicable. Once reapproved, subdivision plans shall be recorded and shall have the effect of superseding the original record major subdivision plan. The owner/applicant shall then have five years from the date of reapproval to obtain building permits, commence construction, and progress toward completion. 
(3)  All of the above-referenced reviews, determinations, and reapprovals must be completed prior to the expiration of the five-year period. 
I.  Minor plan revisions, as described in Section 200-5, subsection E and F, that do not achieve full compliance with all current subdivision and land development provisions shall not reset the five-year time frame for commencement of construction and shall remain subject to expiration. 
J.  Should the five years lapse without the owner pursuing any of the options described in Subsections H(2)(a) through (d) above, the plan shall be considered expired. Expired subdivision plans shall be deleted from the City and County property records by deleting individual subdivision lots from the official City and County Tax Map and by eliminating the undeveloped parcels from the assessment records.

No service connection will be installed during the period that street openings are prohibited by City regulations or at any time when, in the judgment of the City, working conditions are unfavorable for installation either by reason of weather, temperature, conditions of soil or otherwise. The City will be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the service line between the main and the outlet of the meter. 
C.  The City reserves the right to charge a connection/inspection fee based on time and materials in any instance where unusual conditions for the installation of such a connection prevail. The determination to invoke this policy is a decision of the City Manager. 
D.  The location of service will be designated by the City, and no service line shall occupy the same trench with any facility of a public service company or be within three feet of any open excavation or vault, or within 10 feet of any sanitary sewer unless such installation plan shall have been previously authorized and approved by the City as evidenced by its written permission. 
E.  When it is necessary to renew an existing service line from the street main to the curb, the City will renew said service line of the same size in the same location as the old one, but if the applicant for his own convenience desires the new service line at some other location and agrees to pay all expenses of cutting off the old service line at the main, the City will lay the new service line at the location desired. 
F.  When the customer desires a change in location or size of an existing service line, the cost of the change shall be borne by the customer. 
G.  If one premises of one customer shall have one structure so divided by partition walls as to permit separate ownership, at any time, of the several divisions of the structure or shall have two or more separate and distinct structures thereon susceptible to more than one and the same ownership, the City will provide two or more separate service stops, as may be required, at the termination of one service connection of ample capacity, and the customer will be required to install, accordingly, two or more separate service lines. These costs shall be borne by the customer.

The operation of a service stop or valve is absolutely prohibited to anyone other than an employee of the City in the regular line of duty. 
[Ord. No. 2019-01, § 9, 3-11-2019] 
§ 222-14. - Supply of water; restrictions on use. 
A.

[Ord. No. 2019-01, § 10, 3-11-2019] 
§ 222-16. - Meters. 
A.  It is the City's intent to meter all customers. For the proper determination of water consumption and relevant bill for service, a meter will be installed in connection with each service line to record the quantity of water supplied to the customer's premises. The quantity of water recorded by the meter shall constitute conclusive determination for both the customer and the City, unless the meter shall be found to be registering inaccurately or has ceased to register, whereupon the quantity may be determined by the average registration of the meter when in proper working order. 
B.  All meters will be furnished and installed by the City and shall remain the property of the City. They shall be accessible to the City at all reasonable hours and shall be subject to its control exclusively. The City only shall possess the right to determine the style and size of the meter to be installed. 
C.  Metered service contemplates the supply of water through an individual service line and meter to each and every occupant of the premises supplied. Where the premises are not adapted for such separate meter installations, in the judgment of the City, one common service line will be permitted and one meter installation will be made accordingly. 
D.  The meter will be set after the customer has had the plumbing arranged to receive the meter at a convenient point approved by the City so as to control the entire supply. 
E.  Meters will be maintained by the City so far as ordinary wear is concerned, but loss or damage due to freezing, hot water or external causes shall be paid for by the customer. Where hot-water or heating systems or boilers are so constructed that there is a possibility of hot water being forced back through the meter, the customer shall protect the meter by installing a backflow preventer on the outlet side of the meter and shall, for his own protection, insert a safety valve in connection with the hot-water or heating system. The City will not be liable for any damage due to the failure of the customer's safety valve. 
F.  The fee for reinstallation or changing of a meter when removed because of damage not caused by the City shall be equal to the Meter Installation fee as listed in the Water Fee Schedule. 
G.  Meter accuracy. 
(1)  The City may test or replace a customer meter at any time after notification by the customer that he desires to have his meter tested. The Customer may request one courtesy meter test every two (2) years. Any request outside the two year period would require the meter testing fee as listed in the Water Fee Schedule. 
(2)  After receipt of a written request and meter testing fee as listed in the Water Fee Schedule, the City will test the accuracy of a customer's meter. If the meter accuracy is within plus or minus 2%, the meter is considered accurate, the meter testing fee shall be retained by the City. If the meter accuracy is not within plus or minus 2%, the meter will be replaced or repaired at the City's expense, and the meter testing fee shall be returned to the customer. 
H.  Liability for Tampering. Tampering is expressly forbidden. In the event of the City's meter or other property being tampered or interfered with, the Customer being supplied through such equipment shall pay the amount which the City may estimate is due for Service used but not registered on the City's meter, and for any repairs or replacements required, and such changes in Customer installations as may be required by the City. Furthermore, the Customer may be subject to a utility tampering fee in accordance with the Water Fee Schedule. When the City discovers evidence of tampering, services may be terminated and the police will be notified for possible criminal charges.

§ 222-21. - Liability. 
It shall be expressly understood and agreed by and among the customer receiving service and the City that the City assumes no liability as insurer of property or person and that the agreement does not contemplate any special service, pressure, capacity or facility, other than the ordinary or the changing conditions of the water supply system of the City, as the same exist from day to day. The City hereby declares and it is agreed by the customer by acceptance of service that the City shall be free and exempt from any and all claims for injury or damage to persons or property on customers' premises or to any other person or property by reason of fire, water or failure of water supply in pressure or capacity. 
§ 222-22. - Bills and payment. 
A.  Bills as rendered for any indicated period of service, either special, monthly or quarterly, will show the proper charge therefor as determined by the applicable rate schedule; also, they will show the amount of any abatement or deduction allowed or any fee or additional charge due and payable under the rules and regulations. Bills shall remain in the property owner's name and shall be considered as duly rendered when delivered at or mailed to the address as provided by the owner for that purpose. Nonreceipt of a bill shall never constitute a waiver thereof. The rates as established shall be an assessment and shall be billed to the owner of the property. All bills for water service are due and payable as indicated on the bill. Late fees for water service, if not paid by the due date, shall be charged beginning the day following the due date. 
B.  The bills for repairs or replacement of damaged meter installations or parts thereof will be rendered to the responsible party, either the occupant of the premises or the customer, and in case payment of the same is not made within 10 days after presentation of the bill, the City may shut off and discontinue the supply of water to the premises until all proper charges are paid. Such action by the City shall not preclude or stay collection of the damage bill by process of law. 
C.  In case the City has been unable for any reason to obtain the meter reading at the regular meter reading period, the City reserves the right to regularly bill the customer for an estimated consumption so indicated on the bill, which estimated consumption shall be deducted from the recorded consumption at the subsequent meter reading period, and the bill for the subsequent period shall be rendered accordingly. 
D.  Water and sewer service may be discontinued by the City after due notice for nonpayment of the bill at any time after the due date of the bill in accordance with the rule governing water service discontinuance.

§ 222-23. - Vacation or closing of premises. 
The customer shall notify the City in the event of vacation of premises or closing the same temporarily, requesting the City to shut off the water. In such case the meter will be read and a bill rendered accordingly; however, at the option of the City shutting off the water, the meter may be removed and the account closed as of that date. Such notification shall be in writing, delivered at the office of the City. The customer will be charged a re-connection fee for service discontinuance and service restoration as listed in the Water Fee Schedule. 
[Ord. No. 2019-01, § 14, 3-11-2019] 
§ 222-24. - Water used for steam generation.

§ 222-27. - Main extensions; public works agreement and aid-in-construction. 
A.  Property owner(s) and/or developer(s) proposing to submit for a Major Subdivision or Site Plan approval shall first submit a Utility Feasibility Study request to the City. Cost for the feasibility study shall be paid for by the applicant or applicants. The Utility Feasibility Study will be performed by the City and the results of the study used as the basis for defining the water service area(s) and associated core infrastructure improvements necessary to serve the development(s). 
B.  If one or more property owner(s) or developer(s) proposes a new development with an average daily flow of 2,500 gpd (10 EDUs) or more, to connect to the City's water infrastructure, but the infrastructure is not sized to handle both the average and peak daily flows (average daily flow multiplied by a peaking factor of 2.0 to 3.5, depending on the size of the system) from the existing users of the water service area and the proposed new development, the developer shall perform one of the following in addition to the payment of the impact fees and entering into a Development Agreement: 
(1)  If a single property owner/developer: Construct the necessary improvements to accommodate the existing users and the new proposed development as defined by the Utility Feasibility Study, prior to connecting to the City's system. All work shall be performed in accordance with City of Milford Standards and Specifications; or 
(2)  If multiple property owners or developers; Sign a Public Works Agreement with the City as further described in Section 222-27 Paragraph C. 
C.  Multiple Property Owners/Developers Public Works Agreements and Aid-in-Construction. 
(1)  In a case where multiple developers and/or property owners propose to jointly utilize existing or future core infrastructure of an existing or proposed water service area at the same time, the costs of the associated improvements for each developer shall be determined based on the percentage of their contributing flow. The percentage of contributing flow for each entity shall be calculated on an Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU) basis. Service areas shall be defined by the City of Milford in its best interest. 
The City of Milford at its own discretion may elect to participate financially in the cost of the core infrastructure improvements. Should the City elect to participate in the project then the associated percentages for the core infrastructure between the City and each developer shall be specified in a Public Works Agreement. The City shall design, administer and inspect the project with construction of the improvements performed in a publicly bid process. An estimated cost for the design, administration and construction of the project will be prepared by the City as part of the Public Works Agreement and include a 10% contingency amount. The estimated cost to each developer and the City will be allocated in accordance with the executed Public Works Agreement with the contributions from each developer financially secured prior to execution of the Agreement by the City. Should total project costs exceed the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then each party shall pay for the additional cost(s) on the determined percentage basis at the time the cost is incurred by the City. Should the total project cost be less than the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then said funds shall be reimbursed to each party on the determined percentage basis. 
Should the City not elect to participate in the core infrastructure improvements then the developers are free to execute the design and construction of the core infrastructure privately. A Public Works Agreement will be prepared by the City to define the required improvements and determine the percentage contribution by each party. All work shall be performed in accordance with City of Milford Standards and Specifications and the developers will be responsible for all City costs to prepare the Public Works Agreement and perform all plan reviews, project coordination and inspections associated with the project. 
(2)  In a case where multiple developers and/or property owners propose to jointly utilize existing or future core infrastructure of an existing or proposed water service area at different times, the costs of the associated improvements for each developer shall be determined based on the percentage of their contributing flow. The percentage of contributing flow for each entity shall be calculated on an equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) basis. Water service areas shall be defined by the City of Milford in its best interest. 
The City of Milford at its own discretion may elect to participate in the cost of infrastructure upgrades to accommodate future developers who are not either ready or unwilling to immediately move forward with the development of their property within the water service area. The City shall contact each property owner within the City defined water service area to determine whether or not they would like to participate financially in the service area core infrastructure improvements. The properties within the service area shall then be defined as immediate participants (those properties interested in contributing immediately in the core infrastructure improvements) and future participants (those properties in the water service area not interested in immediately contributing in the core infrastructure). The City shall then decide whether or not they will participate in carrying the cost for said future participants in the form of Aid in Construction. 
Should the City not elect to participate in the core infrastructure improvements then the immediate developers are free to execute the design and construction of the core infrastructure privately. The core infrastructure would then be sized to accommodate only the improvements necessary to meet the needs of the immediate participants. A Public Works Agreement will be prepared by the City to define the required improvements and determine the percentage contribution by each party. All work shall be performed in accordance with City of Milford Standards and Specifications. The developers will be responsible for all City costs to prepare the Public Works Agreement and perform all plan reviews, project coordination and inspections associated with the project. 
Should the City decide to participate in the project and construction of the core infrastructure, then the City will prepare a Public Works Agreement to define each immediate and future developer/property participant to be included within the water service area. The City shall design, administer and inspect the project with construction of the improvements performed in a publicly bid process. An estimated cost for the design, administration and construction of the project will be prepared by the City as part of the Public Works Agreement and include a 10% contingency amount. The estimated cost to each developer/property owner will be allocated in accordance with the executed Public Works Agreement with the contributions from each immediate developer financially secured prior to execution of the Agreement by the City. Should total project costs exceed the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then each immediate developer shall pay for the additional cost(s) on the determined percentage basis at the time the cost is incurred by the City. Should the total project cost be less than the estimated project cost plus 10% contingency then said funds shall be reimbursed to each immediate developer on the determined percentage basis. 
If not defined by the future participant property owner, flow determinations for each future property included within the water service area shall be defined based on the maximum allowable density of the existing zoning at the time of the Agreement, or as determined practical by the City. Should the property be up zoned and/or future development exceeds the number of EDUs allocated to the property then said future participant or developer shall be responsible for all upgrades necessary to accommodate the increase. 
The immediate developer(s) and the City shall pay for the improvements on the percentage basis as defined in the Public Works Agreement. The City shall however be reimbursed for capital outlays plus interest by future participants/developer(s) for properties initially carried by the City as Aid in Construction. The Aid in Construction reimbursement to the City shall be based on the percentage of flow that each property defined as future will contribute to the core infrastructure up to the number of EDUs defined for said property in the Public Works Agreement. Aid in Construction costs allocated to future developer(s) shall be reimbursed to the City prior to plot plan recordation or commercial site plan approval, whichever applies. 
(3)  The City Council has the right to modify, amend or waive any or all of the provisions contained in Subsection C(1) and C(2) above. 
(4)  No public funds will be utilized for any extension outside the City limits. Costs will be borne exclusively by the developer(s). 
D.  Mains shall be sized by the City to meet the applicant's domestic water needs. The applicant shall advise the City of main sizes necessary for fire protection. 
E.  Reserved. 
F.  No construction of water facilities shall commence until the plans submitted by the applicant are approved by the City, Fire Marshal, DHSS and other approval agencies as required. The main extension shall be referenced in the public works/utility agreement. No water service shall be provided by the City until the agreement is executed and the applicant has satisfied all municipal regulations. 
G.  All main extensions shall extend the entire length of the property to be served in all directions, unless otherwise approved by the City Manager. All water mains shall be looped to ensure a continual flow from either direction, with valves installed at each connection. Mains shall be extended to the property lines in a minimum of two locations as required by the City Engineer. 
H.  All main extensions shall be constructed in public rights-of-way or designated utility easements conveyed to the City. The applicant shall grant to the City any easements across his property that are necessary for the main extension or future extensions thereof. 
I.  The applicant shall construct all main extensions to the requirements and specifications of the City and shall bear all costs of the main construction, including the costs of inspection, as required by the City. 
J.  Normally, the applicant shall furnish and install, at his own expense, the necessary service connections. Each service connection will include the connection to the main, corporation stop, service line, curb stop, meter pit and appurtenances as per the latest edition of the City specifications. When the applicant furnishes and installs the service connection, the tapping and connection fees are waived. The applicant is responsible for any inspection and impact fees regardless of who furnishes and installs services. The City reserves the right, however, to furnish and install any service connection on its own. 
K.  The owner shall dedicate and the City will accept by written notification the dedication of any water mains and appurtenances constructed under the main extension as contained in the public works/utility agreement, provided that the same are installed and tested in compliance with City specifications. All costs incurred by the City for said testing shall be reimbursed by the owner at a rate of actual cost plus 10%. 
L.  The City reserves the right to construct the main extension on its own, at the applicant's expense. If the City decides to construct the main extension, an estimate of preconstruction costs including a 10% contingency fee will be furnished to the applicant for approval and for deposit of the estimated amount. After preconstruction engineering and administrative items are completed, an estimate of construction and related costs will be furnished to the applicant for approval and deposit. After receiving the deposits, the City will proceed with the main extension construction. A tabulation of the total main extension costs will be submitted to the applicant. If the total cost is less than the applicant's total deposits, the City will return any excess moneys deposited. If the total cost exceeds the applicant's deposits, the applicant shall pay the excess amount prior to the receipt of water service. 
M.  Deposits for main extensions shall not bear interest. 
N.  The public works/utility agreement, together with all its terms and conditions, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors or assignees or personal representatives of the parties thereto, but the agreement, other than the right to receive such payments as may be due thereunder, may not be assigned by the applicant without the prior written consent of the City.

The purpose of this section is to establish appropriate methods to assist in the capital financing of construction, improvements and expansion of the City of Milford water system in a manner which ensures that the cost associated with such construction, improvements and expansion is borne by those who generate a greater impact on the existing system. 
A.  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
EQUIVALENT DWELLING UNIT (EDU) - A term used to express the load produced on a water system approximately equal to one dwelling place (250 gallons per day). 
FIXTURE UNIT (FU) - A term having a value equal to 1/6 of a single EDU.

B.  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Code Official or other duly authorized representative, all developers or owners of newly constructed structures requiring water service shall pay the appropriate impact fee per EDU to the City of Milford. The City reserves the right to bar occupancy of any such structure and withhold water service until such time as the aforementioned fee is paid in full. The sum of the impact fee per EDU shall represent the impact fee to be used for construction, maintenance and expansion of the City's water system. 
C.  If two or more dwellings, apartments, stores, offices or industrial units are connected through a service line, the impact fee payable as listed in the Water Fee Schedule shall be computed as though each such dwelling, apartment, store, office, or industrial unit were a separate property or user with a separate connection to the water. 
D.  Specific assessment by usage category shall be defined in the most recent impact fee ordinance adopted by the Kent County Levy Court. 
E.  EDUs assigned to establishments not covered by the Kent County Ordinance shall assure that each establishment, in the opinion of the City Engineer, is given an assignment of EDUs compatible with its use of the City water system. The applicant shall submit a special EDU request for the planned water capacity needed. 
F.  No exemptions or abatements from the assessment of water impact fees shall be granted without the approval of City Council. Refer to Chapter 19 Economic Development and Redevelopment for Specific Economic Development Incentive Programs. 
G.  Existing structures destroyed or demolished will not be charged an impact fee for the reconstruction, provided that the replacement structure has the same or lower EDU count and occurs within 24 months of the demolition. If the EDU calculation results in an increase in service, then a pro rata fee will be charged on the change in EDUs. 
H.  If a developer proposes a new development with an average daily flow of 2,500 gpd or more, to connect to the City's water infrastructure (i.e., transmission lines, and/or other related appurtenances), but the infrastructure is not sized to handle both the peak daily demand and/or fire flows from the existing users of the drainage basin and the proposed new development, the developer shall perform one of the following in addition to the payment of the impact fees: 
(1)  Construct the necessary improvements to accommodate the existing users and the new proposed development, prior to connecting; or 
(2)  Sign a public works agreement stating that the necessary improvements will be constructed in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in said agreement.

(a)  Planned Residential Neighborhood Development. In order to encourage superior residential environments through a unified planning process, the Planned Residential Neighborhood Development shall be permitted in the R-1 Single Family Residential District Zone as a conditional use subject to the provisions of this chapter and after a determination by the Planning Commission that the proposed planned neighborhood design presents a community design that would not be possible under the conventional zone and is in accordance with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. The minimum size required for a Planned Residential Neighborhood Development (PRND) shall be 10 acres. 
(b)  Review process. The planned neighborhood design option shall involve a three-step review and approval process. In the first step, the developer shall meet with the City Council and present a general sketch plan and a statement documenting the project's compliance with the goals of the Comprehensive Plan for review. The general sketch plan shall reflect the general layout of streets, open space, and housing areas and types. The City Council shall determine whether the proposed project is of such a design and type that it warrants further review by the Planning Commission. If the City Council determines that further review is warranted, the second step shall be the conditional use review process which involves the submission of a conceptual plan which conforms in content to the design standards and requirements specified in this section, as well as the plan submission requirements of this chapter and Subdivision Ordinance. If the conditional use/conceptual subdivision plan is approved, the plan would proceed to the third step which involves the submission of a site development plan and preliminary/final subdivision plans for review and approval by the Planning Commission and City Council. 
(c)  Maximum density. The gross residential density in a Planned Residential Neighborhood Development shall not exceed four dwelling units per acre, however the density could be increased to eight dwelling units per acre, provided the development provides the amenities listed under the density bonus section. In no case shall the development exceed eight dwellings units per gross acre. 
(d)  Design standards. The design standards and dimensional requirements (bulk and parking regulations) shall be in accordance with this chapter. 
[1]  Lot coverage. Based on the following type of residential construction, the following is the maximum lot coverage: 
[a]  Single-family detached dwelling: 35%. 
[b]  Single-family semidetached dwelling: 35%. 
[c]  Single-family attached dwelling: 40%. 
[d]  Garden apartments/condominiums: 30%. 
[2]  Minimum setback areas. New buildings shall observe a twenty-five-foot minimum front yard, ten-foot minimum side yards, and a twenty-five-foot minimum rear yard. 
[3]  Height of buildings. The height of buildings shall not exceed three stories or 35 feet. Accessory buildings shall not exceed 15 feet in height. 
[4]  Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall be provided for residents, visitors and employees of the facility. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that, based on total potential occupancy load (resident, visitor and employee), a sufficient number of off-street parking spaces will be provided. 
(e)  Design requirements. 
[1]  Common open space. 
[a]  The area set aside and preserved for open space shall aggregate no less than 25 percent of the total site area. Common open space shall be provided in the PRND proposals. The common open space shall not include any wetlands, floodways or similar area not suitable for building as determined by the Planning Commission and City Council. Significant natural features shall be incorporated into common open space whenever possible. 
[b]  The common open space shall be designed as a contiguous area if possible, and shall be interspersed with residential areas so as to provide pedestrian access and visual amenity. The common open space shall be designed and maintained by the property owner/s or an HOA. Recreational areas shall be constructed and may be located within the 25% of open space set aside. 
[2]  Planned neighborhoods. The area set aside and preserved for open space shall aggregate no less than 25% of the total site area. 
[3]  Buffers. Buffers shall be required to provide transition between planned residential development and adjacent properties/rights-of-way or changes in land use. Buffers should consist of earth berms and a planting area. No building shall be constructed less than 40 feet from the perimeter property line of the development. This buffer may consist of either common open space, earth berms, planting areas or private yards or a combination of both; however, no more than 30% of the required buffer area may be counted toward the minimum common open area requirement. 
[4]  Disruption of natural environment. The planned neighborhood design development shall be designed and scheduled so as to minimize earthmoving, erosion, tree clearance and other disruption of the natural environment. Existing vegetation shall be preserved wherever possible. Where extensive natural tree cover and vegetation do not exist or cannot be preserved on the site, landscaping shall be undertaken in order to enhance the appearance of the development and screen streets and parking areas, and enhance privacy of private dwellings. Natural drainage systems shall be preserved wherever possible. 
[5]  Privacy. Dwelling unit structures shall be located and arranged so as to promote privacy for residents within the development and maintain privacy for residents adjacent to the development. Recreational and nonresidential uses shall be located and designed so as not to interfere with nearby residential areas. All structures and activities located near the periphery of the site shall be designed so as to harmonize with neighboring areas. 
(f)  Density bonus. 
[1]  A density bonus may be granted if the developer furnishes improvements that significantly demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the improvements contribute to superior design and which exceed the standard requirements of the city ordinances in accordance with the following schedule: 
[a]  Open space. For each increase of 10% in common open space over the minimum requirement of 25%, a density bonus of 10% shall be granted. 
[b]  Housing types. Neighborhood design which integrates a variety of housing types to provide architectural diversity and which avoids monotony and segregation by dwelling type in order that single housing type does not dominate the planned neighborhood or section thereof shall be awarded a density bonus of 10%. The term "housing type" refers to each of the following dwelling types: single-family detached houses, semidetached and duplex houses, multiplexes, townhouses, and garden apartments. 
[c]  Public buildings. The construction and leasing of a public building, including a firehouse, or a library, or a branch library which is necessitated, either wholly or partially, by the development, may increase the permitted density by 10%, if approved by the City, the Planning Commission and the agency to which the building is to be leased.

E.  Boundary determination for source water protection areas. 
(1)  All subdivision and land development plans depicting development or land disturbance submitted for City review shall be evaluated for the existence of source water protection areas. All such areas are as depicted on source water protection area maps maps/overlays are available from Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), Division of Water Resources, Source Water Assessment and Protection Program (SWAPP). If a SWPA exists within a proposed development site, the boundaries of these areas shall be delineated on the plan by the applicant's State of Delaware professional engineer or professional geologist. 
(2)  DNREC SWAPP may, when based on sound science and information, revise and update the overlay maps of wellhead protection areas. 
(3)  The Delaware Geological Survey (DGS) may, when based on sound science and information, revise and update the overlay maps of good or excellent groundwater recharge potential areas. 
(4)  When there appears to be a conflict between the mapped boundary and actual site conditions, the applicant may engage the services of professional geologist to prepare a report intended to determine more accurately the precise boundary of the source water protection area. The Report shall include: 
(a)  A detailed topographic layout of the subdivision and/or area to be developed and prepared by a state-registered professional land surveyor or professional geologist; 
(b)  Evidence derived from a site-specific investigation that may include aquifer testing, test borings, test pits, observation wells, groundwater elevations, and topography surveys as appropriate for the type of source water protection area that clearly demonstrates that the area in question does not meet the definition of a source water protection area as defined. 
(c)  Any challenges to the delineations of the good or excellent groundwater recharge potential areas must follow the methods used in the Delaware Geological Survey publication: Report of Investigations No. 66, Groundwater Recharge Potential Mapping in Kent and Sussex Counties, Delaware. The challenge must be approved by DGS and DNREC SWAPP. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, if an owner initiates a precise boundary delineation pursuant to this section, any and all time review limitations shall be stayed pending the submission of the complete report contemplated by this section. Following submission of the report and all supporting documents, DNREC shall have 90 days to finally approve or disapprove the exploratory sketch plan submission or such further time as deemed necessary by the Department, but not to exceed an additional 90 days. 
F.  Environmental impact assessment report. 
(1)  New development may exceed the 20% impervious cover threshold within the Source Water Protection Area Zone 2, but be no more than 50% impervious, provided the applicant submits an environmental assessment report including a climatic water budget and systems to augment recharge that assure water quality as well as quantity. The environmental impact assessment must document that postdevelopment recharge will be no less than predevelopment recharge when computed on an annual basis. 
(2)  Commonly, the applicant offsets the loss of recharge due to impervious cover by constructing recharge basins that convey pretreated rooftop runoff for infiltration to groundwater. Refer to Supplement 1, entitled Groundwater Recharge Design Methodology, for the details of how to design recharge facilities in Delaware source water protection areas. 
(3)  A Delaware registered professional engineer and/or professional geologist prepares an environmental assessment report, usually containing the following elements of planning, design, construction, and maintenance of groundwater recharge facilities: 
(a)  Site description of proposed development within the water resource protection area. 
(b)  Climatic water balance comparing predevelopment and postdevelopment recharge potential. 
(c)  Subsurface exploration, including borings, test pits, and infiltration tests. 
(d)  Design of groundwater recharge facilities that assure water quality as well as quantity. 
(e)  Construction and maintenance considerations. 
(f)  Recommended groundwater monitoring plan. 
(g)  Water management agreement between the applicant and the town, city, or county providing for monitoring and maintenance of the recharge system. The applicant will abide by the Groundwater Management Agreement as written in DNREC Supplement 1 to the Source Water Protection Guidance Manual for the Local Governments of Delaware: Groundwater Recharge Design Methodology, dated May 2005 or as later revised. 
G.  Nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses may continue in a source water protection area in the form in which they existed at the time of the adoption of this section, unless they pose a direct hazard to the City's water supply, as determined by the Water and Wastewater Department upon advice from the Delaware Division of Public Health, or are causing some foreign substances (oil, salts, chemicals, or other substances) to be introduced into the City's water supply, as determined by the Water and Wastewater Department upon advice from DNREC's Division of Air and Waste Management and/or Division of Water Resources. In the latter case, the Building Department shall issue a mandatory cease and desist to stop the offending activity within the area.

When in the public interest and where loss or damage has occurred to property, to include land and/or buildings occupied by nonconforming uses, and where such loss or damage has occurred through the action of a governmental agency, the Board of Adjustment, as provided in Article VII of this chapter, may grant as a special exception, after a public hearing, continuance of the nonconforming use. The Board of Adjustment may further limit but not extend such nonconforming use, to include the size and location on the land of any reconstructed buildings, the modification of existing buildings and the use of the property either on the same lot or on a contiguous lot under the same ownership at the time of enactment of this chapter. 
F.  A nonconforming use of a building or a nonconforming use of a nonconforming building may be extended either on the same lot or to a contiguous lot under the same ownership at the time of enactment of this chapter if granted as a special exception by the Board of Adjustment, as provided in Article VII of this chapter, subject to the following special requirements: 
(1)  The extension is for a use which is necessarily incident to the existing use; 
(2)  The estimated cost of any extension involved does not exceed 50% of the replacement value, as appraised by the Kent County or Sussex County Assessor, of the existing building to which it is incident; 
(3)  Such extension shall have a floor area not to exceed 25% of the floor area of the existing building to which it is incident; 
(4)  It will not impair the value of the adjoining property or adversely affect the character of the neighborhoods; and 
(5)  Provided that only one extension shall be permitted by the Board of Adjustment during the life of a nonconforming use. 
§ 230-40. - Restoration of existing buildings.

[Ord. No. 2015-03, § 3, 6-22-2015] 
ARTICLE IX - Conditional Uses 

§ 230-46. - Purpose. 
A.  The intent of the conditional use is to maintain a measure of control over uses that have an impact on the entire community. Generally, conditional uses may be desirable in certain locations for the general convenience and welfare. They must use the property in a manner that assures neither an adverse impact upon adjoining properties nor the creation of a public nuisance. In short, because of the nature of the use, it requires sound planning judgment on its location and site arrangement. 
B.  Conditional use permits may be issued for any of the conditional uses for which a use permit is required by the provisions of this chapter, provided that the City Council shall find that the application is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter after duly advertised hearings held in accordance with the provisions of Article XII. 
§ 230-47. - Application and approval procedures. 
A.  The application for a conditional use shall first be made with the Code Official, who shall then forward the materials to the Planning Commission. 
B.  The Planning Commission shall study such information and make recommendations to the City Council within 60 days of the Code Official's referral to the Commission after holding a public hearing. 
C.  The Council shall then act within 60 days of the receipt of the Commission's recommendation to either approve with conditions or deny such use after holding a public hearing. The Council's decision shall be based on the determination that the location of the use is appropriate, it is not in conflict with the Comprehensive Plan and it is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
§ 230-48. - Criteria for evaluation. 
The following criteria shall be used as a guide in evaluating a proposed conditional use: 
A.  The presence of adjoining similar uses. 
B.  An adjoining district in which the use is permitted. 
C.  There is a need for the use in the area proposed as established by the Comprehensive Plan. 
D.  There is sufficient area to screen the conditional use from adjacent different uses. 
E.  The use will not detract from permitted uses in the district. 
F.  Sufficient safeguards, such as traffic control, parking, screening and setbacks, can be implemented to remove potential adverse influences on adjoining uses. 
§ 230-48.1. - Criteria for planned unit residential development. 
[Added 6-11-2001 by Ord. No. 4-2001; amended 10-25-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-9] 
A.  Permitted uses. Uses, accessory uses and signs permitted in any residential district shall be permitted in accordance with the additional requirement and provisions of the article. 
B.  Minimum requirements, area and width. In a planned unit residential development, minimum lot area and width may be less than that required by the district regulations, except that no single-family lot shall be less than 4,000 square feet in area nor less than 40 feet in width. The width of the lot shall be between lot lines at the front building setback line as determined by the Planning Commission. 
C.  Density. A planned unit residential development is not intended to increase density, but to allow flexibility in the design of the number of dwelling units permitted. If a parcel or parcels have more than one zoning classification, the total permitted density may be located throughout the parcel or parcels. The total permitted density shall be determined by dividing the net development area by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the zoning district in which the land is located. Net development area shall be determined by subtracting 25% of the gross area. Gross area shall not include any wetlands, floodway or similar area not suitable for building as determined by the Planning Commission. 
D.  Other requirements. Off-street parking, parking beneath buildings, front, side and rear setbacks, landscaping and buffering, lot coverage, number of units per building and building separation shall be as determined by the Planning Commission. Maximum height shall not exceed 48 feet and four stories maximum. 
E.  A planned unit residential development shall be subject to the same review procedures as for a major subdivision as provided in Chapter 200, Subdivision of Land. 
[Added 5-22-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-2]

(7)  Density. The overall density otherwise permitted under planned unit development shall be reduced at the rate of one dwelling unit per 3,000 square feet of commercial floor space. 
G.  A minimum of 400 square feet per unit shall be designated as open space subject to the recreational use. Recreational use requirement - 50% of the required open space shall be set aside for recreational use. 
[Ord. No. 2009-17, § 5, 4-26-2010] 
§ 230-49. - Conditions for approval; expiration. 
A.  In granting any conditional use permit, the City Council may designate such conditions as will, in its opinion, assure that the use will conform to the requirements as stated in § 230-48 and that such use will continue to do so. 
B.  Construction or operation shall be commenced within one year of the date of issuance or the use permit becomes void. 
C.  A reapplication for a use permit for the same lot or use shall not be considered by the City Council within a period of 365 days from its last consideration. This provision, however, shall not impair the right of the Council to propose a use permit on its own motion. 
D.  See fee schedule. 
[Amended 5-11-1998 by Ord. No. 4-1998] 
E.  If a conditional use permit is granted under the provisions of this article, the City Council shall direct the Code Official to officially notify the applicant, in writing, of all conditions approved by the Council. 
F.  The approval of a conditional use is valid for one year. Unless permits are obtained or construction or use is substantially underway, all provisions of the conditional use are automatically rescinded. Permits may be revoked by the Council for failure to comply with the stated conditions of approval or applicable regulations. 
ARTICLE X - Site Plan Review 

§ 230-50. - Purpose. 
[Amended 9-8-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-13] 
The site plan review has a twofold purpose. It is to assure that the large-scale developments are in accord with the Comprehensive Plan and that such developments comply with the regulations of this chapter. Site plans are required to assure good arrangement and appearance of new development; ensure harmony with existing structures; assure consistency with the City's adopted building and design standards, the Comprehensive Plan, and the City's Standard Specifications for Installation of Utility Construction Projects and Subdivision Pavement Design; to provide an understanding of the impacts of proposed development on public facilities and services and ensure the availability and adequacy of the same; and to otherwise meet the purposes of this chapter. 
§ 230-51. - Guidelines. 
Guidelines for determining what site plans shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission shall be as follows:

(1)  If the traffic flow will be greatly altered. Flow includes: 
(a)  Pattern. 
(b)  Volume. 
(c)  Hazard involved. 
(d)  Time involved. 
(2)  If parking on a large scale is required. 
(3)  If public utilities or works must be expanded to accommodate the development. 
(4)  If there is a change in the existing land use pattern. 
(5)  If there are incompatible uses within the proposed development or in relation to the abutting districts.

APPENDIX A - STATE ACTS 
Chapter A240 
STATE ACTS 
ARTICLE I - Valuation of Agricultural, Horticultural and Forest Land Use 
[9 Del. C. §§ 8328 to 8336] 

§ 8328. - Purpose. 
It is declared that it is in the public interest to: 
(1)  Encourage the preservation of farm land in order to maintain a readily available source of food and farm products close to the metropolitan areas of the State, to conserve the State's natural resources and to provide for the welfare and happiness of the inhabitants of the State; 
(2)  Prevent the forced conversion of farm land and forest land to more intensive uses as a result of economic pressures caused by the assessment thereof for purposes of property taxation at values incompatible with their preservation as such farm land and forest land; and 
(3)  That the necessity of the enactment of the provisions of this section is a matter of legislative determination. 
§ 8329. - Valuation of agricultural, horticultural and forest land use. 
For general property tax purposes including school tax purposes, the value of land which is actively devoted to agricultural, horticultural or forest use and which has been so devoted for at least the 2 successive years immediately preceding the tax year in issue, shall, on application of the owner, and approval thereof as provided in this section, be that value which such lands have for agricultural, horticultural or forest use; provided, that in the case of school taxes where such land is located in a public school district situated in 2 counties, the value of such land shall be that value arrived at by multiplying the value determined hereunder by the lower of the 2 general percentage rates of assessment in force in such counties for the tax year in issue. 
§ 8330. - Agricultural use land. 
Land shall be deemed to be in agricultural use when devoted to the production for sale of plants and animals useful to man, including but not limited to: Forages and sod crops; grains and feed crops; dairy animals and dairy products; poultry and poultry products; livestock, including beef cattle, sheep, swine, horses, ponies, mules or goats, including the breeding and grazing of any or all of such animals; bees and apiary products; fur animals; trees and forest products; or when devoted to and meeting the requirements and qualifications for payments or other compensation pursuant to a soil conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the federal government. 
§ 8331. - Horticultural use land. 
Land shall be deemed to be in horticultural use when devoted to the production for sale of fruits of all kinds, including grapes, nuts and berries; vegetables; nursery, floral, ornamental and greenhouse products; or when devoted to and meeting the requirements and qualifications for payments or other compensation pursuant to a soil conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the federal government. 
§ 8332. - Forest use land. 
Land shall be deemed to be in forest use when devoted to tree growth in such quantity and so spaced and maintained as to constitute in the opinion of the State Forester a forest area. 
§ 8333. - Criteria for land use. 
Land shall be deemed to be actively devoted to agricultural, horticultural or forestry use when (i) not less than 10 acres are in such use, and the gross sales of agricultural, horticultural or forestry products produced thereon together with any agricultural program payments and sales of commodities received under government entitlement programs have averaged at least $1,000 per year within a 2-year period of time immediately preceding the tax year in issue, or there is clear evidence of anticipated yearly gross sales and such payments amounting to at least $1,000 per year, within a 2-year period of time, or (ii) less than 10 acres are in such use and the gross sales of agricultural, horticultural or forestry products produced thereon together with any agricultural program payments and sales of commodities received under government entitlement programs shall have averaged at least $10,000 per year within a 2-year period of time immediately preceding the tax year in issue, or there is clear evidence of anticipated yearly gross sales and such payments amounting to at least $10,000 per year within a 2-year period of time. In computing such anticipated yearly gross sales for land under 10 acres in such use, the maximum amount computed from future sales of forestry products shall be not more than $2,000 annually. In applying these criteria, and in determining whether the minimum acreage requirements are met, all contiguous parcels of land held by identical owners in identical proportions of ownership and in identical legal form of title, shall be considered as a single unit. 
§ 8334. - Eligibility for valuation under §§ 8330-8337. 
Land which is actively devoted to agricultural, horticultural or forest use shall be eligible for valuation, assessment and taxation as provided in this section when it meets the following qualifications: 
(1)  It has been so devoted for at least the two successive years immediately preceding the tax year for which valuation under this section is requested; 
(2)  The area of such land (i) is not less than 10 acres in such use, and the gross sales of agricultural, horticultural or forestry products produced thereon together with any agricultural program payments and sales of commodities received under government entitlement programs have averaged at least $1,000 per year within a 2-year period of time immediately preceding the tax year in issue, or there is clear evidence of anticipated yearly gross sales and such payments amounting to at least $1,000 per year, within a 2-year period of time, or (ii) is less than 10 acres in such use and the gross sales of agricultural, horticultural or forestry products produced thereon together with any agricultural program payments and sales of commodities received under government entitlement programs shall have averaged at least $10,000 per year within a 2-year period of time immediately preceding the tax year in issue, or there is clear evidence of anticipated yearly gross sales and such payments amounting to at least $10,000 per year within a 2-year period of time. In computing such anticipated yearly gross sales for land under 10 acres in such use, the maximum amount computed from future sales of forestry products shall not be more than $2,000 annually. In applying these criteria, and in determining whether the minimum acreage requirements are met, all contiguous parcels of land held by identical owners in identical proportions of ownership and in identical legal form of title, shall be considered as a single unit. 
(3)  Application by the owner of such land for valuation under this section is submitted on or before February 1 of the year immediately preceding the tax year to the assessor of the taxing district in which such land is situated on the form prescribed by the State Farmland Evaluation Advisory Committee together with evidence in writing of the required sales, payments and anticipated sales and payments. 
§ 8335. - Assessment procedures. 
(a)  The assessor in valuing land which qualifies as land actively devoted to agricultural, horticultural or forestry use under the tests prescribed by this section, and as to which the owner thereof has made timely application for valuation, assessment and taxation under this section for the tax year in issue, shall consider only those indicia of value of such land as established by the State Farmland Evaluation Advisory Committee. 
(b)  In determining the total area of land actively devoted to agricultural, horticultural or forest use there shall be included the area of all land under barns, sheds, silos, cribs, greenhouses and like structures, lakes, dams, ponds, streams, irrigation ditches and like facilities, but land under, and such additional land as may be actually used in connection with the farmhouse, shall be excluded in determining such total area. 
(c)  All structures which are located on land in agricultural, horticulture or forest use and the farmhouse and the land on which the farmhouse is located, together with the additional land used in connection therewith, shall be valued, assessed and taxed by the same standards, methods and procedures as other taxable structures and other land in the taxing district. 
(d)  When land in agricultural use and being valued, assessed and taxed under the provisions of this chapter, is applied to a use other than agriculture, it shall be subject to additional taxes, hereinafter referred to as roll-back taxes, in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the taxes paid or payable on the basis of the valuation and the assessment authorized hereunder and the taxes that would have been paid or payable had the land been valued, assessed and taxed as other land in the taxing district, in the current tax year immediately preceding, in which the land was valued, assessed and taxed hereunder. 
(1)  If in the tax year in which a change in use of land occurs the land was not valued, assessed and taxed under this chapter, then such land shall be subject to roll-back taxes in the following manner. If the change of the use of land occurs prior to January 1, 1996, then such land shall be subject to roll-back taxes for the five tax years immediately preceding in which the land was valued, assessed and taxed hereunder. If the change in use of land occurs between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1996, then such land shall be subject to roll-back taxes for the 6 tax years immediately preceding in which the land was valued, assessed and taxed hereunder. If the change in use of land occurs between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1997, then such land shall be subject to roll-back taxes for the 7 tax years immediately preceding in which the land was valued, assessed and taxed hereunder. If the change in use of land occurs between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 1998, then such land will be subject to roll-back taxes for the 8 tax years immediately preceding in which the land was valued, assessed and taxed hereunder. If the change in use of land occurs between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 1999, then such land shall be subject to roll-back taxes for the 9 tax years immediately preceding in which the land was valued, assessed and taxed hereunder. If the change in use of land occurs on January 1, 2000, or thereafter, then such land shall be subject to roll-back taxes for the 10 tax years immediately preceding in which the land was valued, assessed and taxed hereunder. 
(2)  In determining the amounts of the roll-back taxes chargeable on land which has undergone a change in use, the assessor shall for each of the roll-back tax years involved, ascertain: 
a.  The full and fair value of such land under the valuation standard applicable to other land in the taxing district; 
b.  The amount of the additional assessment on the land for the particular tax year by deducting the amount of the actual assessment on the land for that year from the amount of the land assessment determined by the assessing authority; and 
c.  The amount of the roll-back tax for that tax year by multiplying the amount of the additional assessment determined under paragraph b. of this subdivision by the general property tax rate of the taxing district applicable for that tax year. 
(3)  Roll-back taxes as provided herein shall become payable when the land is applied to a use other than agricultural, horticultural or forestry. The terms "applied to a use other than agriculture" and "change in use" for purposes of this subsection shall include any of the following: 
a.  The actual use of the land for an activity other than agricultural, horticultural or forestry; 
b.  The rezoning of the land to a nonagricultural category; 
c.  The subdivision of the land which allows for a nonagricultural usage; 
d.  The approval of a site plan or issuance of a certificate of occupancy which allows for a nonagricultural usage; and 
e.  The loss of eligibility for valuation under §§ 8330-8337 of this title. 
(4)  Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, whenever land in agricultural use is applied to a use other than agriculture, and such land is but a portion of a larger tract of land, the remainder of which continues in agricultural use, roll-back taxes as provided herein shall become payable only with respect to the portion of the land which is applied to a use other than agricultural, and the remainder of the land which continues in agricultural use shall remain eligible for valuation under §§ 8330-8337 of this title, provided the criteria for land use set forth under § 8333 continue to be satisfied. The owner of the land which continues in agricultural use shall not be required to apply for eligibility for valuation, and the burden for establishing ineligibility shall rest with the assessing authority. 
(5)  Roll-back taxes hereunder shall be paid within 90 days of their due date, and payment thereafter shall include a penalty of six percent of the amount due for the 1st month thereafter, and one percent of the amount due for each consecutive month until payment is made. The amount due for roll-back tax shall become a lien on the land which was subject to a change in use or applied to a use other than agriculture as of the due date. The school tax component of the roll-back tax shall be paid to the respective school districts which established the tax rates applicable to the lands through a payment first to the appropriate county receiver of taxes, treasurer or director of finance, who collects school taxes. The balance of the roll-back tax shall, when collected by the appropriate county receiver of taxes, treasurer or director of finance, be paid to the Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation; provided, however, that seven and a half percent of such balance shall be withheld and paid to the county as a charge for administration. For purposes of this paragraph, the due date shall be the earlier of the date following conversion under paragraph (3) of this subsection which is established by the respective counties for annual taxes or the date indicated by the county in any special billing for roll-back taxes. 
(6)  When land in agricultural use and being valued, assessed and taxed under the provisions of this chapter, is acquired for public use by state agencies, whether by condemnation, gift or purchase, and is then applied to a use other than agriculture, that portion of the land which is applied to such other use shall be subject to a payment by the agency in lieu of roll-back taxes, to be paid to the Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation. The amount of this payment in lieu shall be determined as if it were the roll-back tax chargeable under this section for the tax year in which the land was acquired by the agency, or the tax year in which the land is applied to such other use, whichever is greater, after first deducting the school tax component of the roll-back tax chargeable for that year. This payment shall be made directly by the agency to the foundation, after obtaining the assessment information from the appropriate county receiver of taxes, treasurer or director of finance, and shall not be subject to any charge for administration by the county. In all other respects, the land so acquired for such public use shall not be assessed or charged for roll-back or other property taxes by any county, school district or other political subdivision. 
§ 8336. - Annual review. 
(a)  Eligibility of land for valuation, assessment and taxation under this section shall be determined for each tax year separately. Application shall be submitted by the owner to the assessor of the taxing district in which such land is situated on or before February 1 of the year immediately preceding the tax year for which such valuation, assessment and taxation are sought; provided however, that unless the eligibility of land under this section changes, those applications which have met the provisions to qualify under this chapter shall be automatically renewed without the owner having to apply annually. With respect to new applications, eligibility of the land for valuation, assessment and taxation under this section shall be conditioned upon advance execution by the landowner of a certification, in recordable form, as provided by the Delaware Agricultural Lands Preservation Foundation, which certification indicates that a roll-back tax is due and payable to the school districts and the Foundation under the provisions of 9 Del. C. § 8335(d) at such time that the land is subjected to a change in use or applied to a use other than agricultural, horticultural or forestry, as such terms are defined, and that a failure to pay the roll-back tax when due results in the imposition of a lien on the land for nonpayment. 
(b)  (1)  If the eligibility of land under this section changes the owner shall on or before February 1, of the following year in which the eligibility of the land changes, notify the assessing authority in the taxing district, in writing, of the change in land use. 
(2)  Any owner who fails to properly notify the assessing authority in the tax district of the change in land use shall be assessed a penalty for such failure in an amount of 20% of the rollback taxes recoverable against the property, which penalty shall be collected by the taxing district.

The City will not begin field layout or construction of facilities until suitable Right-of-Way agreements have been executed. 
If it is necessary to acquire Right-of-Way from others such as abutting property owners, lessors, railroads, etc., in order for the City to serve the Applicant, then the Applicant shall be responsible for obtaining such Right-of-Way at its own cost. The City shall not in any way be subject to any claims from the Applicant/Customer deriving from delays in obtaining Right-of-Way. Where, due to the nature of the property to be served, the City finds that the exact boundaries are of critical importance, the Applicant will locate and mark such boundaries to the reasonable satisfaction of the City. 
Applicant shall be responsible for clearing all trees, tree stumps and other obstructions from the construction area as designated by the City and the said clearing to be completed in reasonable time to meet Service requirements to the City's satisfaction determined by the City at its sole discretion.

However, if the Customer is delinquent in any two consecutive months after Service is initiated, a Deposit may be charged at the same rate as if the Customer is a renter. (See the Fee Schedule, Appendix 1) Service may be terminated for failure to pay the Deposit when requested. If the Customer fails to pay his bill, a lien may be placed against his property and his Service may be terminated in accordance with Section 5.6 and Section 16. On presentation of facts indicating that payment of a Deposit would create a severe hardship, the City may allow payment of the required Deposit to be deferred to the first month's bill or paid in three consecutive billing periods. 
4.3  COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS 
A Deposit will be charged to all new commercial Customers with an electric account. Electric service will not be connected until the deposit is paid. (See the Fee Schedule, Appendix 1) 
On presentation of facts indicating that payment of a Deposit would create a severe hardship, the City may allow payment of the required Deposit to be deferred to the first month's bill or paid in three consecutive billing periods. 
In the case of Customers with an expected monthly load of 500 KW or an expected monthly bill above $5,000, the City may choose to waive the Deposit. In such cases, in lieu of a Deposit, the City will accept a surety bond from a bank, the proceeds of which shall equal two times the expected monthly bill. 
4.4  PROVISIONS FOR ALL DEPOSITS 
4.4.A  Deposits shall be in an amount equal to two-twelfths of the estimated annual revenue or a minimum as may be reasonably required by the City. (See Appendix 1-Fee Schedule) No interest will be paid on Deposits from the Residential Customers. Accrued interest earned will be paid on the Deposits from all non-residential customer classes. Interest will be paid at the time the Deposit is returned to the Customer. No interest will be paid unless the Deposit is held longer than ninety days. 
4.4.B  The deposit shall cease to draw interest: On the date the deposit is returned to the Customer, or on the date service is terminated, or on the date notice is sent to the Customer's last known address that the deposit is no longer required.

5.3  PAYMENTS OF DELINQUENT BILLS 
The Customer may avoid Service termination for non-payment of bills by making payment of the total unpaid balance to the City cashier during the Hours of Operation (See Section 1.9) or Extended Hours of Operation of the City Offices prior to the close of business on the day prior to the scheduled disconnection. The City may give a grace period, not to exceed three (3) Business days, for the payment of delinquent payments before disconnecting the Service. Delinquent payments received at the City Offices or placed in the drop box after the close of business on the day prior to the scheduled disconnection may be subject to an administrative fee that must be paid prior to the restoration of Service.

(See Section 1.10) 
5.4  ESTIMATED BILLS 
When the City's Electric department is unable to read the meter for a particular Customer at any regular reading date, the City may render an estimated bill. Reasons for estimating the bill could include: 
a.  Discovery of inoperable or defective meters as covered in Section 10, 
b.  Significantly varying readings from past electric consumption, or 
c.  The area in which the meter is located is not accessible in a reasonably safe way. 
In the case of varying readings from past readings, an investigation into the reason for such variations will be made at Customer's request as per Section 10.4. 
5.5  RETURNED CHECKS 
Checks given in payment for Utility Services, Customer Deposits, or reconnection charges which are returned to the City unpaid by the Customer's Bank, will result in an additional returned check charge per check, per occurrence (See Appendix 1-Fee Schedule).

(Reference: Section 16) 
5.7  DELINQUENT CHARGE INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT 
The City may make arrangements for installment payments for those Customers who are unable to pay their bill due to unusual or severe circumstances. However, if the Service has been disconnected, the Customer must pay the Reconnection Charges. 
The installment payment agreement constitutes a contract between the Customer and the City, which guarantees payment by the Customer for the amount of the agreement over the specified period. Request for installment payment agreements are subject to City approval and must be approved by the City's billing supervisor or designee. 
Failure of the Customer to meet the conditions of this installment payment agreement including prompt payment of the current bill shall constitute a breach of this agreement and entitles the City to pursue collection and Service termination procedures under the rules and regulations outlined in these Rules and Regulations and the accompanying Tariff. Such a breach will also cause the Customer to become ineligible to make an installment payment arrangement for a period of 12 months. 
5.8  BUDGET BILLING 
A Customer may request for a budget billing and the City reserves the right to establish a budget billing program. Budget billing provides a payment plan which allows Customers to levelize their monthly bills. Any Customer with good credit standing with the City may elect to be placed on budget billing once per calendar year, as long as they are not an assistance-based customer. Under this plan, the Customer will be billed for eleven months on an estimated budget amount basis with the twelfth month as the settlement month. The billing for the settlement month will consist of the actual metered billing for that month plus the difference between the actual amount due to date and the budget amount paid to date. 
In no case will the under-calculation of a projected bill absolve the Budget Billing Customer from paying for the actual amount of consumed energy. If the under collection is too great, then at the option of the City, monthly budget billing amounts can be increased at any time during the eleven month budget billing period. 
If the monthly budget billing is not paid, the Customer will be notified by mail that the monthly budget billing will be terminated unless payment of the balance due is received by the late date. Any Customer who is participating in budget billing will not be eligible for the Delinquent Charge Installment Agreement. If the budget billing is terminated, the current finance charge will be applied to the unpaid balance (See Appendix 1-Fee Schedule). 
5.9  POST-DATED CHECKS 
Post-dated checks will not be accepted until the date of the check. Post-dated checks will not abate imposition of any late charges incurred. 
SECTION 6 - ADMINISTRATION OF SERVICE CLASSIFICATION

The City, upon request, will assist the Customer in the selection of the most advantageous Service Classification, but the duty and responsibility of making the selection shall at all times rest with the Customer. In the event, the Customer fails to select the Service Classification, the City may assign the Service Classification to the Customer and the Customer shall have no recourse to any damages caused by the City's selection, however, the Customer may request a change in its Service Classification. 
6.4  CHANGING SERVICE CLASSIFICATIONS 
When a Customer has selected the Service Classification for his Service, its application shall remain in effect for the contract term which the Service Classification specifies. If a Customer's consumption characteristics change so that they fall within the parameters of a different Service Classification, the City reserves the right to change the Customer's Service Classification at any time. 
6.5  INTERDEPARTMENTAL BILLING 
The City shall bill its internal utility accounts (City Accounts) at the rate for that Customer Class for which the City Account may qualify. The Billing period will be addressed in accordance with the applicable Service Classifications. Rates are stated on a monthly basis and bills are rendered monthly following the supply of Services. 
SECTION 7 - CUSTOMER'S INSTALLATION 
7.1  CUSTOMER'S WIRING 
All of the Customer's wiring and appurtenances shall be furnished, installed and maintained by the Customer. The City shall not be liable for loss or damage resulting from the Customer's wiring or equipment. 
The City may delay the construction of an extension and/or Service until the Applicant (or Applicants) has completed the wiring and installation of equipment necessary to receive and use Service. The Customer's facilities at the Point of Delivery and the Service entrance shall be in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC) 2 [] , the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) [] , and the City's standards for such facilities. 
7.2  DESCRIPTION OF INSTALLATION 
The Customer shall present, in writing, complete specifications of equipment, connected electric loads, location plans, electric vaults, cable runs, substations and other data required, so that the City may advise the character of the Service it will furnish, the point at which it will be connected and metered and any other requirements associated with the special conditions of the Service. 
7.3  ELECTRICAL INSPECTION 
All new wiring and equipment, or changes in wiring and equipment, shall conform to the standards of the National Electrical Code and of local codes in force at the time. 
In no event shall the City be under any obligation to inspect the wiring or appliances of the Applicant. The City may refuse to supply Service to the Applicant if the City believes the wiring or appliances do not comply with the applicable codes and recognized requirements. 
On receipt of a Temporary Cut-in Card issued by a qualified electrical inspection agency and/or a Waiver, at the sole discretion of the City, signed by the property Owner and the Electrician that holds the City harmless, the City may render Service to the Customer on a temporary basis for a period of not more than 10 working days. If a Final Cut-in Card issued by a qualified electrical inspection agency is not received within this 10 day period, the City shall disconnect Service until such is received. 
The City will further render permanent Service only after receipt of an executed Final Cut-in Card stating notice of approval issued by the duly recognized inspection agency.

7.6  MOTORS 
The City shall always be consulted with regard to the requirements as to the size of motor and starting current limitations as well as voltage and phase of service which will be furnished. The City reserves the right to refuse Service to any size motor where the starting currents are deemed to be excessive at City's sole discretion. Starting currents must be limited by the Customer to acceptable levels. 
7.6.A  MOTORS, GENERAL 
It is characteristic of most electric motors, large welding machines and arc furnaces to draw large momentary starting current. This may result in objectionable variations in the voltage supply of other Customers who receive their Service from the same circuits or transformers. In the interest of all of City's Customers, it is therefore necessary for the City to limit the value of starting current which may be drawn by various classes of motors connected to City's lines. 
Some latitude in the permissible starting current of motors may be permitted under certain conditions at City's sole discretion, such as when motors are started very infrequently (once or twice a day), when motors are supplied from large capacity circuits and transformers, when motors are necessarily supplied from individual transformers on the Customer's premises, etc. Limitations will be site specific. 
The City must always be consulted in advance regarding motor installation above 5 horsepower single phase or above 10 horsepower three phase to insure the proposed installation is acceptable to City. 
7.6.B  MOTORS RESIDENTIAL 
Single phase, 120 volt motors will be permitted providing the maximum starting current does not exceed 100 amperes. (Typically 2 HP or 12,000 BTU/hr. air conditioner.) Single phase, 240 volt or 208 volt motors will be permitted, however, when the maximum starting current exceeds 150 amperes, the City shall be contacted for approval before purchasing equipment. A/C and heating equipment exceeding 100 amperes shall be a split-unit type with two or more compressor motors, interlocked so that not more than one motor can start at any one time. Three-phase, 208 volt service normally will not be supplied for residential service. 
7.6.C  MOTORS COMMERCIAL 
When commercial installations are located in areas, which are primarily residential, or rural, they normally will be treated as covered by the above Section on "Motors Residential". The City may refuse single-phase service to motors rated 5 horsepower or more and to poly phase motors rated less than 5 horsepower or to Customers with a total three phase connected motor load less than 6 horsepower. 
7.6.D  MOTORS INDUSTRIAL 
Due to the wide variety of equipment and methods of service, general rules for starting motors cannot be specifically outlined. Additions to existing installations can be made which will not increase the maximum starting current of the installation. In all other cases, the City must be consulted as to the maximum allowable starting currents. 
7.6.E  MOTOR PROTECTIVE DEVICES 
All motors should be provided with devices that will protect the motor and circuit against overload or short circuit in any wire. Refer to the NEC for motor protection details. Motor equipped with reduced voltage starters that cannot be safely subjected to full voltage at starting should be provided with a device to insure that on the failure of the supply voltage, the motor will be disconnected from the line or the starter returned to the "off" position, unless the motor is equipped with automatic restarting means. To prevent unnecessary shutdowns, it is recommended that this starter be equipped with a time delay feature to prevent the starter from dropping out and to permit the motor to continue to operate during a momentary voltage change. 
The direction of phase rotation and the continuity of all three phases of the alternating current supply are carefully maintained, however, the City cannot guarantee against accidental or temporary change of failure thereof. Therefore, motors or other apparatus requiring unchanged phase rotation or continuity of three-phase supply should be equipped, by the Customer, with suitable three-phase protection against the reversal or phase failure. 
7.6.F  WELDERS 
In every case the Customer or Contractor shall consult with the City concerning the electrical supply to electric welders before any commitments for their purchase or installation are made. 
7.6.G  GENERATORS 
No Customer shall install any generation equipment without a written approval from a City's authorized representative. The City must always be consulted concerning the installation of any electric generating equipment. In all cases of emergency standby generation (Non-Cogeneration) a single operated break before make type double throw switch shall be installed between the generator and the Cities supply, to prevent the generator from being connected to the City system at any time. Closed transition switching may be permitted after a Customer and equipment specific evaluation is made by the City. Portable generators may only be used with service conductors physically disconnected from the utility system. 
7.7  RIGHT TO INSPECT 
The City reserves the right, but is not obliged, to inspect any installation either before electricity is introduced or later if it believes there may be unsafe or hazardous conditions. The City also reserves the right to reject any wiring or appliances not in accordance with the City's standard requirements. Even when the City performs an inspection or otherwise, the City shall not be liable for any loss or damages resulting from defects in the installations, appliances, or wiring which may occur on the Customer's premises. 
7.8  PROTECTION FOR COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT 
The Customer shall install, own, and maintain suitable surge, outage, and harmonic protection equipment to protect computers and other sensitive electronic devices. When the Customer has important, sensitive electronic data, the Customer shall be responsible for installing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) equipment to protect the data. The City shall in no way be liable for any damage to the Customer's electronic equipment, computer hardware or software, loss of data associated with the computer hardware and associated equipment, or any other consequential damage due to voltage spikes, surges, or loss of Service. 
7.9  POWER QUALITY 
When an electrical disturbance affects either the City's distribution system or Service to another Customer and the disturbance is found to be due to a specific Customer's installation (such as resulting from load imbalance, the operation of motors, variable speed motor drives, power generator, or other electrical equipment), the Customer causing the disturbance shall discontinue operation of the suspect equipment until suitable corrective wiring or equipment has been implemented on the Customer's premises to eliminate the disturbance. Such corrective action to eliminate the cause of the disturbance shall be made at the Customer's expense. The City shall have the right to inspect and test the Customer's electrical equipment to determine if it has any electrical characteristics which may cause undue disturbance to the City's system or affect the Service to other Customers. The following are the City's guidelines for disturbance types: 
7.9.A  WAVE FORM DISTORTION 
The maximum total wave form distortion caused by the Customer's equipment, including a maximum of 1% phase voltage imbalance, shall be limited to 5% measured at the Point of Delivery. 
7.9.B  HARMONIC DISTORTION 
The total Harmonic Distortion shall not exceed 5% with any single harmonic distortion not exceeding 3% measured at the Customer-City interface. 
7.9.C  COMMUTATION NOTCHES 
Distortion caused by the commutation of solid state devices between conducting and non-conducting conditions in the form of notches on the voltage waveform shall be limited to less than a 3,400% volts-microseconds area under the notch. 
7.9.D  STAGGERED STARTUPS 
During start-up operations, Customer's machinery and equipment shall be started on a serial or staggered schedule with no more than 500 HP per step so as to minimize the impact of such startups on the City's electric system. Such schedule shall be provided to, and approved by the City in advance, and any necessary modifications to the schedule shall be communicated to the City immediately. Between each step, the customer shall provide a time interval of a minimum of fifteen (15.0) minutes, preferably one hour. This time interval helps to reduce the power cost to the Customer and the City. 
7.10  DAMAGE TO CITY'S SYSTEM 
The Customer should ensure that its installation of any facility listed in this Section does not interfere with the City's operations or cause damage to any of the City's facilities. In the event the Customer's installation causes damage to the City's operations or facilities, the Customer shall be responsible for all the costs associated with such damage.

A fair-weather day is defined as a day when, in the opinion of the City, weather conditions permit sufficient opportunity for the required work to be accomplished. 

SECTION 10 - ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES 
10.1  FAST WATT-HOUR METER 
Whenever a watt-hour meter in service is found, upon tests made by the City, to have a positive average error, that is, when it over-registers or is fast, in excess of two percent (2%), the City shall credit or refund to the Customer an amount equal to the excess paid for the kilowatt-hours incorrectly metered. The refund shall be for the period that the Customer received Service through the meter, but for not more than the periods established below: 
10.1.A  KNOWN DATE OF ERROR 
If the date on which the error first developed or occurred can be established or estimated, the bills for Service shall be recalculated from that time. 
10.1.B  UNKNOWN DATE OF ERROR 
If the time at which the error first developed or occurred cannot be established or estimated, it shall be assumed that the over-registration existed for a period of three (3) years or a period equal to one-half of the time since the meter was last tested, whichever is less. The credit or refund will not be issued if it is less than $5.00. 
10.2  SLOW OR STOPPED METER 
When a meter is found, upon test made by the City, to have a negative average error, that is, when it under registers or is slow in excess of two percent (2%), or the meter has stopped working, or in case of a poly phase meter, to be operating with an inactive element, and the error in registration or failure to operate is not attributable to the negligence of the City, but is due to some unpredictable cause, such as lightening or unauthorized overload, the City may estimate the proper charge for the normal periods or by such method as may be determined by the City or its electric consultant. Except in cases of tampering, theft, inaccessibility to meter, or unauthorized overload, such an estimate for a slow or stopped meter may cover a period of not more than three (3) years. 
10.3  DEMAND METER 
Whenever a demand meter, the readings, or indications of which are utilized in computing the charges for Service, is found, upon test by the City to be in error in excess of the limits indicated below, the charges to the Customer shall be adjusted in the same manner as prescribed under watt-hour meters above.

The Customer(s), to be affected by such interruptions will, if possible, be notified twenty-four (24) hours in advance. The Customer may, with justifiable cause, request the City to extend the twenty-four (24) hour notification to forty-eight (48) hours. 
SECTION 12 - CUSTOMER'S USE OF SERVICE 
12.1  RESALE FORBIDDEN 
The Customer shall not directly or indirectly sell, sublet, assign or otherwise dispose of the electric energy or any part therefore except as authorized by Chapter 51, Title 25 of the Delaware Code. 
12.2  FLUCTUATIONS 
Electric Service must not be used by the Customer in such a manner as to cause unusual fluctuations or disturbances in the City's supply system. Should such fluctuation or disturbance be caused by the Customer, the City may discontinue Service or require the Customer to modify his installation or install approved controlling devices (See also Section 7.9). 
Where Service is rendered under Service Classifications "SGS", "MGS", "LGS", "GSP" or "SCS" and the use of current is intermittent or subject to large fluctuations, the City reserves the right to base the measured demand upon a five (5) minute period, or to add to the measured demand, as determined under the measured demand provision of the applicable Service Classification, an amount equal to sixty-five percent (65%) of the rated capacity in kilowatts of apparatus having fluctuating or intermittent current requirements. 
12.3  UNBALANCED LOADS 
Where Service is rendered under Service Classifications "SGS", "MGS", "LGS", "GSP" or "SCS", the Customer shall at all times take and use energy in such manner that the load will be balanced equally between phases. Should this not be possible and the imbalance exceeds ten percent (10%) of the lesser phase, the City reserves the right to compute the demand for billing purposes on the assumption that the load on each phase is equal to that on the greatest phase. If the imbalance exceeds forty percent (40%) of the lesser phase, the City reserves the right to terminate Service. 
12.4  TRANSIENT VOLTAGES 
Customers are cautioned that certain types of data processing equipment are sensitive to transient voltages which typically occur in commercial power systems in routine operation.

12.5  SUPERIMPOSING ELECTRIC SIGNALS ON THE CITY'S ELECTRIC SYSTEM 
When the Customer couples to or superimposes any signal on his electric system for equipment control, load management control, carrier current transmission, signal systems, communication broadcasting or any other purpose, the Customer shall be responsible for preventing any such signals from being imposed upon or entering the City's metering and electric system. The Customer shall notify and obtain the consent of the City before utilizing their equipment. 
12.6  POWER FACTOR 
The average Power Factor at the point where the electric service is metered should not be less than ninety-five percent (95.0%) lagging. 
In any month in which the average lagging Power Factor is less than 95.0%, the measured demand shall be corrected by the ratio of the 95.0% Power Factor to the actual Power Factor as follows: 
Billing Demand = Measured Demand x (95.0) /Customer's Actual Monthly Power Factor) 
In case the actual Power Factor exceeds 95.0%, no correction to the Billing Demand will be made. 
Where lighting, welding, motors or other electrical equipment or devices having lagging or leading Power Factor characteristics are installed, in order to avoid additional charges, the Customer may furnish, install, and maintain at his own expense, corrective apparatus which will increase the average Power Factor of the individual units or the entire installation to not less than 95.0% lagging or more than 110% leading. The City reserves the right to require removal or modification of Customer installed equipment which the City, at its sole discretion determines, is detrimental to the proper operation of the City's electric distribution system. 
12.7  USE OTHER THAN STATED IN CONTRACT 
The City's Service shall not be used for any purpose or in any place other than that stipulated in the Customer's contract for Service except by written consent of the City. 
12.8  CHARACTERISTICS OF SERVICE 
The Service specified and furnished by the City consists of sixty (60) hertz, single phase or three-phase alternating current at one standard primary or secondary voltage. The type of Service (number of phases and voltage) available varies with location and load. 
An Applicant must contact the City to ascertain the type of Service the City will supply before making plans for receiving Service or making alterations to existing Service. 
Secondary Service - Single phase or three phase circuits carrying a nominal voltage of 480 volts or less between any two conductors. 
Primary Service - Single phase or three phase circuit carrying a nominal voltage of 14,400 volts to 24,900 volts between any two conductors. This Service is available to customers, with the City's approval, who have anticipated loads in excess of 750 Kw. 
12.9  CHANGE OF INSTALLATION AND SERVICE OVERLOAD 
The Customer shall give immediate written notice to the City of any proposed substantial increase or decrease in, or change of purpose or location of his installation. The Service connection, transformers, meters and equipment supplied by the City for each Customer have a definite capacity and no additions to the equipment or load connected thereto will be permitted except by written consent of the City. Failure to give notice of additions or changes in load or location shall render the Customer liable for any damage to the meters or their auxiliary apparatus or the transformers or wires of the City caused by the additional or changed installations. 
12.10  LIMITATION OF USE 
No other source of Service shall be introduced or permitted, directly or indirectly, for the Customer's use without written notice to the City and written consent of the City which shall not be unreasonably withheld. An installation for which permission has been granted must be made so that the supply of power from the Customer's generator or other sources cannot feed into the City's system, unless agreed to by a written contract between the City and the Customer.

Such notice to disconnect prior to the expiration of a contract term will not relieve the Customer from any minimum or guaranteed payment under any contract or Service or Rate Classification. With a written Notice to the City, the Owner of a property may keep the Service connected after the Service to a tenant is discontinued. 
17.2  COMPLETION OF TERM 
If, by reason of any act, neglect or default of a Customer or his agent, the City's Service is suspended, or the City is prevented from supplying Service in accordance with the terms of any contract it may have entered into, the minimum charge for the unexpired portion of the contract term shall become due and payable immediately as liquidated damages in lieu of the anticipated returns from the said contract.

1.  PURPOSE 
The purpose of this Economic Development Rate (EDR) is to provide a discount from the City's regular tariffs rates for Service to certain new and existing commercial and industrial Customers of the City if they make substantial new capital investments or create new employment opportunities and, in doing so, add or retain load in the City's Service territory. 
2.  AVAILABILITY 
Customers to whom EDR is available are: (1) Customers eligible for or taking Service from the City under Service Classifications "MGS", "LGS", or "GSP"; (2) Whose operations at a facility in the City's Service territory, for which a discount under this Rate Schedule is sought, fall primarily under Standard Industrial Code classifications 20 through 38, and 60 through 67 except 65; (3) Who apply to the City in writing, for a discount under this Rate; and (4) Who satisfy all other EDR criteria described below. 
Discounts under this Rate are available for New Load associated with either initial permanent Service (a "New Customer") or an expansion of existing Service (an "Expansion Customer") at a single integrated facility. The New Load of a New Expansion Customer must be at least 50 kW with a minimum of 60% load factor and the new Customer must have added at least 25 Investment Units as of the Operational Date. Discounts under this Rate may be available to the existing Customers, with a minimum load of 2,000 kW and a monthly load factor of 60% for enabling them to retain their loads. 
The City shall have sole discretion in determining eligibility for discounts under this Rate, and the availability of such discounts may be limited or discontinued from time to time, as the City determines it is appropriate to do so. Examples of situations where discounts under this Rate are not available include when: (1) the identity of a Customer to whom the City currently provides, or has provided, Service has changed solely due to a name change, purchase, merger, consolidation, or reorganization; (2) A Customer has substituted one Service address in the City's Service territory for another; (3) Strikes, equipment failures, temporary plant shutdowns; or other similar circumstances are what allow the Customer to claim eligibility for discounts under this Rate; or (4) The economic development purpose of this Rate is not being served. 
3.  DEFINITIONS 
3.1  New Load - For a New Customer, New Load is the total Metered Demand and Energy attributable to initial permanent Service. For an Expansion Customer, New Load is the net demand and energy attributable to the expansion, as determined by the City. 
3.2  Investment Unit - An investment Unit is equal to 1 non-seasonal, full-time job or $100,000 in capital investment. 
3.3  Operational Date - The Operational Date for a New or Expansion Customer shall be the first day of full operation of the new or expanded facility. In no event, however, shall the Operational Date be later than 2 years after the New Customer or Expansion Customer applies for the discount available under this Rate. 
4.  DETERMINATION OF THE DISCOUNT 
After the receipt of the Customer's application, the City and the Customer will negotiate the Discount to be given to the Customer for his New Load. The period for which the Discount will be applied will also be negotiated. 
5.  APPLICATION OF DISCOUNT 
The Discount will be applied to the total bill, before the application of the Delaware Utility Tax, for Service of the New Load of the New Customer or Expansion Customer during the periods specified below as long as the New Customer or Expansion Customer remains eligible for the Discount under this Rate. 
6.  SERVICE AGREEMENT 
A New Customer or Expansion Customer shall execute a Service Agreement with the City providing that, for the period during which Discount is provided under this Rate, a minimum of 5 years, the New Customer or Expansion Customer shall purchase its total electric requirements from the City. At the City's sole discretion, a New Customer or Expansion Customer may be able to increase the Discount available under this Rate by executing a Service Agreement providing that the New Customer or Expansion Customer shall purchase its total electric requirements for a longer period commensurate with the amount of the Discount sought. 
7.  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
A New Customer or Expansion Customer must submit a written application to the City for the Discount under this Rate and such application must be approved by the City before the Operational Date. The application must include a description of the amount and source of the New Load and the basis on which the New Customer or Expansion Customer believes itself to be eligible for Discount under this Rate. 
For an Expansion Customer, the City may install metering equipment necessary to measure the Expansion Customer's New Load separately from loads already served by the City. The City reserves the right to determine how such New Load will be metered. If the City determines that separate metering is impractical, unduly expensive, or otherwise unnecessary, the City will administratively determine the New Load eligible for Discount under this Rate and the City's determination will be controlling. 
New Customers or Expansion Customers will give the City access to information reasonably required by the City to determine continuing eligibility. Unless expressly altered by this Rate, the terms and conditions of Service to a New Customer or an Expansion Customer will be governed by the Tariff and Service Agreement under which the City provides Service to the New Customer or Expansion Customer. 
Incremental transmission and distribution investment costs associated with specifically serving a Customer who otherwise qualifies for this rate will be separately recovered from the Customer. 
8.  LOSS OR REDUCTION OF NEW LOAD 
If during the initial term of its Service Agreement with the City, the New Customer or Expansion Customer ceases or substantially reduces its operations at the facility where Discount has been provided for New Load under this Rate, a New Customer or Expansion Customer will refund to the City Discounts provided under this Rate. A substantial reduction in operations shall be deemed to have occurred where the New Load of the New Customer or Expansion Customer falls below 50 kW for a period of 3 or more months. A substantial reduction in operations also shall be deemed to have occurred where the energy usage of the New Customer or the Expansion Customer in 6 consecutive months is 25% or more below the energy usage in the same billing months of the prior year. 
Such refunds shall be equal to the Discounts actually received by the Customer on that portion of load that is lost or reduced, as determined by comparing bills for Service with and without the Discount provided under this Rate. Refunds shall be due and payable in full within 30 days after the City renders a bill for such refunds.

In the event that an existing Extra Facility must be modified or replaced, whether or not such modification or replacement is requested by the affected Extra Facility Customer, then the installed cost of Extra Facilities on which the monthly Extra Facilities Charge is based shall be the installed cost of existing equipment, plus the installed cost of new additions, less the installed cost of equipment removed. The installed cost of existing equipment shall be the same installed cost used for the said equipment immediately prior to the modification or replacement. The installed cost of new additions shall be the current market price of the said new additions at the time the new additions are installed. The installed cost of equipment removed shall be the same installed cost used for the said equipment immediately prior to removal.

A Generator Owner shall make a formal application to the City for the interconnection of a generator to the City system. The application will be made on an Application Form provided by the City. Two Application Forms are available at the City's Office. Generators 25kw or less will use the shorter Application Form as less technical data is needed for units within this size range. Larger size Generators shall use the other Application Form. 
6.  DESIGNATION OF COMPANY CONTACT PERSONS FOR MATTERS RELATING TO DISTRIBUTED GENERATION INTERCONNECTION 
The City's Electric Department will be the designated point of contact for all matters related to interconnected generation. The City will maintain records concerning applications received for interconnection and parallel operation of Distributed Generation. Such records will include the date of receipt of each such application, documents generated in the course of processing such applications, correspondence regarding such applications and the final disposition of such application. 
7.  PRE-INTERCONNECTION STUDIES 
A.  In many instances the City will wish to conduct a service study, coordination study, or facilities impact study prior to interconnection of a Distributed Generation unit. In instances where such studies are deemed necessary, the scope of such studies shall be based on the characteristics of the particular Distributed Generation unit to be interconnected and the proposed point of interconnection. 
B.  A Generator Owner who qualifies under the special NMS Rider Tariff and all generators less than 25kW are exempt from the pre-interconnection study requirement. 
C.  Completion of Pre-interconnection Study - Upon completion of the interconnection study, the City will notify the Generator Owner that his application has been approved or indicate insufficient detail why the application cannot be approved. The conducting of such pre-interconnection studies shall not unduly delay the interconnection of the Distributed Generation. In no event will such studies take longer to complete than 4 weeks after receipt of signed Customer application and Customer submittal of all required data. 
D.  Pre-interconnection Study Fee - The City will perform a pre-interconnection study without charge up to the typical and customary cost that the City would expend for the study work of similar type of Customer interconnection. If the cost to the City is expected to exceed this typical and customary amount, or if multiple submittals by the Generator Owner are necessary, the City will advise the Generator Owner of the expected cost of such study work by the City before such work begins. The Generator Owner will be responsible for payment of all costs above the typical and customary amount. 
8.  NETWORK INTERCONNECTION OF DISTRIBUTED GENERATION 
Where generation is to be connected to a network system and capable of exporting power to the Grid, the interconnection study may result in more stringent interconnection requirements. 
9.  PRE-APPROVAL OF GENERATION UNITS, DEVICES AND SYSTEMS 
Upon approval by the City that certain generating unit's protective devices and/or system(s) meet the standards set out in these guidelines, such approval shall be made available to the appropriate manufacturer upon written request. For subsequent applications using some or all of the identical generating unit's protective devices and/or systems, the manufacturer may submit a copy of the approval with the application as proof that its equipment has already been approved for use on the City's system. Use of pre-approved equipment will not eliminate any applicable requirement for a pre-interconnection study to determine the suitability of the equipment for each application, given the unique arrangements and characteristics of both the Generator Owner and the City systems at the point of the interconnection. 
10.  CONNECTION APPROVAL 
The Generator Owner can connect their generation to the City System only after the Interconnection Application has been approved and the Generation Owner has received a written approval notification. The City will provide notification within four weeks after the receipt of the Interconnection Application and all required data. 
11.  INTERCONNECTED GENERATION SITE WARNING LABEL 
The Generator Owner shall install a warning label in a conspicuous place on their electric meter or meter box to notify the City personnel that there is a generator source installed on the load side of the meter. The warning label shall not be placed in a location that would interfere with the ability of the City personnel to read the electric meter. The City will provide the warning label to the Generator Owner. The warning label must be placed before the generation can be interconnected. 
12.  DISCONNECTION AND RECONNECTION 
The City may disconnect a Distributed Generation unit under the following conditions: 
A.  Application Termination - Upon termination of the approved Interconnection Application. 
B.  Non Compliance - For non-compliance with the technical guidelines specified in this document or other requirement contained in the applicable Tariff, provided that the City has given notice to the Generator Owner and provided the Generator Owner reasonable time (consistent with the condition) to correct such non-compliance. The City will reconnect the unit only upon receipt of certification from the Generator Owner and verification by the City that the unit is in compliance. The City will provide verification within a reasonable time period. 
C.  In Case of a system emergency outage of the City's primary Electrical Sources - The Generator Owner's generation equipment must be installed and configured so that parallel operation must automatically cease immediately and automatically during outages or loss of the City's electric source in accordance with these guidelines. The Generation Owner must also cease parallel operation upon notification by the City of a system emergency, abnormal condition or in cases where such operation is determined to be unsafe, interferes with the supply of service to other Customers or interferes with the City's system maintenance or operation. In addition, the City may disconnect the generator from the system for system emergencies without notice. However, the City will use reasonable efforts to notify the Generation Owner prior to disconnecting. 
D.  For Routine Maintenance and Repairs - The City may disconnect a Customer/Generation Owner for routine maintenance and repairs on the City's system consistent with applicable tariffs and agreements. The City will make reasonable efforts to provide advance notice to the Customer/Generation Owner of service interruptions resulting from routine maintenance. 
E.  The City will reconnect the Customer/Generation Owner as quickly as possible following any such service interruption. 
13.  TERMINATION 
The Generation Owner may terminate the approved Interconnection Application at any time upon thirty (30) days of providing a written notice to the City. The City may terminate the Interconnection Application for a cause after 60 days written notice to the Generator Owner of a material violation of the terms of the approved Interconnection Application and after the Generator Owner has had a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violation. The Generator Owner must give the City notice that it intends to permanently shut down his generation. 
14.  PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING PROPOSED DISTRIBUTED GENERATION PROJECTS 
In the course of processing applications for parallel operation and in the conduct of pre-interconnection studies, the Generation Owner shall provide the City with detailed information concerning the proposed Distributed Generation project. The City shall not use such knowledge of proposed Distributed Generator projects submitted to it for review to prepare competing proposals to the Generator Owner whereby the City, or its affiliate, offers either discounted rates in return for not installing the Distributed Generation, or offers competing Distributed Generation projects. 
15.  TECHNICAL GUIDELINES FOR PARALLEL OPERATION OF ON-SITE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION UNITS 
This subsection describes minimum requirements and procedures for safe and effective connection and operation of Distributed Generation. A Generator Owner may operate 60 Hertz, three phase or single phase generating equipment, whether a QF or non-QF, in parallel with the City's system pursuant to an approved Interconnection Application provided that the equipment and Generator Owner meet or exceed the requirements of these guidelines or the NSM Rider Tariff requirements and that the City has approved the Generator Owner's application to interconnect. This subsection describes typical interconnection requirements. Certain specific interconnection locations and conditions may require the installations of additional protective settings or hardware, especially when exporting power to the system. If the City concludes that an application for parallel operation requires additional protective settings or hardware, the City shall make those requirements known to the Generator Owner within 14 days after all pertinent studies are completed. 
16.  APPROVAL FOR INTERCONNECTION 
Approval to connect to the City system indicates only that the minimum requirements for a safe proper interconnection have been satisfied. Such approval does not imply that the Generator Owner's facility meets all federal, state and local standards or regulations. 
A.  GENERAL INTERCONNECTION AND PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS 
1.  The Generator Owner's generation and interconnection installation must meet all applicable national, state, and local construction and safety codes. 
a.  The Generator Owner's generator shall be equipped with protective hardware and software designed to prevent the generator from energizing one of the City's de-energized circuits. The Generator Owner's generator must automatically disconnect from the City's system if the Grid source is lost, irrespectively of connect loads or other generators. 
b.  The generator shall be equipped with the necessary protective hardware and software designed to prevent sustained parallel operation of the generating equipment with the City's system unless the system service voltage and frequency are within acceptable magnitudes as defined in Section 15. 
c.  Pre-approved equipment shall be accepted as part of an interconnection proposal without the need to re-review the equipment itself. However, the application, design and setting of pre-approved units and/or equipment must be reviewed and coordinated according to the unique needs of the specific location of the proposed installation. Where a complete unit or system has been pre-approved, only location-specific issues will typically need to be reviewed. 
d.  The Generator Owner shall be responsible for protecting its own generating and interconnection equipment in such a manner so that City system outages, short circuits, single phasing conditions or other disturbances including zero sequence currents and Ferro resonant over-voltages do not damage the Generator Owner's generating equipment. The protective equipment shall also prevent excessive or unnecessary tripping that would adversely affect the City's service reliability to other Generator Owners and Customers. 
e.  The generator and interface protection schemes shall be continuously monitored and functioning and the generator shall immediately disconnect from the City's system for any condition that would make the protection scheme inoperable. 
f.  The operating power required for the protection and control schemes for the generator and the control power used to disconnect the generator from the City must not be dependent on the City grid power. 
g.  Where multiple generators are connected to the system through a single point of common coupling, the sum of the ratings of the generators will be used to determine the applicability of these guidelines. Protection scheme performance with one or more units off line will have to be considered. 
h.  Applicable circuit breakers or other interrupting devices at the Generator Owner's facility must be capable of interrupting the maximum available fault current at the site, including any contribution from the Owner's generator(s). 
i.  The Generator Owner will furnish and install a manual disconnect device which, when opened, will have the effect of isolating the generator from the City's system. The disconnect device shall have a visual break (a disconnect switch, a draw-out breaker, fuse block, etc. as appropriate to the voltage level), will, at times, be accessible to the City's personnel, and shall be capable of being locked in the open position via a City padlock. The City shall use reasonable efforts to utilize padlocks of a size consistent with typical manufacturer's specifications. The Generator Owner shall follow the City's switching, clearance and tagging procedures which the City shall provide and attach the Warning Label noted in Section 11. 
(1)  On generation installations of 25kW or less, the Generator Owner may elect not to install a manual disconnect switch provided that the meter can be safely "pulled" by the City to isolate the generation equipment from the City's System. If the Generator Owner elects not to install a manual disconnect device, the Generator Owner assumes all risks and consequences when a meter must be "pulled" to disconnect the generator thereby also interrupting electric service to the Customer. 
j.  The design, procurement, installation, and maintenance of the equipment at the Generator Owner's site is the responsibility of the Generator Owner and at the Generator Owner's expense. 
k.  Any necessary enhancements or improvements needed within the City's system and/or at the Customer sites to accommodate the parallel interconnection of the Generator Owner's generation will be at the Generator Owner's expense. 
l.  The Generator Owner has full responsibility and liability for the safe and proper operation of their equipment and the power originating from their generator. The Generator Owner is also responsible for synchronizing their generator(s) with the City's system and maintaining a synchronous operation. 
m.  The Generator Owner must immediately cease parallel operation upon notification by the City if such operation is determined to be unsafe, interferes with the supply of service to other Customers, or interferes with the City's system maintenance or operation. 
n.  The City reserves the right to specify the type of transformer connection (e.g. delta-delta, wye-delta, wye-wye) that will be employed for all multiphase interface transformers consistent, where reasonable, with the Generator Owner's power system. 
B.  PREVENTION OF GENERATOR OWNER GENERATION INTERFERENCE WITH CITY SYSTEM. 
To eliminate undesirable interface caused by operation of the Generator Owner's generating equipment, the Generator Owner's generator shall meet the following criteria: 
1.  Voltage - The generating equipment will be operated in such a manner that the voltage levels on the City's system are in the same range as if the generating equipment were not connected to the City's system. The Generator Owner shall provide an automatic method of initiating a disconnect sequence of his generating equipment from the City system with set points noted in the table below. 
Generating Systems with 
Inverters Up to 25kw Generating Systems with 
Inverters Greater than 25kw Non-Inverter or Rotating 
Machine Generating Systems ·Trip in 0.1 second for <50% 
·Trip in 2 second for 50%=V<88% 
·Trip in 2 seconds for 06%<V<137% 
·Trip in 0.03 second for 137%=V 
(Above times and voltages taken directly from IEEE 929) ·Trip in 0.1 second for V <50% 
·Trip within 0.1 to 30 seconds for 50%=V<88% 
  ·Trip within 0.1 to 30 seconds for 106%<V<137% 
  ·Trip in 0.03 second for 137%=V 
(Specific voltage and time delay set points will be determined for each installation.) ·Trip in 0.1 second for V=115% 
·Trip within 0.1 to 30 seconds for V>110% or V<90% 
(Specific voltage and time delay set points will be determined for each installation.)  
Note: Trip time refers to the time between when the abnormal voltage condition occurs and the generator being disconnected from the utility Company. 
2.  On three phase generator installations, full three phase voltage sensing should be employed. Voltages must be sensed on the high side of any interface transformer if the transformer high voltage winding is ungrounded. 
3.  The Generator Owner may reconnect to the grid when the system voltage returns to normal range and is stabilized as defined in Section III, Definitions. 
4.  Flicker - The Generator Owner shall not cause excessive voltage flicker on the company's system. This flicker shall not exceed the "Borderline of Irritation" curve, Fig. 10.3, as define in IEEE Std 519-1992, Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems. Lower levels of flicker may be required in areas where equipment such as computers and instrumentation are impacted. 
5.  Frequency - The operating frequency of the generating equipment shall not deviate more than the values noted in the table below. 
Generating Systems with 
Inverters Up to 25kw Generating Systems with 
Inverters Greater than 25kw Non-Inverter or Rotating 
Machine Generating Systems · Trip in 0.1 second for F<59.3 Hz 
· Trip in 0.1 second for F>60.5 Hz 
· (Set points taken from IEEE 929) · Trip in 0.1 second for F<59.3 Hz 
· Trip in 0.1 second for F>60.5 Hz 
(Other frequency and time delay set points may be necessary for a specific installation.) · Trip in 0.1 second for <59.3 Hz 
· Trip in 0.1 second for F>60.5 Hz 
(Other frequency and time delay set points may be necessary for a specific installation.)  
Note: Trip time refers to the time between when the abnormal frequency condition occurs and the generator being disconnected from the City. 
6.  The Generator Owner may reconnect when the system frequency returns to normal range and is stabilized as defined in Section III, Definitions. 
7.  Harmonics - Non-linear circuit elements such as inverters can produce harmonics. Per IEEE Std 519, Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems, Table 11.1, the total harmonic distortion (THD) voltage shall not exceed 5% of the fundamental 60 Hz frequency nor 3% of the fundamental for any individual harmonic as measured at the location where the Customer interfaces with the City's system (Point of Common Coupling). In addition, the level of harmonic current that the Customer is allowed to inject into the City's system shall not exceed that specified in Table 10.3 in IEEE Std 519. Furthermore, any commutation notch should be limited as defined by Table 10.2 in IEEE Std 519. The preceding requirements apply to all types of generation systems. 
8.  The Generator Owner is responsible for the installation of any necessary controls or hardware to limit the voltage and current harmonics generated by his equipment to defined levels. 
9.  Power Factor - The generator must not adversely impact the power factor of the Generator Owner site. Most inverters are designed to operate close to unity power factor. The operating power factor of the generator shall be contained within the limits defined in the table below. 
Generating Systems with 
Inverters Up to 25kw Generating Systems with 
Inverters Greater than 25kw Non-Inverter or Rotating 
Machine Generating Systems 0.85 Lagging or Leading when output exceeds 10% of inverter rating. 
(From IEEE 929-1999) 0.85 Lagging or Leading 
When output exceeds 10%of inverter rating. 
Rating 0.85 Lagging or Leading  
10.  To the extent that a Generator Owner's power factor at the Point of Common Coupling falls below 0.9 lagging as a direct result of the installation of the generating unit(s), the Generator Owner must obtain, install and maintain, at his expense, corrective apparatus that compensates for the drop in power factor caused by the installation of the generator. 
11.  Current - In some cases, directional over-current protection may be required to limit fault current flowing onto the Grid in the event of a line fault. DC inverters that are incapable of producing fault current do not require directional over-current protection. 
12.  Inverter systems should not inject DC current greater than 0.5% of rated inverter output in the AC interface point under either normal or abnormal conditions. 
13.  Fault and Line Clearing - The Generator Owner shall automatically disconnect from the City's system during electrical faults on the City's electrical system and upon loss of the City's electric source. The Generator Owner may reconnect when the system voltage and frequency return to normal range and is stabilized as defined in Section III, Definitions. Detection of the loss of the City's primary electric system, where the Generator Owner is operating in an island with other Customer load, becomes increasingly difficult as the level of dispersed generation on a feeder approaches the connected load. For generating units 25kw and below, the over/under voltage and over/under frequency settings described previously along with the anti-islandizing provisions of IEEE 929/UL 1746 inverters, should be sufficient to satisfy this provision. For units greater than 25kw the voltage and frequency set-points are to be adjustable, with the actual setting determined by the City based on the electrical characteristics of the generator and the City's electrical system. In addition, additional protection such as power directional or directional overcurrent functions may be required. For units 500kw or larger, a direct tripping scheme to trip the generator upon loss of the City's feeder may be required by the City. This decision will be based on the saturation of Distributed Generation on a particular feeder circuit and in those cases where under voltage or under frequency sensing may not adequately detect loss of the City source. 
14.  Automatic Reclosing - The Generator Owner is responsible for protecting his equipment from the effects of switching or automatic reclosing of the City's feeder circuit. The Generator Owner may request the City to delay high speed reclosing on the City's feeder to allow the interconnected generator sufficient time to remove itself from an islandized or de-energized feeder prior to automatic reclose. Since delaying the automatic reclose time degrades the level of service provided to other Customers on the circuit, the City will limit the automatic reclose time delays to a few seconds or less. The Generator Owner may also request that a direct transfer trip scheme be added to remove the interconnected Generator from service prior to automatic reclosing by using communications equipment between the generator site and the City. Similarly the Generation Owner may request that a synchronizing check, or reclose blocking scheme be installed on the City's feeder to prevent out of phase reclosing. The Generation Owner is responsible for all costs associated with the installation and maintenance of these requested modifications. 
C.  CONTROL, PROTECTION AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO GENERATORS OF 25 KW OR LESS. 
1.  All Generators 10 kW or less can be single phase. Customer owned generators greater than 10 kW must be evaluated by the City to determine if it can be single phase. The following table describes necessary control, protection and safety equipment specific to generator of 25 kW or less connected to Secondary or Primary Voltage Systems: 
a.  Control, Protection and Safety Equipment for Generators of 25 kW 1 or Less Connected to Secondary or Primary System. 
Generator Size 25kW or less Generator Disconnect Device 2 X Over-Current Trip X Over-Voltage Trip X Under Voltage Trip X Over/Under Frequency Trip X Synchronizing Check 3 Manual or Automatic  
Notes: 
1)  Exporting to the City system many require additional operational/protection devices. 
2)  Generator Owner may elect to have the meter act as the disconnect device. 
(See XIV.A.10) 
3)  For synchronous and other type of generators with stand-alone capability. 
D.  CONTROL, PROTECTION AND SAFETY REQUIREMENT SPECIFIC TO THREE PHASE SYNCHRONOUS GENERATORS, INDUCTION GENERATORS, AND INVERTER SYSTEMS. 
1.  Generators greater than 25 kW must be three phase machines connected to three phase circuits. 
a.  Three Phase Synchronous Generators. Generator circuit breakers shall be three phase devices with electronic or electromechanical control. The Generation Owner is solely responsible for properly synchronizing his generator with the City's system. For a synchronous generator, the excitation system response ratio shall not be less than 0.5 (five-tenth). The generator's excitation system(s) shall confirm, as near as reasonably achievable, to the field voltage vs. time criteria specified in American National Standards Institute Standard C50.13-1989 in order to permit adequate field forcing during transient conditions. 
b.  Three Phase Induction Generators and Inverter Systems. Induction generation may be connected and brought up to synchronous speed (as an induction motor) if it can be demonstrated that the initial voltage drop measured on the City's side at the point of common coupling is within the visible flicker limits stated in Section XIV.B.2. Otherwise, the Generator Owner may be required to install hardware to other techniques to bring voltage fluctuations to acceptable levels. Line-commutated inverters do not require synchronizing equipment. Self-commutated inverters whether of the utility-interactive type or stand-alone type shall be used in parallel with the City system only with synchronizing equipment.

Notes: 
1)  Exporting to the City's system may require additional operating/protection devices and will require coordination of operations with the City. 
2)  For installations of 25kW or less, the Generation Owner may elect to have the meter act as the disconnect device. (See XIV.A.10) 
3)  Selection depends on grounding system, if required, by the City. 
4)  For synchronous and other types of generators with stand-alone capability. 
5)  To be determined on a site specific basis. The relay will operate if the power flow from the generator into the Grid exceeds a predetermined level. A time delay will have to be incorporated into this relay to prevent it from operating during synchronous swings. 
6)  May be required as part of any necessary transfer tripping/reclose blocking protection scheme. 
E.  REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO GENERATORS PARALLELING FOR 0.1 SECOND OR LESS (CLOSED TRANSITION SWITCHING) 
1.  The table below shows the protective functions required by this requirement for generators less than 1 MW which parallel with the City's system for 0.1 second or less such as during source or load transfers.

Notes: 
1)  For synchronous and other types of generators with stand-alone capability. 
2)  Scheme will trip generator if closed transition parallel mode remains in effect longer than 0.1 second. Reverse power relay and current transformer may be required by the City. 
F.  INVERTER TYPE 
DC Generation installations using inverters for interconnection with the City must use non-islanding type inverters as defined in IEEE 929, IEEE Recommended Practices for Utility Interface of Photovoltaic (PV) Systems (including Annex B, D, E, and G) and UL Subject 1741, May 1999, Standard for Static Inverters and Charge Controllers for use in Photovoltaic Power Systems. 
G.  INSPECTION AND START-UP TESTING 
The Generator Owner shall provide the City with reasonable prior notice at least 2 weeks before the initial energizing and start-up testing of the Generator Owner's generating equipment and the City, at its discretion, shall witness the testing of any equipment and protective systems associated with the interconnection. The Generator Owner shall revise and re-submit the application information for any proposed modification that may affect the safe and reliable operation of the City's system. The generator may be reconnected to the City system only after the modified application has been reviewed, testing has been confirmed and the City has given approval to reconnect. 
H.  SITE TESTING AND COMMISSIONING 
Testing of protection systems shall include procedures to functionally test all protective elements of the installation up to and including tripping of the generator and interconnection point. Testing and testing intervals should be in accordance with manufacturers' and industry recommendations. Testing will verify all protective set points and relay/breaker trip timing. The City may witness the testing of installed switchgear, protection systems, and generator. The Generator Owner is responsible for all maintenance of the generator, control and protective equipment. The Generator Owner will maintain records of such maintenance activities which the City may review at reasonable times. For generation systems greater than 500 kW, a log of generator operations may be required in order to determine its output and run times for system planning purposes. 
I.  METERING 
Metering requirements will be reviewed on each specific installation. 
J.  DEDICATED TRANSFORMER 
A dedicated transformer will be required where the Generator Owner is served from the same transformer secondary as another City's Customer and inverter-based technology not meeting IEEE 929-1999 and IEEE 519-1992 specifications is used. In addition, a dedicated transformer or other current-limiting device is needed for any type of generator installation where the increase in available short circuit current could adversely impact other City's Customers on the same secondary circuit. 
K.  SUGGESTED REFERENCES 
The following references can supply technical support and insight into the safe, reliable interconnection of Distributed Generation with the City's systems. These references should be reviewed by those individuals or firms contemplating parallel operation of generation with the City.

1.  AVAILABILITY 
This Net Metering Service (NMS) Rider is available to all Customers, including all Farm Customers, who own their renewable power generation resource(s) (Customer Generator). The primary intent of this installation is to offset part or all of the Customer's own electricity requirements. Capacity under the NMS Rider cannot be more than 25 kilowatts for Residential Customers, 100 kilowatts for Farm Customers or usage for farming activities and 500 kilowatts for all other non-Residential Customers. The primary source of fuel must be solar, wind, hydro, fuel cell, gas from anaerobic digestion of organic material or another approved source of renewable energy which must be located at the Customer's premises for which the Customer is using the NMS Rider. The NMS Rider is applicable to a Customer-Generator interconnected and operated in parallel with the City's transmission and/or distribution facilities. Application for the installation of a Customer Generator system in excess of the above specified limitations, but not to exceed 2 megawatts, may be considered at the City's sole discretion and shall be made under a special contract. 
Any Customer who elects the NMS Rider must apply by filling out the Generation Interconnection Application at least 60 days in advance of the proposed activation date. Approval of the application by the City must be granted prior to activation of the electric generation facility. 
If the total generating capacity of all Customer Generators using NMS served by the City exceeds five percent (5.0%) of the capacity necessary to meet the City's aggregated Customers monthly peak demand for a particular calendar year, the City may elect not to provide the NMS to any additional Customer-Generators. 
2.  APPLICATION FOR THE NMS RIDER 
Any Customer who elects the NMS Rider must apply by filling out the Generation Interconnection Application at least 60 days in advance of the proposed activation date. The Application must include the generator size, type, manufacturer and manufacturer specifications of all components of the electric generation facility. Approval of the application by the City must be granted prior to activation of the Customer Generator. 
3.  CONNECTION TO THE CITY'S SYSTEM 
A.  The Customer Generator cannot be connected to the City's system unless it meets all applicable safety and performance standards set forth by the following: The Technical Considerations Covering Parallel Operations of Customer Owned Generation dated January 1, 2007, National Electric Safety Code, Underwriters Laboratories, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, North America Electric Reliability Council ("NERC") and the City's Electric Service Handbook. Special Attention should be given to the National Electric Code Sections 690 and 705. The Customer must, at his expense, obtain any and all necessary permits, inspections, and approvals required by any local public authorities and any other governing regulations in effect at that time. All the interconnection with the City's System shall be either done by the City or has to be approved by the City. 
B.  The Customer Generator must be installed and configured so that parallel operation must cease immediately and automatically during system outages or loss of the City's primary power supply. The Customer must also cease parallel operation upon notification by the City of a system emergency, abnormal condition, or in cases where such operation is determined to be unsafe, interferes with the City's supply of service to other Customers, or with the operation or maintenance of the City's system. Customer Generator system and equipment that comply with the above listed codes and standards shall be deemed to have generally complied with these requirements. 
1.  If it is necessary for the City to extend or modify portions of its systems to accommodate the delivery of electricity from the Customer Generator, such extension or modification shall be performed by the City at the Customer's expense. For new Customers, such expense shall be determined by the difference between the total cost and the investment the City would make to install a normal service without the Customer Generator. 
4.  DELIVERED VOLTAGE 
The delivered voltage and delivery point of the Customer Generator shall be at the same delivered voltage and delivery point that would be supplied by the City if the Customer purchased all of its electricity from the City. 
5.  CONTRACT TERM 
The contract term shall be the same as the Customer's applicable Rate Schedule or Service Classification. 
6.  RATE 
A.  The monthly billing shall be as stated in the Rate Schedule applicable to the Customer. Under the NMS Rider, only the per kWh charge component billed for electricity delivered by the Customer is affected. The Customer will pay for all kWh delivered by the City to the Customer. If the Customer has delivered electricity to the City system, the City will provide for Customers to be credited in kilowatt hours valued at an amount per kilowatt hour equal to the sum of Delivery Service charges and Supply Service charges for Residential Customers, and the sum of the volumetric energy (kWh) components of the Delivery Service charges and Supply Service charges for non-Residential Customers for any excess energy production of their generating facility that exceeds the Customer's on-site consumption of kWh in a billing period. Excess kWh credits shall be credited to subsequent billing periods to offset a Customer's consumption in those billing periods. At the end of the calendar year, a Customer may request a payment from the City for any excess kWh credit. The payment will be calculated by multiplying the excess kWh credits by the Supply Service rate applicable to the Customer. The Customer-generator retains ownership of Renewable Energy Credits (REC) associated with electric energy produced and consumed by the Customer-generator. 
B.  Supply Service Charge and Supply Service Rate - This charge shall be used at the end of an annualized billing period in a calculation to pay Net Energy Metering ("NEM") customers who request payment for any regulatory defined and eligible excess kWh credits. The payment for residential customer accounts shall be calculated by multiplying the excess kWh credits by the Customer's Supply Service Charges based on a weighted average of the first block of the summer (June through September) and winter Supply Service Charges (October through May) in effect at the end of the Customer's Annualized Billing Period and the preceding 11 billing periods, excluding non-volumetric charges, such as the transmission capacity charge and/or demand charges. The payment for nonresidential customer accounts shall be calculated by multiplying the excess kWh credits by the Customer's Supply Service Charges that would otherwise be applicable at the end of the Customer's Annualized Billing Period. A Customer's Supply Service Charge or Supply Service rate shall be calculated using the utility's wholesale rate minus non-volumetric charges. 
7.  METERING 
An electric meter service will be installed at the Customer's location to measure the energy consumed and the energy delivered to the City system. The City will furnish, install, maintain, and own all metering equipment. Cost will be determined under the Additional Costs and Responsibilities clause below. 
8.  ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Customer will be required to pay for any additional transmission and distribution costs, the cost of metering, transformation, system protection, and any related safety/protective equipment in excess of what would normally be paid for by the City. Protective equipment will be installed by the Customer to provide safety for personnel, provide adequate protection for the City's electric utility system and to the Customer's property, and to prevent any interference with the City's supply of energy to the City's Customers. This equipment will be owned, installed, and maintained by the Customer at its own expense. 
9.  FAILURE TO COMPLY 
The City may disconnect the Customer Service from the City's electric system if the Customer fails to comply with any of the provisions of the NMS Rider. The City also retains the right to disconnect the Customer Generator if it interferes with the City's Service or is poses a safety risks to the City's electric system. The Customer shall also be responsible for all the penalties and costs caused by Customer's failure to comply with this Section. 
10.  RULES AND REGULATIONS 
All the City's applicable Rules and Regulations shall apply to the Service rendered under this NMS Rider. All minimum billings, charges for kWh, kW, Purchased Power Cost Adjustment, General Cost Adjustment, Public Utility Tax, Renewal Energy Charge, etc. will be covered under the applicable Rate Schedule.
