are promulgated to establish responsibility for the treatment, removal and
cleanup of hazardous substance spills within the City limits.
36.02 DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this chapter the following terms are
defined:
1. “Cleanup” means actions necessary to contain, collect, control,
identify, analyze, clean up, treat, disperse, remove or dispose of a
hazardous substance.

imminent or probable spillage, leakage, or release of a hazardous
substance onto the land, into a water of the State or into the atmosphere
which creates an immediate or potential danger to the public health or
safety or to the environment.

36.03 CLEANUP REQUIRED. Whenever a hazardous condition is created
by the deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of a hazardous
substance, so that the hazardous substance or a constituent of the hazardous
substance may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or discharged
into any waters, including ground waters, the responsible person shall cause the
condition to be remedied by a cleanup, as defined in the preceding section, as

reasonable notice, based on the character of the hazardous condition, said notice
setting a deadline for accomplishing the cleanup and stating that the City will
proceed to procure cleanup services and bill the responsible person for all costs
associated with the cleanup if the cleanup is not accomplished within the
deadline. In the event that it is determined that immediate cleanup is necessary
as a result of the present danger to the public health, safety and welfare, then no
notice shall be required and the City may proceed to procure the cleanup and
bill the responsible person for all costs associated with the cleanup. If the bill
for those services is not paid within thirty (30) days, the City Attorney shall
proceed to obtain payment by all legal means. If the cost of the cleanup is

disposing of a hazardous substance shall notify the State Department of
Natural Resources and the Police Chief or the Fire Chief of the

EDITOR’S NOTE
A suggested form of notice for the abatement of nuisances is
included in the appendix of this Code of Ordinances.
Caution is urged in the use of this administrative abatement
procedure, particularly where cost of abatement is more than
minimal or where there is doubt as to whether or not a nuisance
does in fact exist. If compliance is not secured following notice
and hearings, we recommend you review the situation with your
attorney before proceeding with abatement and assessment of
costs. Your attorney may recommend proceedings in court under
Chapter 657 of the Code of Iowa rather than this procedure.

of the installation for the full distance from the termination point of the
presently existing water main to the point where the farthest boundary of
the applicant’s land abuts the street, and the bond shall guarantee the
installation of the water main in as short a time as reasonably possible
and shall further indemnify the City for the cost of completing the
project in the event the applicant fails to complete the project within a

requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load
on the sewage treatment works.
D. Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes
constituting “slugs” as defined herein.
11. Noxious or Malodorous Gases. Any noxious or malodorous gas
or other substance which either singly or by interaction with other wastes
is capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing
entry into sewers for their maintenance and repair.
12. Damaging Substances. Any waters, wastes, materials or
substances which react with water or wastes in the sewer system to
release noxious gases, develop color of undesirable intensity, form
suspended solids in objectionable concentration or create any other
condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
13. Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances
which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage
treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such
degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the
requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
97.05 RESTRICTED DISCHARGES - POWERS. If any waters or wastes
are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which
waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in
Section 97.04 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Superintendent may:
1. Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the
public sewage system;
2. Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sewers;
3. Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates
of discharge; and/or
4. Special Charges. Require payment to cover the added cost of
handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer
charges under the provisions of Chapter 99.
97.06 SPECIAL FACILITIES. If the Superintendent permits the
pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the
CHAPTER 97 USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 517 -
plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Superintendent and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances, and laws. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities
are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at the owner’s expense.
97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES. When required by the Superintendent, the
owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes
shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and
other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling,
and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner
at the owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe
and accessible at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES. All measurements, tests, and analyses of
the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this
chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the
American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In
the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall
be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the
point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out
by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the
sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twentyfour
(24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether
a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D.
and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour
composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab
samples).

APPENDIX “A” TO USER CHARGE ORDINANCE
This appendix presents the methodology used in calculating user charge rates. The
unit costs established are based on estimates of expenses. The actual expenses and
loadings that occur may differ from these estimates and will change as time passes.
Therefore, unit costs must be re-established whenever necessary to reflect actual
expenses and loadings.
Since wastewater treatment costs are primarily dependent on volume of flow and the
discharge strength of all users is substantially equal and approximates the strength of
domestic discharge, the user charge system is based on water usage.

application to the Council for the installation of a sanitary sewer in said street
for the purpose of serving the property in accordance with the following:
1. Application and Deposit. A written request for such installation,
and a sum equal to the cost as estimated by the City of construction from
the point where the sanitary sewer is presently installed and terminates to
the point where the most distant boundary of the owner’s lot abuts the
said public street, shall be submitted to the Council.
2. Construction. Upon receipt of the deposit, the City shall construct
the sanitary sewer for the purpose of serving the property of the
applicant (builder), as soon as such construction can reasonably be
accomplished.
3. Additional Costs. In the event the actual cost to the City of
installation of the sanitary sewer is in excess of the estimated cost, the
builder agrees to reimburse the City for the actual additional cost within
thirty (30) days after the presentation of a bill for such additional cost.
4. Lien Authorized. In the event of the failure of the builder to
reimburse the City, as specified in subsection 3 above, the total of the
additional cost shall be certified to the County Treasurer as a special
assessment lien against the builder’s real estate. In the written request
for installation of the sanitary sewer, the landowner shall waive all

CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 534 -
objections to jurisdiction and rights to notice and consent to the entry of
such a special assessment lien against the real estate.
5. Connecting Property. The expense of connecting the property of
the builder to the sanitary sewer laid in the public street shall be borne by
the builder, in addition to the cost of constructing said sewer, but such
connection shall be under the supervision of the City.
100.04 CONSTRUCTION BY OWNER. In the event an owner of land
abutting or adjoining a public street in which no sewer has been previously
installed desires to construct said sewer at the owner’s own expense, the owner
may do so, after making proper application to the City and receiving a permit to
install such a sewer, in accordance with the following:
1. City Supervision. The installation of such a sewer by a
landowner at the owner’s expense shall be under the strict supervision of
the City and shall, in all ways, conform to the requirements and
specifications of the City.
2. Surety Bond. When making application to the City for a permit to
install such a sewer, the applicant shall post with the City a surety bond,
in an amount to be set by the Council and made a matter of record in the
minutes of the Council, which shall be in an amount equal to but not less
than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the total estimated cost of the
installation for the full distance from the termination point of the
presently existing sewer to the point where the farthest boundary of the
applicant’s land abuts the public street, and the bond shall guarantee the
installation of the sewer in as short a time as reasonably possible and
shall further indemnify the City for the cost of completing the project in
the event the applicant fails to complete the project within a reasonable
time, and shall further indemnify the City for all damages to the public
street incurred in the installation, and shall further hold the City harmless
for any and all other damages arising from the installation of the sanitary
sewer.
3. Ownership of Sewer Line. After the sewer has been installed, it
shall become the property of the City.
100.05 OTHERS REQUIRED TO CONNECT. Following the installation
of a sanitary sewer under the provisions of this chapter, owners of land abutting
or adjoining a public street in which such sewer has been installed, being
persons other than the builder, shall be obliged to connect any sewage
generating facilities into said sanitary sewer, as required by Chapter 95.
100.06 BUILDING SEWERS INSTALLED. Each sanitary sewer
constructed in a public street or right-of-way, whether constructed by the City
CHAPTER 100 SEWER EXTENSIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA

gas of good quality and shall furnish uninterrupted service, except as

happening of the act causing the interruption.

be exclusive.

maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances such as subscriber
taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters, directional couplers),
amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals or other related equipment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, in the event
that all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public
utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are placed
underground after the effective date of this chapter, the Grantee shall only be
required to construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground if it is given reasonable notice and access to
the public utilities’ facilities at the time that such are placed underground.
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 596 -
113.13 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE. The Grantee is hereby
authorized to extend the cable system as necessary, as desirable or as required
pursuant to the terms hereof within the service area. Whenever the Grantee
receives a request for service from at least ten (10) subscribers within 1,320
cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution
cable, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said
subscribers for system extension, other than the usual connection fees for all
subscribers, provided that such extension is technically feasible, and will not
adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market development of the
cable system, or as provided for under Section 113.14 of this chapter.
113.14 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual
circumstances, such as a subscriber’s request to locate the cable drop
underground, existence of more than one hundred fifty (150) feet of distance
from distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers or a density of
less than ten (10) subscribers per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or
distribution cable, cable service or other service may be made available on the
basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material,
labor and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital
contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and subscribers in
the area in which cable service may be expanded, the Grantee will contribute an
amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a
fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential subscribers per
1,320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunk or distribution cable and whose
denominator equals ten (10) subscribers. Potential subscribers will bear the
remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The Grantee
may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction
borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.
113.15 SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The Grantee shall provide
without charge one outlet of basic service to the City’s office building(s), fire
station(s), police station(s) and public school building(s) that are passed by its
cable system. The outlets of basic cable service shall not be used to distribute or
sell cable services in or throughout such buildings, nor shall such outlets be
located in common or public areas open to the public. Users of such outlets shall
hold Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use
of such outlets, including but not limited to those arising from copyright liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the Grantee
shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop line
from the feeder cable to said buildings or premises exceeds one hundred fifty
(150) cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and so long as
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 597 -
it will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition or market
development of the cable system to do so, or unless the appropriate
governmental entity agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in
excess of 150 cable feet. In the event that additional outlets of basic cable
service are provided to such buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual
installation fees associated therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and
materials. Upon request of the Grantee, the building owner may also be
required to pay the service fees associated with the provision of basic cable
service and the additional outlets relating thereto.
113.16 FRANCHISE FEE.
1. The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee equal to five
percent (5%) of gross revenues (as defined herein) received by the
Grantee from the operation of the cable system on a quarterly basis;
provided, however, the Grantee may credit against any such payments:
(a) any tax, fee or assessment of any kind imposed by the City or other
governmental entity on a cable operator or subscriber, or both, solely
because of his or her status as such; (b) any tax, fee or assessment of
general applicability which is unduly discriminatory against cable
operators or subscribers (including any such tax, fee or assessment
imposed, both on utilities and cable operators and their services), and (c)
any other special tax, assessment or fee such as a business, occupation
and entertainment tax. For the purpose of this section, the 3-month
period applicable under the franchise for the computation of the
franchise fee shall begin at the start of the calendar year, unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the City and the Grantee. The
franchise fee payment shall be due and payable sixty (60) days after the
close of the preceding quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a
brief report from a representative of the Grantee showing the basis for
the computation. Upon one hundred twenty (120) days’ prior written
notice, the City may increase the franchise fee up to the maximum
amount allowed by law, but in no event shall the franchise fee exceed
five percent (5%) of the Grantee’s annual gross revenues in the absence
of a maximum amount specified by law. (Ord. 540 – Jul. 09 Supp.)
2. The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable
hereunder shall be ten (10) years from the date on which payment by the
Grantee is due. Unless within ten (10) years from and after said payment
due date the City initiates a lawsuit for recovery of such franchise fee in
a court of competent jurisdiction, such recovery shall be barred, and the
City shall be stopped from asserting any claims whatsoever against the
Grantee relating to any such alleged deficiencies.
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 598 -
113.17 RATES AND CHARGES. The City may not regulate basic cable
service rates to the extent expressly authorized by Federal law. In the event that
basic cable service rate increases are subject to approval of the City, the
Grantee may increase rates relating to the provision of basic cable service by an
amount which is at least equal to the cumulative increase (calculated from the
date of the last basic rate increase) in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban
Consumers – United States Average (CPI) published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.
113.18 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE. The City and the Grantee agree that
any proceedings undertaken by the City that relate to the renewal of the
Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of
Section 626 of the Cable Act (as such existed as of the effective date of the
Cable Act), unless the procedures and substantive protections set forth therein
shall be deemed to be preempted and superseded by the provisions of any
subsequent provision of Federal or State law. In addition to the procedures set
forth in said Section 626(a), the City agrees to notify the Grantee of its
preliminary assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related
community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of the Grantee
under the then current franchise term. The City further agrees that such a
preliminary assessment shall be provided to the Grantee prior to the time that
the four-month period referred to in Subsection (c) of Section 626 is considered
to begin. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the
Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the then current
franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to
comment, the City and Grantee may agree to undertake and finalize
negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise and the City may
grant a renewal thereof. The Grantee and the City consider the terms set forth
in this section to be consistent with the express provisions of Section 626 of the
Cable Act.
113.19 CONDITIONS OF SALE. Except to the extent expressly required
by Federal or State law, if a renewal or extension of Grantee’s franchise is
denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully
acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a
transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party, any such acquisition
or transfer shall be at a fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable
system valued as a going concern. The Grantee and the City agree that in the
case of a lawful revocation of the franchise, at Grantee’s request, which shall be
made in its sole discretion, the Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party. The City
further agrees that during such a period of time it shall authorize the Grantee to
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 599 -
continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise; however, in no
event such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six (6) months
from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time, the
Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its
cable system which is reasonably acceptable to the City, the Grantee and City
may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to Federal or State
law, it being further agreed that the Grantee’s continued operation of its cable
system during the six-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver or an
extinguishment of any rights of either the City or the Grantee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this section, neither the City nor the
Grantee shall be required to violate Federal or State law.
113.20 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE. The Grantee’s right, title or interest
in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise
encumbered, other than to an affiliate, without the prior consent of the City,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be
required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation,
or by assignment of any rights, title or interest of the Grantee in the franchise or
cable system in order to secure indebtedness.
113.21 TESTING FOR COMPLIANCE. The City may perform technical
tests of the cable system during reasonable times and in a manner which does
not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the Grantee
or the cable system in order to determine whether or not the Grantee is in
compliance with the terms hereof and applicable State or Federal laws. Except
in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving the
Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two (2) business days, and
providing a representative of the Grantee an opportunity to be present during
such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has
substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the
reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee. In the event that
such testing demonstrates that Grantee has substantially complied with such
material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the City.
Except in emergency circumstances, the City agrees that such testing shall be
undertaken no more than two (2) times per year in the aggregate, and that the
results thereof shall be made available to the Grantee upon the Grantee’s
request.
113.22 BOOKS AND RECORDS. The Grantee agrees that the City may
review such of its books and records, during normal business hours and on a
nondisruptive basis, as are reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with the
terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public
records required to be kept by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 600 -
of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Grantee
shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature. The City agrees to treat any information
disclosed by the Grantee to it as confidential and only to disclose it to
employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in
order to enforce the provisions hereof.
113.23 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. Grantee shall maintain in full
force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the franchise,
Comprehensive General Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000
combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage. Said insurance
shall designate the City as an additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancelable
except upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the City.
113.24 INDEMNIFICATION. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and
hold harmless and defend the City, its officers, boards and employees, from and
against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from
property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death) which arise out
of the Grantee’s construction, operation or maintenance of its cable system,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
113.25 NOTICE OF VIOLATION. In the event that the City believes that
the Grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, it shall notify the
Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
113.26 GRANTEE’S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND. Grantee shall
have thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice described in Section 113.25: (i)
to respond to the City contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or (ii) to cure
such default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of the default, such default
cannot be cured within the thirty-day period, to initiate reasonable steps to
remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the
projected date that they will be completed.
113.27 PUBLIC HEARING. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to
the notice as described in Section 113.25 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 113.26, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within
sixty (60) days after the Grantee is notified of the alleged default pursuant to
Section 113.26, the City shall schedule a public meeting to investigate the
default. Such public meeting shall be held at the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Council, provided such time is not less than five (5) business
days therefrom. The City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the time and
place of such meeting and provide the Grantee with an opportunity to be heard.
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 601 -
113.28 ENFORCEMENT. Subject to applicable Federal and State law, in
the event the City, after such meeting, determines that the Grantee is in default
of any provision of the franchise, the City may:
1. Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under the
franchise, if any, including without limitation, any bonds or other surety;
provided, however, the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in
such amount as the City reasonably determines is necessary to remedy
the default;
2. Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief;
3. In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
franchise, declare the franchise agreement to be revoked; or
4. Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably
lends itself to such remedy as an alternative to damages.
The Grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly
with any provision of the franchise by reason of any failure of the City to
enforce prompt compliance.
113.29 ACTS OF GOD. The Grantee shall not be held in default or
noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise or suffer any enforcement
or penalty relating thereto where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are
caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages or other events reasonably
beyond its ability to control.
113.30 UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION. In addition to those criminal and
civil remedies provided by State and Federal law, it is a misdemeanor for any
person to create or make use of any unauthorized connection, whether
physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively or otherwise, with any part of
the cable system without the express consent of the Grantee. Further, without
the express consent of the Grantee, it is a misdemeanor for any person to
tamper with, remove or injure any property, equipment, or part of the cable
system or any means of receiving cable service or other services provided
thereto. Subject to applicable Federal and State law, the City may incorporate
into its criminal code, if not presently a part thereof, criminal misdemeanor law
which will enforce the intent of this section.
113.31 DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED. The following documents are
incorporated herein by this reference, and in the case of a conflict or ambiguity
between or among them, the document of latest date shall govern:
1. Any enabling ordinance in existence as of the date hereof;
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 602 -
2. Any franchise agreement between the Grantee and the City
reflecting the renewal of the franchise, if any.
113.32 PREEMPTION. If the FCC or any other Federal or State body or
agency exercises any paramount jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
franchise, then to the extent such jurisdiction shall preempt and supersede or
preclude the exercise of the like jurisdiction by the City, the jurisdiction of the
City shall cease and no longer exist.
113.33 ACTIONS BY THE CITY. In any action by the City or
representative thereof mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party
shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner. Furthermore, in any
instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such
approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal
lines and tracks or any other types of structures or improvements by
governmental agencies when acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity,

to insure compliance with governing ordinances.
114.11 TIME OF PERFORMANCE. Company shall proceed as soon as
possible from the date of its franchise with due diligence to obtain all necessary
permits and authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business,
including utilities, joint use attachment agreements and microwave carrier

systems. Company shall commence the installation of said system with due
diligence and within a reasonable time subsequent to the obtaining of all the
aforementioned necessary permits and authorizations and shall proceed

twenty-four (24) months, or in the event such system or property has been
installed in any street or public place without complying with requirements of
this chapter, or the rights granted hereunder have been terminated, canceled or
have expired, Company shall promptly remove from the streets and public
places all such property and poles of such system, other than any which the City
may permit to be abandoned in place. In the event of such removal, Company

terminated prior to the date of expiration hereof by the City in the event the

after public hearing, that the Grantee hereof has failed to comply with any
material provision of this chapter or has, by act or omission, materially violated
any term or condition of this chapter. Provided, however, the City shall first

chapter or any rule, order or determination of the City made
pursuant thereto, where such violation shall remain uncured for a
period of thirty (30) days subsequent to receipt by the grantee of a

is caused by any of the following: (a) acts of God; (b) riots; (c)
emergencies declared by competent governmental authority; (d) other

CHAPTER 115 CABLE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
FRANCHISE AUTHORIZATION
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 614 -
City determines that such violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect
was inexcusable as provided in subsection 10 of this section, then the
City may declare, by resolution, the franchise or any renewal thereof be
terminated and of no further force and effect unless there is compliance
within such period as the Council may fix, such period not to be less
than sixty (60) days, provided no opportunity for compliance need be
granted for fraud, misrepresentation or violation of privacy rights. The
issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the
Council agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance.
The Council then may terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding
that the grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend
the period, in its discretion.
12. Removal of System. Upon termination or forfeiture of the
franchise, the grantee shall remove its cable, wires and appliances from
the streets, alleys and other public places within the franchise area. The
Grantee shall also, at its sole cost and expense, restore the streets, alleys
and other public ways to as good condition as existing prior to such
removal, and without affecting the electric, telephone or other cable
communications system facilities.
13. Purchase of System by City. If a renewal of the franchise is
denied, or if the grantee does not seek renewal, the City shall be entitled
to purchase the grantee’s cable communications system in the City for a
price equal to its fair market value, determined on the basis of the system
valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise
itself. The “fair market value” shall be determined by an independent
appraiser mutually agreed upon by the City and the grantee, if the City
and the grantee cannot agree upon the price. If the franchise is revoked

entitled to purchase the grantee’s cable communications system in the
City at an equitable price, established by resolution of the Council
following a public hearing on such issue.

construction of its cable communications system; and provide persons
along the route of the energized cable with individual drops, within time
periods specified in the franchise.
16. Subscriber Service. The grantee shall provide at least a toll-free
or collect telephone number for the reception of subscriber complaints
and shall maintain a repair service capable of responding to subscriber
complaints or requests for service within 24 hours after receipt of the
complaint or request. Whenever it is necessary to shut off or interrupt
services for the purpose of making repairs, adjustments or installations,
the grantee shall do so during a period of minimum use by subscribers.
Unless such interruption is unforeseen, the grantee shall give reasonable
notice thereof to the subscribers affected. Costs incurred in making
repairs, adjustments and installations shall be borne by the grantee,
unless provided otherwise in the franchise.
17. Subscriber Privacy. No signals of a class IV cable
communications channel may be transmitted from a subscriber terminal
for purposes of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices
without the express written permission of the subscriber. The request for
such permission shall be contained in a separate document with a
prominent statement that the subscriber is granting permission with full
knowledge of the document’s provisions. Such written permission shall
be for a limited period of time not to exceed one year, which period may
be renewed at the option of the subscriber. No penalty shall be invoked
for a subscriber’s failure to provide or renew such authorization. The
authorization shall be revocable at any time by the subscriber without
penalty of any kind whatsoever. Such permission shall be required for
each type of classification of class IV cable communications activity
planned for the purpose. No information or data obtained by monitoring
transmission of a signal from a subscriber terminal including, without
limitation, lists of the names and addresses of such subscribers or any
lists that identify the viewing habits of subscribers, shall be sold or
otherwise made available to any party other than to the grantee and its
employees for internal business use, or to the subscriber who is the
subject of that information, unless the grantee has received specific
written authorization from the subscriber to make such data available.
Written permission from the subscriber shall not be required in the event

the grantee conducts a system-wide or individually addressed electronic
sweeps for the purpose of verifying system integrity or monitoring for
the purpose of billing.
18. Programs and Services. The grantee shall construct and operate a
state-of-the-art cable communications system providing the features
specified in the franchise.
19. Rates and Charges. Rates and charges by the grantee shall be

services and residential subscriber installations shall be
nondiscriminatory. The City may regulate all cable system rates when
not prohibited by applicable law.
20. Audit; Review. The City shall have access to and may conduct
(at the City’s option) an annual audit of the grantee’s accounting and
financial records, and grantee’s records of subscriber complaints, in
order to monitor the grantee’s adherence to the terms of the franchise,
this chapter and all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances.
115.11 ACCEPTANCE OF FRANCHISE. No franchise shall be finally
effective until an acceptance in writing has been filed by the grantee with the
Council and payment of all costs and fees required under this chapter or the
franchise have been made.

cable communications system in the City, or any part thereof, without

granted or at any time thereafter, the City reserves the right to regulate any
service when regulation is not specifically prohibited or preempted by Federal
or State law.
115.14 CITY AS GRANTEE. The City, or a subdivision thereof, may be
granted a franchise pursuant to this chapter, in furtherance of the preservation
and improvement of the peace, safety, health, welfare, comfort and convenience
of its residents.
115.15 MULTIPLE FRANCHISES. The City shall not grant an additional
franchise for a cable communications system for an area included in an existing
franchise on terms and conditions more favorable or less burdensome than
those in the existing franchise pertaining to: (a) the area served; (b) public,
educational or governmental access requirements; or (c) franchise fees.

of the City of Cherokee or own property within the City Limits of Cherokee.
One of the five board seats is designated for the Director of the Chamber of

Directors, and approved by the City Council annually. The remaining Board
members shall be appointed by the City Council for overlapping three-year
CHAPTER 124 HOTEL AND MOTEL TAX
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 705 -
terms; however, the initial appointments shall be two (2) members for a twoyear
term; and two (2) members for a three-year term. A number of members
equal to a majority of the number of members appointed to the Board shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. The Board will choose
its Chairperson from its members, and create and fill such other offices as it
may determine. The term of the Chairperson shall be one (1) year, and he or
she shall be eligible for re-election.
124.07 COMPENSATION. The members of the Board shall serve without
compensation.
124.08 RESPONSIBILITIES. The Board shall hold at least one regular
meeting each quarter, and it shall adopt rules for the transaction of business and
shall keep a record of its actions and recommendations, which shall be a public
record.

Hotel/Motel Tax Advisory Board to:
1. Assist the City Council in studying, investigating, developing, and
planning for the use of the hotel/motel tax as outlined in City Code
124.04 and Chapter 423A.2 of the Code of Iowa, subsection 4.
2. Per the City and State Code cited earlier in this section, the City
Council may choose to allocate part or all of the tax through the annual
appropriations process for a specific use. The input of the Board may be
considered, although the City Council has the final authority.
3. Per the City and State Code cited earlier in this section, regarding
the portion of the tax proceeds that the City Council chooses not to
appropriate for a specific purpose but rather to generally appropriate for
recommendations for expenditure throughout the year, the Board may set
its own procedure to accept applications, hold hearings, and provide
recommendations to the City Council on the use of the finds. The City
Council has the final authority. The default percentage of the amount
available for recommendation by the Committee is 50% and may be
adjusted by the City Council during the annual appropriation process or
as deemed necessary.

fee beyond the rate typically set annually by resolution, this Committee
would provide recommendations to the City Council regarding these
funds. These funds would be separately tracked but accumulated and
budgeted in the same manner as the Hotel/Motel tax. However, the
default percentage of the amount of this available for recommendation
CHAPTER 124 HOTEL AND MOTEL TAX
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 706 -
by the Committee is 100% and may be adjusted by the City Council
during the annual appropriations process or as deemed necessary.

bonding or otherwise committing future revenues of this tax as allowed
by State Code.

156.13 SITE CLEARANCE. This covers the demolition of buildings,
garages, existing rubbish, trash or junk and all other items on a property. The
contractor shall completely demolish the structure or structures and remove all
material and debris from site.
1. Backfill. When site conditions permit, as determined by the City
Inspector, on-site soil shall be used as backfill material. The top nine (9)
inches to one (1) foot of topsoil shall be stripped, stockpiled on site for
use as final topsoil and grading material. Topsoil material shall not be
permitted as deep fill material unless directed by the City Inspector. All
fill material shall be approved by the City Inspector before and during
the placing of the material. All depressions on the property shall be
filled, compacted, and leveled to uniform surface.
2. Compacting. Fill material for basements or other large excavated
areas shall be placed in successive one to two foot layers, or as directed
by the City Inspector. Each layer shall be spread and roughly leveled
before the next layer is placed. In addition, each layer shall receive
compaction of or equivalent to two passes of the treads of a bulldozer or
“caterpillar” type end-loader in contact with every part of the surface of
the layer.
3. Grading. The site shall be graded so as to conform to all
surrounding areas and shall be finished so as to have an even surface
which will not permit ponding of water.
4. Additional Fill Material. All additional fill material shall be of
equal quality to the soil adjacent to excavation. The contractor shall
provide for minimum depth of six (6) inches of topsoil over the
excavation area. Backfill, compaction sites shall be leveled and
appropriate ground cover shall be planted to insure and prevent soil
erosion and to stabilize the site. Ground cover compatible with future
property use shall be applied or installed.
156.14 RIGHT-OF-WAY AND PRIVATE PROPERTY. At the end of
each work day the contractor shall see to it that sidewalks, streets, and private
property are cleared of any debris caused by the demolition operation.
CHAPTER 156 DEMOLITION CODE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA

156.15 SAFETY. The method of demolition employed shall comply with the
Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 as applicable.
156.16 SEWER AND WATER DISCONNECTIONS.
1. All sewer lines shall be plugged by an approved plumber and
inspected by the City Inspector prior to demolition or excavations. It
shall be the contractor’s responsibility to ascertain that all sewer lines
serving any existing buildings or structures within the demolition
boundaries are plugged as specified.
2. Main Branch Sewer. The main branch sewer serving the area
shall be cut off at the lot line. The portion of the branch sewer which
remains connected to the City system shall be cut off at the lot line and
shall be tightly and permanently sealed with a plug of mortar not less
than eight (8) inches thick. Partial removal of sufficient portions of the
basement floor, other parts of the structure where necessary, and
necessary excavation inside are required if necessary to satisfy this
section.
3. Alternative Cut Off Location. If the close proximity of the
building to the lot line or other reasons make severance of the branch
sewer at the lot line impracticable, in the opinion of the City Inspector,
the contractor shall make the required sewer disconnection as near as
possible to the lot line or at some other one point approved by the City
Inspector. In any case, the disconnection shall be made in a location
which will completely cut off all building sewers and drains from City
system. Cutting or plugging of several buildings, sewer or drain lines in
lieu of cutting the main branch sewer is not acceptable.
4. Protection of Sewer Lines. The sealed end of the branch sewer
shall be left in sound condition and fully protected by backfill to prevent
damage during subsequent demolition operations.
5. Water Lines. All water lines and stubs for the buildings or
properties within the demolition boundaries must be disconnected.
156.17 INSPECTOR. The demolition inspector shall inspect all water and
sewer cut-offs for the purpose of making the final inspection.
156.18 BACKFILL AND COMPACTION. Backfill and compaction shall
be completed in accordance with Standard City of Cherokee Policies for Street
Backfill.

contract. All utilities shall be repaired or replaced in accordance with the City
of Cherokee’s Standard Specifications at the contractor’s expense.
156.20 INSPECTIONS.
1. Site Inspection. The contractor shall make a site inspection with
the City Inspector before issuance of a Notice to Proceed.
2. Sewer and Water Disconnections. Sewer and water
disconnections shall be inspected and certified by the City Inspector
before payment may be made and before the demolition permits are
issued for the structures involved.
3. Basement Inspection. A basement excavation inspection shall be
made by the City Inspector after the structures are removed and before
any filling is done. It is the contractor’s responsibility to see that the
City Inspector is notified in time to make these inspections. Failure to
do so may result in re-excavation of the basement area at the contractor’s
expense.
4. Final Inspection. Final inspection shall be made by the City
Inspector upon completion of filling, grading, cleanup and restoration.
Other inspections may be made if called for by the contractor or at the
City’s option.
5. Building Inspection. The City Building Inspector shall certify

facilities, or any other operations or facilities of the City. The City shall have
the right and power by resolution of its City Council to specifically direct the
location of right-of-way user facilities with reference to City facilities, existing
or proposed, in such a manner as shall serve the public use and convenience.
Failure or refusal by a right-of-way user to promptly follow such directions

that such relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any City public
improvement or for the operations of the City in or upon the City right-of-way.
157.07 REMOVAL OF UNAUTHORIZED FACILITIES. Within thirty
(30) days following written notice from the City, a right-of-way user that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized facility within the City right-of-way
shall remove such facilities from the City right-of-way at the right-of-way users
sole expense. A facility is unauthorized if:
1. Any license, permit or authorization required by Federal, State or
City regulations with respect to the facilities has not been obtained, has
been revoked, or allowed to expire.
2. The facilities are not installed in accordance with the permit for
installation or other requirements of this chapter.

installation permit shall be a violation by the right- of-way user, regardless of
involvement of agents or contractors of the right-of-way user.
CHAPTER 157 USE OF CITY RIGHT-OF-WAY
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA

157.09 EMERGENCY REMOVAL OR RELOCATION. The City shall
have the right and power to cut or move any right-of-way facilities in the City
right-of-way as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in
response to any public health or safety emergency. The City shall endeavor to
give notice of such emergency disruption but nothing in this chapter shall be
deemed to create a duty to give such notice. Restoration of right-of-way
facilities that have been cut or moved as aforesaid shall be done by the right-ofway
user at its own expense.
157.10 COORDINATION OF INSTALLATIONS. All right-of-way users
with facilities in the City right-of-way or who expect to install facilities in the
City right- of-way shall coordinate such activities with the City.

2. The City may require performance security in an amount
commensurate with the scope of the work, to secure satisfactory
installation in accordance with the installation permit, by means of an
irrevocable letter of credit in a form approved by the City Attorney or by
cash deposit.
157.12 APPEAL TO CITY COUNCIL. A right-of-way user that is denied
registration, denied a right-of-way installation permit, that has its right-of-way
installation permit revoked, or that believes that the fees imposed do not
conform to the requirements of Chapter 480A, Code of Iowa, may request in
writing that such denial, revocation or fee imposition be reviewed by the City
Council. The City Council shall act within sixty (60) days of a timely written
request. A decision by the City Council affirming the denial, revocation, or fee
imposition must be in writing and supported by a written finding establishing
the reasonableness of the decision.
157.13 NO EASEMENT, PERMISSION ONLY, NOT ASSIGNABLE.
The provisions of this chapter, and the permits and authorizations granted
pursuant to this chapter, shall not be deemed to create or grant to anyone any
easement, estate, or interest in the property of the City. A permit to install
right-of-way user facilities in the City right of-way is a mere license, that is, an
authorization to the stated entity to go onto the land of the City to do only that
which is explicitly stated by the permit, that may be revoked by the City as
provided in this chapter, and that cannot be assigned to another. A right-ofCHAPTER

way user that occupies City right-of-way or makes an installation of facilities in
the City right-of-way on the basis of a purported assignment of an installation
permit granted to another entity, shall be in violation of this section.
157.14 FRANCHISE FEE CREDIT. For a right-of-way user that pays a
franchise fee, the amount of any registration fee paid in securing a right-of-way
permit shall be applied as a credit to reduce the amount due for the franchise
fee.

Code of the City of Cherokee, this section shall be hereafter known as the
City Rental Housing Code and may be cited as such and will be referred to as
such in this section.
102.11.2 Scope. The provisions of this section shall be deemed to apply to all
dwellings or portions thereof used or designed or intended to be used for
human habitation. All occupancies in existing buildings may be continued as
provided in previously adopted Building Code(s) except such structures as
are found to be substandard as defined in this code. Where any building or
portion thereof is used or intended to be used as a combination apartment
house-hotel, the provisions of this code shall apply to the separate portions as
if they were separate buildings. Every rooming house or lodging house shall
comply with all of the requirements of this code applicable to dwellings.
102.11.3 Dwellings--Definition. A dwelling is any house or building or

dwelling units in the City, to insure their compliance with this code. The
inspectors appointed under the provisions of this section shall be charged
with the responsibility of performing inspections of rental dwelling units in
the City only, but shall not be charged with the duty of enforcing the
provisions of this chapter. The City Administrator (hereinafter referred to as
Building Official) shall be responsible for the enforcement of this chapter
and may also make any inspections required under the provisions of this
chapter.
CHAPTER 159 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND
HOUSING CODE
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 825 -
102.11.5 Regular inspections. Regular inspections of rental dwelling units
shall be required every three years.
102.11.6 Registration of Rental Units. Every person, firm or corporation that
offers for rent a dwelling or portion(s) thereof within the City shall register
that rental unit with the City by filling out a form approved by the Building
Official. Such application shall be accompanied by an "inspection and
application fee" in an amount established by Council resolution. Upon
receipt of such application, the City shall cause an inspection of the premises
and, if the same comply with the provisions of this chapter, issue an
inspection certificate. If the premises fail to comply, the housing inspector
shall notify the applicant in writing, stating the reasons for such
noncompliance.
102.11.7 Additional inspections. In addition to the inspections required under
Section 102.11.5, the city inspector or inspectors are also empowered to
make similar inspections of all rental units as frequently as may be necessary
and may make inspection at any reasonable time on a written complaint
submitted by the owner or tenant.
102.11.8 Inspection fees for additional inspections. When an inspection is
made at the request of the owner, an inspection fee as provided in Section
102.11.6 shall be charged. If an inspection is made at the written request of a
tenant and the dwelling is found to be in noncompliance, due to an omission
of the owner, such owner shall be responsible for the re-inspection fee. No
inspection shall be conducted at the request of a tenant unless the tenant has
first submitted his complaint, in writing, to the landlord. If, after a written
complaint by the tenant, the dwelling is found to comply, or if such
noncompliance is due to conduct on the part of the tenant, the tenant shall be
liable for the cost of such inspection. If such costs are not paid by the tenant
within thirty days from date of billing, the City may initiate an action in law
or in equity to recover the same, in which event the tenant shall be liable for
reasonable attorney fees. No fee shall be charged to the owner for such
inspection. In the event an inspection is initiated by the City or at the request
of a person other than the owner or tenant, and if the building is found to be
in noncompliance, the owner shall be liable for such inspection fees. In the
event that on the date of the inspection the building complies with the
provisions of the housing code, no fee shall be charged. In the event that on
the date of inspection a dwelling fails to comply with the provisions of the
housing code, which necessitates additional inspections, the owner shall be
liable for the cost of such re-inspections. All fees required under this chapter
shall be paid prior to the issuance or renewal of the inspection certificate.
102.11.9 Entrance and survey of buildings. The Building Official and/or his
designees may, without fee, except as provided herein, enter, examine, make
necessary records and survey all rental dwellings within the City. If entry
into the interior portion of a dwelling unit is required, twenty-four hours'
notice to the owner and the tenant shall be given by the City. The owner or
his agent or representative and the lessee and occupant of every rental
dwelling and every person having the care and management of the same
shall, at all reasonable times when required by such officers or persons, give
them free access to such rental dwellings and premises. The owner of a rental

dwellings at reasonable times for the purpose of bringing about compliance
with the provisions of this chapter or any order issued thereunder.
102.11.10 Inspection certificate required. From and after the first day of
October 2014, no person shall rent, lease, let, operate, or otherwise allow the
occupancy of any dwelling unless such person holds a valid inspection
certificate as is required by this chapter.
102.11.11 Inspection Certificate - Provisional. Initial certificates issued by
the City shall be stamped "Provisional 1", "Provisional 2" or "Provisional 3".

the City of Cherokee, but that the owner has registered the dwelling unit.
Those designated as Provisional 1 shall be inspected by the Building Official
within 12 months after said Inspection Certificate has been issued. Those
designated as Provisional 2 shall be inspected by the Building Official within
24 months after said Inspection Certificate has been issued. Those designated

shall expire in three years after the original date of its issuance. The housing
inspector shall inspect each such dwelling within sixty days prior to the
expiration date of the certificate so that the Building Official may determine

C. Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon
request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this
section that will not be contrary to the public interest, where
owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions
of this section will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances
granted must meet the following applicable standards.
(1) Variances shall only be granted upon (i) a showing
of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the
granting of the variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local
codes or ordinances.
(2) Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the 100-
year flood would result. Consideration of the effects of
any development on flood levels shall be based upon the
assumption that an equal degree of development would be
allowed for similarly situated lands.
(3) Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(4) In cases where the variance involves a lower level
of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily
required by this section, the applicant shall be notified in
writing over the signature of the Administrator that (i) the
issuance of a variance will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for
$100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction
increases risks to life and property.
(5) All variances granted shall have the concurrence or
approval of the Department of Natural Resources.
D. Hearings and Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.
(1) Hearings. Upon the filing with the Board of
Adjustment of an appeal, an application for a conditional
use or a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a
public hearing. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for
the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 921 -
notice to parties in interest. At the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or attorney and present
written or oral evidence. The Board may require the
appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the
technical assistance and/or evaluation of a professional
engineer or other expert person or agency, including the
Department of Natural Resources.
(2) Decisions. The Board shall arrive at a decision on
an appeal, conditional use or variance within a reasonable
time. In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so long as
such action is in conformity with the provisions of this
section, reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed
from, and it shall make its decision, in writing, setting forth
the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision. In
granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall
consider such factors as contained in this section and all
other relevant sections of this section and may prescribe
such conditions as contained in subsection 19 of this
section.
18. Factors Upon Which the Decision To Grant Variances Is Based.
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all
relevant factors specified in other sections of this section and:
A. The danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments.
B. The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or
downstream to the injury of others.
C. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions.
D. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents

G. The availability of alternate locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
H. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable
future.
I. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and flood plain management program for the area.
J. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
K. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.

after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public
utilities (sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities,
streets and bridges.
M. Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this
section.
19. Conditions Attached To Variances. Upon consideration of the
factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose

this section.
E. Floodproofing measures designed consistent with the flood
protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities,
durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and
other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The Board of
Adjustment shall require that the applicant submit a plan or

other official charged with enforcing this

unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move or convert any
sign in the City, or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a
sign permit for each such sign from the Administrator as required by this
Code. These directives shall not be construed to require any permit for a
change of copy on any sign, nor for the repainting, cleaning and other
normal maintenance or repair of a sign or sign structure for which a
permit has previously been issued, as long as the sign or sign structure is
not modified in any way. No new permit is required for signs which
have pen-nits and which conform with the requirements of this Code on
the date of its adoption unless and until the sign is altered or relocated.
A change in ownership of any premises or business for which a sign
permit has previously been issued may require a new permit to be issued
by the Administrator. A sign permit issued by the Administrator shall
become null and void if manufacture and/or installation is not
commenced within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of
such permit. If work authorized by such permit is suspended or

commenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee
will be one-half the amount required for the original permit for such
work, provided that no changes have been made in the original plans.
Such permit may not be unreasonably withheld, providing that proper
application and payment of permit fees is complied with.
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 957 -
A. Application for Permit. Application for a permit in
accordance with Figure 1, on file at City Hall, shall be made to
the Administrator upon a form provided at City Hall and shall be
accompanied by such information as may be required to assure
compliance with all appropriate laws and regulations of the City
including:
(1) Name and address of the owner of the sign and/or
owner's agent.
(2) Name and address of the owner or the person in
possession of the premises where the sign is located or to
be located.
(3) Clear and legible drawings with description
definitely showing location of the sign which is the subject
of the permit and all other existing signs whose
construction requires permits, when such signs are on the
same premises.
(4) Drawings showing the dimensions, construction
supports, sizes, electrical wiring and components, materials
of the sign and method of attachment and character of
structural members to which attachment is to be made.
The design, quality, materials and loading shall conform to
the requirements of the current Uniform Building Code. If
required by the Administrator, engineering data shall be
supplied on plans submitted certified by a duly licensed
engineer.
(5) Owner and contractor shall agree to hold harmless
and indemnify the City, its officers, agents and employees
from any and all claims of negligence resulting from the
erection, alteration, relocation, maintenance of a sign or
other sign work insofar as this Code has not specifically
directed the placement of a sign.
B. Issuance of Denial of Permit. The Administrator shall
issue a permit for the erection, alterations, or relocation of a sign
within the City when an application therefor has been properly
made and the sign complies with all appropriate laws and
regulations of the City. The Administrator may, in writing,
suspend or revoke a permit issued under provisions of this Section
whenever the permit is issued on the basis of a miss-statement of
fact or fraud. When a sign permit is denied by the Administrator,
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 958 -
he shall give written notice of the denial to the applicant, together
with a brief statement of the reasons for the denial.
C. Permit Fees. Application for permits shall be filed with the
Administrator, together with a permit fee as specified per City fee
schedule set by the City Council. If more than one sign is being
erected at the same time, they may be listed on the same permit
application and there will be only one fee charged, that for the
sign erected that carries the highest fee. Such fee schedule will be
reviewed yearly. In addition, when any sign is hereafter erected,
placed, installed or otherwise established on any property prior to
obtaining permits as required by this section, the fees specified
hereunder shall be doubled, but the payment of such double fee
shall not relieve any person from complying with other provisions
of this section or from penalties prescribed herein.
(Ord. 478 – Aug-04 Supp.)
D. Special Use Permit. It is recognized that circumstances
may exist from time to time where strict application of the size,
location and type of sign standards hereinafter specified for the
various zoning districts may be unreasonable or where literal
enforcement of these regulations may work a hardship on the
applicant. Variations from the standards are, therefore, permitted
by issuance of a Special Use Permit by the Board of Adjustment
when such extenuating circumstances exist, provided that in
issuing such permit the Board of Adjustment shall not authorize a
substantial variance from the size, location and type standards
applicable to signs in similar situations. A variance from these
standards is to be considered only where authorized, and the
procedure for application shall be the same as provided for in
Cherokee City Code Section 165.20.
E. Notice of Change. Whenever there is a change in the sign
user, owner, or owner of the property on which the sign is located,
the new sign user, owner or new property owner shall forthwith
notify the Administrator of the change.
F. Inspection. The person erecting, altering or relocating a
sign shall notify the Administrator upon completion of the work
for which permits are required.

to a footing inspection, prior to erection, and all signs
having electrical components shall be subject to a final
electrical inspection by the Administrator or his/her
delegate.

not limited to those signs for which permits or for which
no permits or permit fees are required, shall be maintained
in good structural condition at all times. All signs,
including those exempted, shall be kept neatly painted,
including all metal parts and supports. An inspection can
be applied by either of two methods: (1) The Administrator
or his/her delegate can request that a licensed sign
company duly certify and file with the City that the sign
meets as nearly as possible all of the structural, electrical
and material specifications set out in this Code or the laws
or regulations of the City; or (2) Alternatively, the City
shall send out an inspector and the inspector shall verify
that the sign is in a safe condition with respect to its
physical characteristics.
(3) Signs Declared Unlawful. The Administrator or
his/her delegate may declare any sign unlawful if it
endangers public safety by reasons of inadequate
maintenance, dilapidation or abandonment. Any such
declaration shall state the reasons of the Administrator or
his/her delegate for stating that the sign constitutes a safety
hazard to the general public.
Any sign owned, kept, displayed or maintained by any person within
the City which is unlawful pursuant to the provisions of this code is
hereby declared to be in violation of this Code. The Administrator
or his/her delegate may declare any such sign to be unlawful, and
such declaration shall state in writing the reason or reasons why
such sign and the keeping, owning, maintenance, construction and
display or operation thereof is unlawful under the terms of this
Code, and such declaration shall be sent to the owner and shall
include notification that unless such violation is corrected within
thirty (30) days, said sign shall be removed at the owner's expense.
6. Licensing. Any sign company seeking to erect, construct,
enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, maintain, or convert any sign shall
demonstrate and register with the City a statement that they have all of
the necessary licenses from all other governmental agencies applicable,
or shall be represented by a duly licensed agent or sub-contractor.
7. Nonconforming Signs.
A. Legally Nonconforming Signs. Such signs may be
continued and maintained subject to the provisions of Subsection
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
CODE OF ORDINANCES, CHEROKEE, IOWA
- 960 -
B, provided that a nonconforming sign shall not be enlarged,
reconstructed, structurally altered or changed in any manner, nor
shall copy on an on-premises nonconforming sign be changed to
advertise or identify any use other than that in operation on the
effective date of this ordinance. No sign that has been erected in
violation of any previously existing regulation shall be granted
legal nonconforming status.
B. Termination of Legally Nonconforming Signs. A legally
nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal status, and
shall immediately comply with the provisions of this ordinance or
be removed, if any of the following occurs:
(1) Abandonment. Any sign which advertises or
identifies a business, product, or service that has not been
available or in operation at the location for more than
ninety (90) days, or which has not been maintained in a
state of good repair for such time, shall be deemed to be
abandoned and nonconforming status terminated and the
sign and structure shall be removed. This provision shall
not apply to permanent signs belonging to businesses that
are open only on a seasonal basis, provided there is a clear
intent to continue operation of the business.
(2) Destruction, Damage, or Obsolescence. If more
than 60% of the face of a sign is damaged or destroyed, or
if a sign is structurally damaged, the sign shall be brought
in conformance with this ordinance.
(3) Amortization. Legally nonconforming signs shall
be maintained only as long as they advertise or identify the
business or nature thereof in existence on the effective date
of this ordinance. Change of copy, enlargement,
relocation, reconstruction, structural alteration or other
change shall not be permitted. The right to maintain a
legally nonconforming sign shall be granted to the business
in existence on the effective date of this ordinance and
shall not be transferable to another business, use or lot, but
shall expire along with discontinuation of the business,
service, or product being advertised on the effective date of
this ordinance. Copy on off-premises signs and changeable
copy boards which is meant to be periodically changed
may be changed without affecting the legally
nonconforming status.

Board of Adjustment from the Administrator's denial of a sign

conditions of this chapter, or any failure to comply with any of its

five hundred (500) feet and shall terminate with a turnaround, having an
outside roadway diameter of at least eighty (80) feet and a street property
line diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet. The right-of-way width
of the straight portion of such streets shall be a minimum of sixty (60)
feet. The property line at the intersection of the turnaround and the
straight portion of the street shall be rounded at a radius of not less than

rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary
for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
B. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad
right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the
Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on
each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in
residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined
with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and
future grade separations.
CHAPTER 166 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS

health concern of the City that demands reasonable regulation of adultoriented
establishments in order to protect the health and well-being of
the community;

thereby protect the health and welfare of its residents; protect residents
from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property
values and character of the surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the
spread of blight;
