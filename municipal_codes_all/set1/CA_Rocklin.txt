ROCKLIN, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Rocklin, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 15, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The Rocklin, California, Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1981, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Russell A. Hildebrand, city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 15, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1117, passed August 13, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title , then chapter , and ending with section . Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 15 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 15, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 15 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 15, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 15, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use.

If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

4.  A statement that if the nuisance is not voluntarily abated within the stated period, and the property owner and/or person in possession of the property fails to present the information set forth in subsection (B)(3) of this section or to file a timely written request for a hearing, all persons served with such notice shall be deemed to have consented to the abatement of the nuisance and that, at the election of the city, the city will abate the nuisance and the costs for such abatement may be charged against the premises and may be recorded as a lien against the premises.

If the owner of record, after diligent search, cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days. The failure to make or attempt such service on any person as required herein shall not invalidate any proceedings under this chapter as to any other person duly served. 
D.  Failure to Pay CostsAuthority to Record Lien or to Declare Lien a Special Assessment Against Parcel. 
1.  If all or any portion of the costs and expenses incurred by the city in abating the nuisance and accounted for by the enforcement authority remain unpaid after thirty days, pursuant to authority created by law, including Government Code section 38773 et seq., such portion thereof as remains unpaid shall constitute and shall be declared to constitute a lien on the real property which was the subject of notice to abate.

4.  In addition to the recordation of a lien, the amount of the costs and expenses incurred by the city in abating the nuisance plus a reasonable administrative fee established by the city council from time to time to cover the cost of collection may be declared a special assessment against any real property owned by the responsible person within the city to the extent the responsible person owns more than one parcel within the city. The city council may impose the special assessment on more than one parcel. However, the amount of the assessment shall not exceed the penalty imposed for the administrative violation. The city manager or his/her designee may present a resolution to the city council to declare a special assessment, and upon passage and adoption thereof, shall cause a certified copy thereof to be recorded with the Placer County recorder's office. The assessment may then be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subjected to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. 
5.  In the event that the lien or special assessment is discharged, released, or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the information specified in subsection (D)(1) of this section shall be recorded.

Chapter 2.46 - MOBILE HOME RENT ORDINANCE 
Sections:  
Article I. - Purpose and Findings 
 
2.46.010 - Findings and declarations. 
The city council of the city finds and declares as follows: 
A.  A significant majority of the residents of mobile home parks in the city are older individuals or couples living on fixed incomes. 
B.  These residents qualify as "low" and "lower" income households and typically expend more than thirty percent of their income on housing-related expenses. 
C.  Nearly two-thirds of the residents own their mobile homes outright, having made a substantial monetary investment to live in a mobile home park. 
D.  Nearly all mobile home park residents own and occupy their mobile home. 
E.  Residents of a mobile home park have very limited mobility due to the difficulty and expense of relocating a mobile home. 
F.  Due to their limited incomes, the large investment in their mobile homes, and the immobility of mobile homes, mobile home park residents generally have very limited economic bargaining power concerning rents charged for mobile home lots. 
G.  There is a limited amount of alternative housing affordable to and suitable for the typical mobile home park resident. 
H.  During the two years prior to enactment of mobile home rent control in the city, mobile home lot rents increased substantially. During the time mobile home rent control has been in effect, petitions for additional substantial rent increases have been submitted, indicating continued upward pressure on rents. 
I.  The city is committed to providing for the development of the city's fair share of decent, safe and sanitary housing affordable to all economic segments of the community. 
J.  Mobile home parks are a valuable resource of affordable housing for low and moderate income individuals and families. 
K.  Based on the city's 1988 rental survey, the overall city apartment vacancy rate is 2.24 percent. The vacancy rate in subsidized and lower-end nonsubsidized complexes is zero percent with a waiting list of up to 2.5 years. These results indicate a shortage of affordable housing for low and moderate income individuals and families. 
L.  To remedy the continued upward pressure on rents and shortage of affordable housing, the council desires to encourage the development of a variety of types of housing units affordable to all economic segments of the community, especially mobile home lots affordable to low and moderate income individuals and families. 
M.  While rent control protects mobile home park residents from excessive and exploitive rent increases, it also discourages the development of new mobile home parks and the expansion of existing parks, thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable housing. In addition, rent control may encourage mobile home park owners to convert existing parks to other uses and discourage adequate maintenance and services in existing parks. 
N.  Permanent mobile home rent control has proven to be a costly administrative burden and an inefficient city response to the affordable housing shortage. 
O.  Continued protection for the current residents of mobile home parks from excessive and exploitive rent increase is necessary for and consistent with the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. 594 § 2 (part), 1988).  
2.46.020 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to protect current residents of mobile home parks from excessive, unreasonable or exploitive rent increases by continuing rent control protection until a voluntary vacancy occurs; to give adequate notice to future residents of the economic risks of locating in a mobile home park and the absence of rent control; to promote the development of new mobile home parks and the expansion of existing mobile home parks as a source of housing affordable to low and moderate income individuals and families; to permit mobile home park owners to receive a fair and reasonable return; to establish an efficient and speedy process to review rent increases; and to provide for an alternative dispute resolution process. 
B.  To achieve the above purpose and to further the interests of justice, the provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed. 
C.  No provision of this chapter shall be construed or applied to prohibit the grant of a rent increase that is demonstrated to be necessary to provide a landlord with a fair and reasonable return as provided by law. 
(Ord. 594 § 2 (part), 1988).  
Article II. - Definitions 
 
2.46.030 - Affected rental unit.

2.46.050 - Capital improvements. 
"Capital improvements" means the addition or replacement of any improvement to a unit or property within the geographic boundaries of a mobile home park, or outside such boundaries but which are directly and primarily for the benefit of the park, and which meets the following conditions: 
A.  The addition or replacement has a useful life of at least five years; and 
B.  Either: 
1.  The addition or replacement is necessary in order to maintain compliance with applicable local code requirements affecting health and safety, or 
2.  The addition or replacement is provided by the mobile home park owner primarily to benefit the residents of the affected rental units;

E.  A petition for a rent increase under this section may be filed in conjunction with a petition filed under Section 2.46.450. 
(Ord. 594 § 2 (part), 1988).  
2.46.470 - Petition for rent increaseOffsets. 
A.  If the administrative hearing officer finds that service reductions have occurred, the administrative hearing officer shall determine the value of the service reductions and shall offset the rent increase allowed under Sections 2.46.450 and/or 2.46.460 by the value of the service reductions. Service reductions which affect all rental units subject to the proposed rent increase shall be prorated over all such rental units, regardless of the number of residents claiming such service reductions. 
B.  In determining the value of any service reductions, the administrative hearing officer shall consider the following factors: 
1.  The area affected by the service reduction; 
2.  The length of time the resident has been subjected to the service reduction; 
3.  The degree of discomfort the service reduction imposes on the resident; 
4.  The extent to which the service reduction causes the rental unit or rental units to be uninhabitable; 
5.  The extent to which the service reduction causes a material reduction in the usability of the rental unit; 
6.  Other similar factors deemed relevant by the administrative hearing officer. 
(Ord. 594 § 2 (part), 1988).  
2.46.480 - Petition for rent increaseAdditional adjustment. 
Where the administrative hearing officer allows a rent increase under Sections 2.46.450 and/or 2.46.460, an additional three percent of the base rent before the allowed increase shall also be allowed. 
(Ord. 594 § 2 (part), 1988).  
2.46.490 - Petition for rent increaseFair market rentDecision. 
A.  Where a landlord finds that the rent increase allowed under Section 2.46.400, and any increase that would be allowable under Section 2.46.450 for operation and maintenance and Section 2.46.460 for rehabilitation and capital improvement costs, plus the adjustment allowed under Section 2.46.480, would be inadequate to provide the landlord with a fair and reasonable return, or where the landlord disputes the base rent presumption in Section 2.46.360, the landlord may file a petition for a rent increase under this section in lieu of the increase allowed under Section 2.46.400 and in lieu of a petition under Sections 2.46.450 and/or 2.46.460. 
B.  The notice of hearing given under Section 2.46.520 on a petition filed under this section shall direct the landlord and the affected homeowners and tenants to submit to the administrative hearing officer at the hearing one or more names of qualified appraisers they wish to nominate to determine fair market rents for the mobile home park. 
C.  1.  Upon submission of the names at the hearing, the administrative hearing officer shall divide the names into two lists, one list being those nominated by the landlord and the other list being those nominated by the homeowners and tenants. 
2.  The administrative hearing officer shall then review the lists and shall select as the appraiser anyone who appears on both lists. 
3.  If no name appears on both lists, the administrative hearing officer shall select a name from each list. 
4.  If one list contains no names, the administrative hearing officer shall select a name at random from the names submitted. 
5.  If no names are submitted, the petition shall be dismissed. 
6.  At the hearing and prior to selection of the appraiser or appraisers by the administrative hearing officer, any party may move to disqualify a nominee on the grounds he or she is not a qualified appraiser. The administrative hearing officer shall hear the motion at that time or continue the hearing on the motion and the petition for no more than ten days. At the conclusion of the hearing on the motion, the administrative hearing officer shall rule on the motion, and the ruling shall be final. The hearing on the petition shall then resume. 
D.  Once the appraiser or appraisers are selected, the administrative hearing officer shall direct the landlord to retain the appraiser or appraisers. If one appraiser has been selected, one appraisal and appraisal report shall be prepared. If two appraisers are selected under subsection C3 of this section, each shall independently make an appraisal and prepare an appraisal report. Notwithstanding Section 2.46.550, the hearing shall be continued until the appraisal(s) is completed. The appraiser(s) shall be directed to determine fair market rents for the mobile home park in issue, taking into consideration the following: 
1.  Whether or not and the extent to which rents in the mobile home park are depressed due to the past effects of rent control, historically low rents, and any other factors which have artificially depressed rents in the mobile home park or the mobile home rental market in the region; 
2.  Whether or not and the extent to which rents in the mobile home park are elevated due to the scarcity of mobile home lots in the region in relation to demand, the difficulty in relocating mobile home units, and any other factors which have artificially elevated rents in the mobile home park or the mobile home rental market in the region; 
3.  The existence or nonexistence of unreimbursed capital improvements or rehabilitation work; the extent and quality of park amenities and services; location and setting; aesthetic value; operation and maintenance costs; and quality of management and maintenance. 
E.  The appraisal report(s) shall include, as an appendix, all background and backup data considered by the appraiser(s) in reaching the conclusion. 
F.  When the appraisal report(s) is completed, the landlord shall file two copies of the appraisal report(s) with the administrative hearing officer. The administrative hearing officer shall then notify the homeowners and tenants that the appraisal report(s) is available for inspection and copying and shall schedule the hearing to resume no sooner than ten working days from the date of the notice. 
G.  At the hearing, the administrative hearing officer shall receive the appraisal report(s) into evidence and otherwise conduct the hearing in accordance with Article VIII of this chapter; provided, that the subject matter of the hearing shall be limited to the appraisal(s) and the determination of fair market rents. 
H.  The administrative hearing officer shall set rents at the level(s) he finds to be fair market rents and that will provide the landlord a fair and reasonable return. 
I.  The rent allowed under subsection H of this section shall become the base rent and shall be conclusively presumed to provide the landlord with a fair and reasonable return. 
J.  Once a petition for rent increase is filed under this section and a decision is made, another petition under this section for the same lots in the same park may not be filed for four years, provided a petition under this section may be filed more frequently upon a showing of hardship. 
(Ord. 594 § 2 (part), 1988).

Due to the unique nature of legal services, the city manager is authorized to execute contracts for professional legal services up to one hundred thousand dollars. Professional legal service contracts in excess of one hundred thousand dollars require council approval. 
Notwithstanding the above limits, the city manager, or his/her designee, is authorized to execute a contract for professional services without city council approval if a developer has deposited funds sufficient to cover the full amount of the contract with the city (as verified by the chief financial officer or his/her designee), and such funds are held in a deposit account that restricts the use of the funds to pay for city-managed professional services contracts, such as the preparation of an environmental impact report.

F.  Public Works Projects. The city of Rocklin is considered a general law city and is subject to the procedures set forth in Article 4 of the Local Agency Public Construction Act (California Public Contract Code commencing with Section 20160). In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this chapter, and the Public Contract Code, the Public Contract Code shall take precedence. 
1.  Projects Under the Section 20162 LimitNo Bids Required. Projects under the limit specified in California Public Contract Code section 20162, and as amended from time to time (five thousand dollars or less at the time of adoption of these policies) may be performed by the employees of the city by force account, by negotiated contract, or by purchase order. The department head, or his/her designee, is authorized to execute project contracts under the Section 20162 limit, if adequate funds have been appropriated by the city council in the budget.

Public works projects above the limit set forth in the California Public Contract Code section 20162 (five thousand dollars at the time of adoption of these policies) shall be contracted by formal bidding procedures as set forth in the Public Contract Code. Contracts must be approved by the city council, and subsequent to such approval, may be executed by the city manager. City council appropriation of funds is required prior to or concurrently with the approval of the contract. 
3.  Contingency Amount for Public Works Projects. 
a.  Except as otherwise provided herein, a contingency amount of fifteen percent is hereby automatically authorized for all public works project contracts awarded by either the city council or the city manager or his/her designee, without further action, as long as adequate funds have been appropriated. The contingency amount shall be administered by the department head responsible for the public works project. The city council or city manager, as applicable, may set a different contingency amount on a project-specific basis. The contingency amount shall be used to fund only contract change orders for the applicable public works project. 
b.  When determining the authorization limit for a public works project contract, the contingency amount shall be included. For example, a public works project with an initial contract amount of thirty thousand dollars and a contingency of fifteen percent would result in a total contract amount of thirty-four thousand five hundred dollars. 
4.  Change Orders. All change orders for public works projects shall comply with the city of Rocklin standard construction specifications and shall be approved in writing by the department head responsible for the public works project prior to the work being performed. If a contract change order would cause the total amount of contract change orders to exceed the contingency amount authorized by the city council or city manager, the department head shall obtain the consent of the city council or city manager prior to approving the work. 
5.  Utility Relocation. The city council hereby authorizes and delegates authority to the department head responsible for the public works project to negotiate and execute contracts for the relocation of utilities necessitated by a public works project with utility companies. Such authority shall only be exercised (a) in accordance with state law, city ordinances and adopted city policies, as applicable (b) only if adequate funds for the contract have been included in the approved city budget for the applicable year, or otherwise appropriated by the city council, and (c) subject to city attorney approval as to form and legality.

The tabulation of all bids received shall be open to public inspection after the bid opening. 
C.  Bid Evaluation and Acceptance. Bids received at or prior to the time set for bid opening shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this policy. Bids shall be evaluated to determine the lowest responsible bidder. The process includes a determination of: (1) which bidder is the lowest monetary bidder; (2) whether the lowest monetary bidder submitted a responsive bid; and (3) whether or not the lowest monetary bidder is responsible. To be responsive, the bid must conform to the material terms of the bid package. The requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs.

City may waive any informality, irregularity, immaterial defects or technicalities in any response. 
D.  Correction or Withdrawal of Bids. Subject to any provisions of federal or state granting authorities to the contrary, correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, shall be in accordance with this section.

If a bidder who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found non-responsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the city manager or his/her designee. The unreasonable failure of a bidder to supply promptly information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of non-responsibility with respect to such bidder. A copy of the determination shall be sent promptly to the non-responsible bidder. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file.

c.  Contracts will be awarded to a responsible contractor (2 C.F.R. 200.318(h). 
d.  Cost or price analysis will be performed to determine that the cost or price of the contract is fair and reasonable (2 CFR 200.323): 
(i)  Before receiving bids or proposals, city staff will perform a cost or price analysis to make independent estimates. The method and degree of analysis will be dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation. 
(ii)  The city will negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition, and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration must be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work. 
(iii)  Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts are allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be otherwise allowable. 
e.  The use of cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting must not be used (2 CFR 200.323(c)(d)). 
f.  Time and materials contracts (2 CFR 200.318(j)). 
(i)  Time and materials contracts are allowed only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. City will assert a high degree of oversight in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls. The contract will include language specifying the ceiling price and limiting duration of the contract. 
g.  Piggybacking is allowed for the period of the emergency circumstance. 
h.  For all work that is not of a short duration, the existing competitive procurement procedures apply. 
B.  Sole or Limited Source (No Competitive Advantage by Soliciting Bids). A contract may be awarded without competition when the city determines in writing, after conducting a good faith review of available sources, that there is only one source for the required goods, service, or construction item. In the case of contracts of fifty thousand dollars or less, this determination shall be made by the city manager and, in the case of contracts in the amount of more than fifty thousand dollars, this determination shall be made by the city council. The city manager or his/her designee shall conduct negotiations, as appropriate, as to price, delivery, and terms. A statement of the basis for the sole source determination shall be provided to the city clerk along with the fully-executed contract. 
C.  Cooperative Purchasing/Procurement. The city is authorized to enter into cooperative purchasing/procurement arrangements with other governmental entities (i.e., joint power authorities) without separate competitive bidding by the city if a governmental agency has solicited bids and awarded a contract for the goods or services which the city desires to obtain, and participation in such an arrangement is agreeable to the bidder awarded the contract. 
1.  For the purchase of goods in an amount of twenty-five thousand dollars or less, the department head is authorized to make this determination. For the purchase of goods in an amount up to fifty thousand dollars, the city manager is authorized to make this determination. For purchases in an amount more than fifty thousand dollars, this determination shall be made by the city council. Utilizing cooperative purchasing arrangements does not eliminate the requirement to enter into a contract directly between the city and the vendor providing the goods. 
2.  For the procurement of services in an amount of twenty-five thousand dollars or less, the department head is authorized to make this determination. For the procurement of services in an amount up to fifty thousand dollars, the city manager is authorized to make this determination. For the procurement of services in an amount more than fifty thousand dollars, this determination shall be made by the city council. 
3.  A contract directly between the city and the vendor is required for the purchase of goods or the procurement of services rendered through a cooperative purchasing arrangement, unless otherwise approved by the city attorney. 
D.  Piggyback Purchasing. Piggyback contracting occurs when one entity assigns the contractual rights it has in a contract to another. The city is authorized, without prior competitive bidding, to contract for the purchase of goods or procurement of services with vendors who have been awarded contracts by government agencies (i.e., California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS) contracts), for the purchase of goods or services under the competitive processes applicable to the government agency, within the past twelve months. In the case of contracts of fifty thousand dollars or less, this determination shall be made by the city manager and, in the case of contracts in the amount of more than fifty thousand dollars, this determination shall be made by the city council. A contract directly between the city and the vendor is required for the purchase of goods or the procurement of services rendered through a piggyback purchasing arrangement, unless otherwise approved by the city attorney. 
E.  Public Interest. In limited and unique circumstances, competitive bidding and/or the RFP process is not required when it would be impossible, or not in the public interest. This exception may apply when the purchase is for: (1) a specialized technology product or service, (2) an addition to, or repair or maintenance of, existing equipment which can be more efficiently added to, repaired or maintained by a particular company or manufacturer, or (3) equipment which must be compatible with existing equipment, by reason of the training of the personnel or an inventory of existing replacement parts kept by the city. For contracts of fifty thousand dollars or less, this determination shall be made by the city manager and, for contracts in the amount of more than fifty thousand dollars, this determination shall be made by the city council. A statement of the basis for the determination shall be provided to the city clerk along with the fully-executed contract. 
(Ord. No. 1113, § 3, 4-23-2019)  
3.04.100 - General requirements. 
The following general policies shall apply, if applicable, to: (1) the purchase of goods (2) the procurement of services, (3) the procurement of professional services, or (4) public works projects. 
A.  Purchase Orders. Except for purchases made with a city CalCard or using an accounts payable expense form, a purchase order must be completed for the purchase of goods or procurement of services and professional services, and for public works projects, in order to encumber the expenditure against the budget. 
B.  Contracts. For the purchase of goods, or the procurement of services or professional services, in excess of five thousand dollars, a contract is required in a form approved by the city attorney, unless an exception is made by the city attorney. Copies of all contracts required by this policy must be provided to the city clerk for recordkeeping purposes. Change orders or amendments to a contract which result in the total contract amount exceeding the authority of the department head shall require city manager approval. Change orders or amendments to a contract which result in the total contract amount exceeding the authority of the city manager shall require city council approval. The maximum term for any contract shall be three years, unless a longer initial term or renewal term is approved by the city council. Contracts may be renewed thereafter following completion of a competitive bid or request for proposal process as set forth in Sections 3.04.070 and 3.04.080 above. 
C.  Insurance. A vendor of services or professional services is required to provide insurance certificates and endorsements. Generally, the types of insurance, amount of coverage, and policy endorsements shall be consistent with the recommendations of NCCSIF third party insurance administrators. For contracts in an amount up to twenty-five thousand dollars, the department head may waive or reduce the insurance requirements, after consulting with the city attorney, and shall document in the file the basis for any waiver or reduction. For contracts in an amount greater than twenty-five thousand dollars up to fifty thousand dollars, the city manager may waive or reduce the insurance requirements, after consulting with the city attorney, and shall document in the file the basis for any waiver or reduction. The city council may waive or reduce the insurance requirements for contracts in an amount over fifty thousand dollars. 
D.  Structuring and Splitting. The structuring or splitting of the purchase of goods, procurement of services or professional services, and for public works projects, without proper justification or to avoid the authorization limits, is prohibited. Additionally, if it is reasonably anticipated by the department head that the annual total cost of a particular good or service would require a competitive sealed bid process, then incremental purchases of that good or service shall be pursuant to a competitive sealed bid process. For example, if a department normally purchases one hundred sixty tires annually from a single vendor, which would require a sealed bid process, then incremental purchases of forty tires shall be pursuant to a sealed bid process. This example is applicable to the procurement of services that are expected to reach a total annual amount that requires a competitive bid process or a higher level of authorization. 
E.  Delegation of Contracting Authority. 
1.  The city council retains all contracting authority not specifically delegated in these policies. This procurement policy shall supersede all resolutions and policies adopted prior to adoption of these policies that delegated contracting authority to the city manager or other subordinate city officials or employees, and specifically supersedes Resolution No. 2015-280. 
2.  Any delegation of contracting authority contained in these policies shall only be exercised (a) in accordance with state law, city ordinances and adopted city policies, as applicable, and (b) only if adequate funds have been included in the approved city budget for the applicable year or otherwise appropriated by the city council. 
F.  City Attorney Contract Review. The city attorney shall approve all contracts in excess of five thousand dollars, including amendments to contracts, as to form and legality prior to the execution of the contract by the authorized city official. The city attorney's approval shall be evidenced by his or her signature on the contract. City attorney approval on change orders to public works projects is not required, but may be requested, at the discretion of the city manager or department head responsible for the public works project. 
G.  Local Preference. 
1.  Purchasing goods and services from local vendors is desired because it stimulates the local economy and recognizes that our local vendors are valued members of our community. If factors such as quality, previous performance, and availability are equal among vendors, a vendor whose business is located within the city of Rocklin limits shall be awarded a contract if their quote or bid is within three percent of the low bid for purchases of goods or services up to fifty thousand dollars, or within one percent of the low bid for purchases of goods or services greater than fifty thousand dollars up to one hundred fifty thousand dollars. 
2.  Local preference does not apply to public works projects, purchases procured under federal or state requirements, or cooperative or piggy-back purchases through other governmental agencies. 
3.  The vendor must have a valid city of Rocklin business license and employ at least one full time employee located at the Rocklin address. 
4.  Vendor selection for professional services usually is based primarily on qualifications and project schedule. Nonetheless, the local preference may be taken into account in reaching a final consultant selection decision. 
5.  Local vendors must bid or issue quotes with same or comparable specification as required of non-local vendors. 
6.  The following language shall be included in each invitation for bids or solicitation for quotes where the local preference shall apply: 
  
"Local Vendor Preference: By City Council action, a three percent (3.0%) preference shall be granted to local bidders for goods or services for contracts up to $50,000, and a one percent (1.0%) preference shall be granted to local bidders for goods and services for contracts greater than $50,000 up to $150,000. A local bidder is defined as a business entity with a fixed place of business located within the city limits of the City of ROCKLIN, and employs at least one full time employee located at the ROCKLIN address. To qualify for the preference, local bidders must submit proof of the address of this fixed place of business, proof of one full-time employee, and a copy of their current city business license. This information must be submitted with each bid for which a local preference is claimed. 
  
"Local Preference Claimed: ___YES ___NO" 
H.  Multi-Year Contracts. Unless otherwise approved by the city council, a contract for goods or services may be entered into for any period of time deemed to be in the best interest of the city, up to a maximum of three years, provided that the term of the contract and renewal provisions are included in the original solicitation process. Contracts may not contain auto-renewal provisions, unless approved by the city attorney. Funds must be appropriated prior to contract execution for the first fiscal year's obligation. The contract must allow the city to cancel the agreement without penalty if the city council does not appropriate funds after the first year of the contract. Prior to contract renewal beyond a three-year term, departments must conduct new bid, solicitation for quotes, or RFP process for the goods, services or professional services, excluding legal services. The city manager may authorize an exception to this re-bid requirement for good cause, which shall be documented and maintained by the department as set forth in Section 7 [of Ordinance No. 1113]. 
I.  Encumbrance of Funds. Except in cases of emergency, or by order of the city council, purchase orders shall not be issued and purchases shall not be made unless there exists an unencumbered appropriation within the department's budget (for capital purchases, on the account code level; for operational expenditures, on the departmental fund operational basis). 
J.  Unlawful Purchases or Contracts. If any officer or employee purchases or contracts for any goods or services contrary to the provisions of these policies, such purchase order or contract shall be void and of no effect. 
K.  Recordkeeping. Each department is responsible for maintaining its own purchasing and contracting records, including RFP and bidding documentation, pursuant to the city's current record retention policy. All original procurement contracts, along with a digital copy of RFP and bidding documentation, must be provided to the city clerk for safekeeping/recordkeeping purposes. Copies of contracts are acceptable when the original is not available or when contracts are digitally signed. 
(Ord. No. 1113, § 3, 4-23-2019)  
3.04.110 - Disposition of surplus supplies, materials and equipment. 
A.  All city departments shall submit to the purchasing officer, at such times and in such form as the purchasing officer shall prescribe, reports showing all supplies, materials and equipment which are no longer needed or which have become obsolete or worn out. The purchasing officer shall have authority to sell all supplies, materials and equipment which cannot be used or which have become unsuitable for city use, or to exchange the same for, or trade in the same on, new supplies, materials and equipment. For items valued in excess of five thousand dollars, such sales shall be made by solicitation of informal bids/written offers for purchase. If there are no bids, the property may be sold at private sale, donated to charity, or disposed of in the manner most economically beneficial to the city. 
B.  The amount received for any property sold pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in the general fund or other fund so designated by the purchasing officer. 
C.  Except as provided by state code, the purchasing officer shall determine the disposition of unclaimed or abandoned property in the possession of the police department. 
(Ord. No. 1113, § 3, 4-23-2019)

Sections: 
 
3.08.010 - Assessment and collection by county. 
The council elects that the duties of assessing property and collecting taxes, heretofore performed by the assessor and tax collector of the city, shall be performed by the county assessor and the county tax collector. 
(Ord. 130A § 1, 1955).  
3.08.020 - Authority. 
This election is made pursuant to Article 5, Part 2, Chapter 1 of the Government Code (Government Code § 51500, et seq.). 
(Ord. 435 § 2, 1980: Ord. 130A § 2, 1955).  
Chapter 3.12 - AUTOMATIC ANNUAL TAX ADJUSTMENT 
Section: 
 
3.12.010 - Cost-of-living adjustment required. 
Notwithstanding any provision of any ordinance, resolution or policy to the contrary, all fees and taxes, excluding ad valorem real property taxes and any sales or transaction tax applicable to real property, for whatever purpose, currently imposed and collected by and/or for the city shall, commencing on July 1, 1978 and each July 1st thereafter, be adjusted by the amount of the cost of living, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, U.S. Government, for the San Francisco-Bay Area, for the year ending the preceding March 31st. 
(Ord. 374 § 1, 1978).  
3.12.020 - Computation. 
Any fee or tax adjusted under the provisions of Section 3.12.010 shall be computed as follows: For any flat fee or tax, the amount for the previous year shall be multiplied by the percentage adjustment in the cost of living and rounded to the nearest dollar. 
(Ord. 374 § 2, 1978).  
3.12.030 - Fee and tax list. 
The city manager shall keep a current list, available to any person upon demand, of the current fees and taxes, and the latest adjustment, if any, based on the cost of living.

Chapter 3.16 - CONSTRUCTION TAXES AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES 
Sections:  
Article I. - Capital Expenditures and Park and Recreation Tax 
 
3.16.010 - Purpose. 
The council finds and declares that the fees required to be paid by this article are assessed pursuant to the taxing power of the city solely for the purpose of producing revenue, and not for regulatory purposes. The purpose of such fees is to continue to provide adequate public facilities commensurate with the increasing demand thereupon for the city, occasioned by the substantial amount of new construction within the city, which demand cannot be met by other available funding sources. Industrial structures and multiple-family buildings with more than four dwelling units require additional and more sophisticated firefighting equipment than do other structures. 
(Ord. 329 § 6, 1977).  
3.16.020 - Effect on prior ordinances. 
The fees required to be paid under this article shall in no way affect any similar fees collected pursuant to Ordinance Nos. 253 or 304 and 324 as the same read prior to the enactment of the ordinance codified in this article. 
(Ord. 329 § 7, 1977).  
3.16.030 - Value-based tax imposed. 
A.  There is imposed a tax on the privilege of constructing: 
1.  Any new building; 
2.  The conversion of any existing building from a nonresidential to residential use; 
3.  An addition to any building. 
B.  The tax, payable concurrently with the issuance of a building permit, shall be based on the valuation determined for issuance of such permit, as follows: 
1.  For any building designed to be occupied for industrial purposes, and for any multiple-family building in excess of one story in height and/or having more than four dwelling units, one percent of the valuation; 
2.  For all other buildings and structures, three-fourths of one percent. 
(Ord. 373 § 1, 1978: Ord. 329 § 2, 1977).  
3.16.040 - Tax in lieu of park fee imposed. 
Where a building intended for multiple-family occupancy which contains three or more dwelling units is constructed on a parcel of land for which no park fees have been paid pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act, a sum per dwelling unit, in amount established by resolution of the city council, shall be imposed as a tax on the privilege of constructing the building, in addition to the tax payable pursuant to Section 3.16.030. Revenue derived pursuant to this section shall be used for park and recreational purposes only. 
(Ord. 435 § 8 (part), 1981; Ord. 373 § 2, 1978: Ord. 329 § 3, 1977).  
3.16.050 - Exceptions. 
The tax imposed in Section 3.16.030 shall not apply to the privilege of constructing the following: 
A.  Garages, sheds, carports, gazebos, pools, spas, patios, decks, patio or deck covers, and similar structures or outdoor appurtenances accessory to any existing residential building; 
B.  Alterations, repairs, and remodeling of existing residential buildings, including increases in interior floor area of up to six hundred square feet or twenty percent of the existing living area of the building, whichever is greater. This exception shall not apply to the creation or addition of a separate living unit to an existing residential building; 
C.  Alterations, repairs, or remodeling of any existing nonresidential building or structure that does not increase the total interior floor area of the building or structure. This exception does not apply to initial interior improvements of partially constructed shell buildings; 
D.  Reconstruction or repair of any building or structure which was damaged by earthquake, fire, flood or other natural cause over which the owner had no control; provided, that the dwelling is rebuilt or repaired to approximately the same configuration and same square footage as before the damage occurred, and the building permit for the work is applied for within one year of the occurrence of the damages. Compliance with any applicable ordinance or law is not a cause over which the owner had no control; 
E.  Additions, repairs or replacements of plumbing, mechanical, electrical, air pollution control, fire extinguishing, processing or similar equipment to existing buildings; 
F.  Additions of minor accessory structures which do not significantly impact the need for the capital expenditures described in Section 3.16.060. 
(Ord. 551 § 1, 1986: Ord. 329 § 4, 1977).  
3.16.060 - Use of funds. 
Except as provided in Section 3.16.040, all sums collected pursuant to this article shall be for capital expenditures of the following types: 
A.  Purchase of land or interests therein; 
B.  Development of parks and related recreational uses; 
C.  Acquisition of open space; 
D.  Development of public buildings;

(Ord. 329 § 5, 1977).  
Article II. - Traffic Circulation Surcharge 
 
3.16.070 - PurposeNot tax on the district. 
A.  The council finds that the construction of structures contributes to the problems of traffic circulation and creates a need for new traffic improvements. The council finds that this article is necessary to make new developments consistent with the general plan and the traffic circulation element thereof. The council intends, by the ordinance codified in this article, to raise revenue to alleviate the health, safety and welfare problems resulting from traffic congestion by imposing a surcharge on construction in relation to such problems. 
B.  The council finds that this article is not a special tax imposed "on the district" as prescribed by Section 4 of Article XIII, A of the California Constitution. 
(Ord. 398 § 1 (part), 1979).  
3.16.080 - ImposedPayment. 
A.  A surcharge of one percent of the valuation of any structure for which a building permit is required is imposed upon the application for such permit, except as provided in this article. 
B.  The surcharge of one percent shall be multiplied by the valuation of the structure for which application is made. Such surcharge shall be due at the time of application for the permit and shall be payable at the time of, and as a condition of, the issuance of such permit. 
(Ord. 398 § 1 (part), 1979).  
3.16.090 - Exceptions. 
The surcharge imposed in Section 3.16.080 shall not apply to building permits for the following: 
A.  Garages, sheds, carports, gazebos, pools, spas, patios, decks, patio or deck covers, and similar structures or outdoor appurtenances accessory to any existing residential building; 
B.

This exception shall not apply to the creation or addition of a separate living unit to an existing residential building; 
C.  Alterations, repairs, or remodeling of any existing nonresidential building or structure that does not increase the total interior floor area of the building or structure. This exception does not apply to initial interior improvements of partially constructed shell buildings; 
D.  Reconstruction or repair of any building or structure which was damaged by earthquake, fire, flood or other natural cause over which the owner had no control; provided, that the dwelling is rebuilt or repaired to approximately the same configuration and same square footage as before the damage occurred, and the building permit for the work is applied for within one year of the occurrence of the damages. Compliance with any applicable ordinance or law is not a cause over which the owner had no control; 
E.  Additions, repairs or replacements of plumbing, mechanical, electrical, air pollution control, fire extinguishing, processing or similar equipment to existing buildings; 
F.  Addition of minor accessory structures which do not significantly impact the city's need for traffic circulation improvements as described in Section 3.16.100. 
(Ord. 551 § 2, 1986: Ord. 460 § 1, 1981; Ord. 398 § 1 (part), 1979).  
3.16.100 - Revenues. 
Revenues derived from the imposition of this surcharge shall be used pursuant to the traffic circulation element of the general plan of the city. 
(Ord. 398 § 2, 1979).  
Article III. - Fee for Traffic Signalization and Control 
 
3.16.110 - Findings. 
A.  There is occurring in the city a substantial amount of new residential, commercial and industrial development. 
B.  This development is creating additional vehicular traffic in the city. 
C.  Increased traffic flows on the city streets requires the installation of new traffic control devices, including electric traffic signals. 
D.  The cost of such traffic controls is high, and other revenue sources of the city are insufficient to pay such costs. 
E.  The cost of the necessary traffic control devices should be borne by those who are generating the increased demand for those devices. 
(Ord. 343 § 1, 1977).  
3.16.120 - Fund established. 
There is established a fund to be known as the "Traffic Control and Signalization Fund" ("the fund"). All moneys collected pursuant to this article shall be separately maintained in the fund and disbursements therefrom shall be only for the purposes set forth in this article. 
(Ord. 343 § 2, 1977).  
3.16.130 - Fee imposedCollectionRestriction.

2.  Alterations, repairs, and remodeling of existing residential buildings, including increases in interior floor area of up to six hundred square feet or twenty percent of the existing living area of the building, whichever is greater. This exception shall not apply to the creation or addition of a separate living unit to an existing residential building; 
3.  Alterations, repairs, or remodeling of any existing nonresidential building or structure that does not increase the total interior floor area of the building or structure. This exception does not apply to initial interior improvements of partially constructed shell buildings; 
4.  Reconstruction or repair of any building or structure which was damaged by earthquake, fire, flood or other natural cause over which the owner had no control; provided, that the dwelling is rebuilt or repaired to approximately the same configuration and same square footage as before the damage occurred, and the building permit for the work is applied for within one year of the occurrence of the damages. Compliance with any applicable ordinance or law is not a cause over which the owner had no control; 
5.  Additions, repairs or replacements of plumbing, mechanical, electrical, air pollution control, fire extinguishing, processing or similar equipment to existing buildings; 
6.  Additions of minor accessory structures which do not significantly impact the city's need for traffic signalization and control devices. 
(Ord. 551 §§ 3, 4, 1986; Ord. 459 § 1, 1981; Ord. 343 § 3, 1977).  
3.16.140 - Disbursements from fund. 
Disbursements shall be made from the fund upon recommendation of the city engineer and approval of the council for the following purposes: 
A.  Electric traffic signal lights; 
B.  Traffic control signs; 
C.  Warning signals, signs and markings; 
D.  Other traffic control devices as are determined necessary to ensure the safe and orderly flow of traffic. 
(Ord. 343 § 4, 1977).  
Article IV. - Traffic Impact Fee 
 
3.16.200 - Purpose. 
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the transportation element of the city of Rocklin General Plan, and to mitigate the traffic impacts caused by new development in the city, certain street improvements must be or had to be constructed. The city council has determined that a development impact fee is needed in order to finance these public improvements and to pay for development's fair share of the construction costs of these improvements. In establishing the fee described in the following sections, the city council has found the fee to be consistent with its General Plan and, pursuant to Government Code Section 65913.2, has considered the effects of the fee with respect to the city's housing needs as established in the housing element of the General Plan. 
(Ord. 601 § 1 (part), 1989).  
3.16.210 - Traffic impact fee. 
A traffic impact fee is hereby established on issuance of all building permits for development in the city to pay for street improvements. The city council shall, in a council resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fee, describe the specific types of development and the benefit and impact area on which the impact fee is imposed, list the specific street improvements to be financed, describe the estimated cost of these improvements, describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types of development, and set forth time for payment. As described in the fee resolution, this impact fee shall be paid prior to issuance of building permits. On an annual basis, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of development and whether the described street improvements are still needed. 
(Ord. 601 § 1 (part), 1989).  
3.16.220 - Limited use of fees. 
The revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate and special account and such revenues, along with any interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to: 
A.  Pay for the cost, including administrative costs, of future construction of street improvements described in the resolution enacted pursuant to Section 3.16.210 of this chapter, or to reimburse the city for those described or listed street improvements constructed in whole or in part by the city with funds advanced by the city from other sources; or 
B.  Reimburse developers who have been required or permitted by Section 3.16.230 of this chapter to install such street improvements which are oversized with supplemental size, length or capacity. 
(Ord. 601 § 1 (part), 1989).  
3.16.230 - Developer construction of facilities. 
Whenever a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a development permit, to construct a street improvement described in a resolution adopted pursuant to Section 3.16.210 of this chapter, which improvements are determined by the city to have supplemental size, length or capacity over that needed for the impacts of that development, and when such construction is necessary to ensure efficient and timely construction of the street improvement network, a reimbursement agreement with the developer and/or a credit against all or a portion of the fee which would otherwise be charged pursuant to this chapter on the development project may be offered. The reimbursement amount shall not include the portion of the improvements needed to provide services to, or mitigate the need for street improvements created by the development, nor shall the developer be relieved from the obligation to pay that portion of the fee needed to mitigate impacts created by the development on the street system elsewhere in the city. 
(Ord. 601 § 1 (part), 1989).  
3.16.240 - Exemption from payment of traffic circulation surcharge and traffic signalization fee.

A.  A developer of any project subject to the fee described in Section 3.16.210 or Section 3.16.410 may apply to the city council for a reduction or adjustment to that fee, or a waiver of that fee, based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or nexus between the development impacts of that project and either the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk at the time of filing an application for a building permit or, if a discretionary planning or zoning entitlement is required, no later than ten days prior to the hearing on the entitlement. The application shall state in detail the factual basis for the claim of waiver, reduction or adjustment.

Article VI. - Park and Recreation Facilities Improvement Fee 
 
3.16.400 - Purpose. 
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the open space, conservation and recreation element of the city of Rocklin General Plan, and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city, certain park and recreation facilities improvements must be or had to be constructed. The city council has determined that a development impact fee is needed in order to finance these public improvements and to pay for development's fair share of the construction costs of these improvements. In establishing the fee described in the following sections, the city council has found the fee to be consistent with its General Plan and has considered the effects of the fee with respect to the city's housing needs as established in the housing element of the General Plan. 
(Ord. 799 § 3 (part), 1999).  
3.16.410 - Park and recreation facilities improvement fee. 
An improvement fee is established on issuance of all building permits for development in the city to pay for park and recreational facilities improvements. The city council shall, in a council resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fee, describe the specific types of development and the benefit and impact area on which the impact fee is imposed, list the specific park and recreational facilities improvements to be financed, describe the estimated cost of these improvements, describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types or development, provide for a credit for any fees previously paid, and set forth time for payment. As described in the fee resolution, this impact fee shall be paid prior to issuance of building permits. On an annual basis, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of development and whether the described park and recreational facilities improvements are still needed. 
(Ord. 799 § 3 (part), 1999).  
3.16.420 - Limited use of fees. 
The revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate and special account and such revenues, along with any interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to: 
A.  Pay for the cost, including administrative costs, of future construction of park and recreational facilities improvements described in the resolution enacted pursuant to Section 3.16.410, or to reimburse the city for those described or listed park and recreational facilities improvements constructed in whole or in part by the city with funds advanced by the city from other sources; or 
B.  Reimburse developers who have been required or permitted by Section 3.16.430 to install such park and recreational facilities improvements which are oversized with supplemental size or capacity. 
(Ord. 799 § 3 (part), 1999).  
3.16.430 - Developer construction of facilities. 
Whenever a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a development permit, to construct a park and recreational facilities improvement described in a resolution adopted pursuant to Section 3.16.410, which improvements are determined by the city to have supplemental size or capacity over that needed for the impacts of that development, and when such construction is necessary to ensure efficient and timely construction of park and recreational facilities, a reimbursement agreement with the developer and/or a credit against all or a portion of the fee which would otherwise be charged pursuant to this article on the development project may be offered. The reimbursement amount shall not include the portion of the improvements needed to provide services to, or mitigate the need for park and recreational facilities improvements created by the development, nor shall the developer be relieved from the obligation to pay that portion of the fee needed to mitigate impacts created by the development on parks and recreational facilities elsewhere in the city. 
(Ord. 799 § 3 (part), 1999).  
Article VII. - Public Facilities Impact Fee 
 
3.16.500 - Purpose. 
The city council finds and declares that the purpose of this article is as follows: 
A.  The city must be provided, in a time frame related to its development, with an adequate level of public facilities so as to maintain adequate levels of public services. 
B.  New development and the expansion of existing development within the city impose a burden on the existing public facilities and create a need for additional public facilities. Such burdens may vary by the type of land use. 
C.  Analysis of the current land use within the city makes it possible to estimate the burden or need for various public facilities generated by different types of land uses. Analysis of the land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the type and amount of public facilities necessary to support that additional land use. It is therefore possible to construct a fee, imposed on new development, which equitably spreads the burden of public facilities to development which creates the need for them. It is the intent of this article to create such a fee, spreading costs of public facilities to development which creates the need for such public facilities, without generating any surplus to the general fund. It is the further purpose of this article to implement the general plan by assuring that adequate public facilities are financed and provided to serve the city. 
D.  The fee established by this article has been calculated in the manner set forth in the report, as hereinafter defined, so as to pay for those facilities listed in the report. 
E.  The fee established by this article is in addition to any other fees or charges required by law as a condition of development. 
F.  The fee established by this article is to be collected for public facilities for which an account has been established and funds appropriated, and for which a proposed construction schedule has been adopted. 
G.  The failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this article relating to payment of the fee on building permits would jeopardize residents of the community, in that it would permit construction to proceed without adequate public facilities or means of financing said public facilities. 
H.  The city council has considered the effect of the fee imposed by this article with respect to the housing needs of the city as a whole and of the region, particularly as required by the housing element of the general plan, and the city council finds that this article does not unduly adversely affect the city's ability to provide for such needs. 
I.  The establishment of the fee is for the purpose of obtaining funds for capital projects, necessary to maintain service required by the general plan within existing service areas and existing portions of the city which are developed or for which land use has already been granted. 
(Ord. 893 § 1 (part), 2005).

As described in the fee resolution, this impact fee shall be paid prior to issuance of building permits. On an annual basis, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of development and whether the described public facilities are still needed. 
(Ord. 893 § 1 (part), 2005).

(Ord. 893 § 1 (part), 2005).  
3.16.540 - Limited use of fees. 
The revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate and special account and such revenues, along with any interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to:

(Ord. 893 § 1 (part), 2005).  
3.16.550 - Developer construction of facilities. 
Whenever a developer is required as a condition of approval of a development permit to construct a public facility described in a resolution adopted pursuant to Section 3.16.520 of this article, which improvement is determined by the city to have supplemental size or capacity over that needed for the impacts of that development, and when such construction is necessary to ensure efficient and timely construction of public facilities, a reimbursement agreement with the developer and/or a credit against all or a portion of the fee which would otherwise be charged pursuant to the ordinance codified in this article on the development project may be offered. The reimbursement amount shall not include the portion of the improvements needed to provide services to, or mitigate the need for public facilities created by the development, nor shall the developer be relieved from the obligation to pay that portion of the fee needed to mitigate impacts created by the development on public facilities elsewhere in the city.

To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; 
C.  To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes; 
D.  To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

Sections: 
 
3.32.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  By enacting this chapter, the city council establishes a policy of recovering the costs of providing services of a voluntary and limited nature from those utilizing those services, so that general tax revenues are not diverted from general services of a broad nature to be used to subsidize such limited benefit services. 
B.  To implement this policy, this chapter establishes a service fee revenue/cost comparison system to ascertain and provide for the recovery of the cost of providing services through user service fees. 
C.  The service fee revenue/cost comparison system provides a mechanism for ensuring that fees adopted by the city council do not exceed the costs reasonably borne of providing the services for which the fees are charged. 
(Ord. 717 § 1 (part), 1995).  
3.32.020 - Applicability. 
A.  This chapter applies only to fees for those services listed in Section 3.32.050 below.

(Ord. 717 § 1 (part), 1995).  
3.32.030 - Service fee revenue/cost comparison system. 
A.  There is hereby established a service fee revenue/cost comparison system by which the amount of each service fee shall first be calculated at the cost reasonably borne to provide the service, and then set at a designated percentage of that cost, as determined by the city council. "Costs reasonably borne" shall be as defined in Section 3.32.040 below. The percentage of the cost to be recovered by the fee shall be in the sole discretion of the council.

B.  Appeals Fees. The city council may establish a schedule for appeals fees by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1087, § 3, 1-23-2018)  
5.01.030 - Procedure for filing an appeal. 
A.  Appeal to City Manager. If a party is aggrieved of an administrative decision under this Title 5, they may appeal the decision to the city manager by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen calendar days after the date upon which the written administrative decision was deposited in the U.S. mail. The notice of appeal shall contain a statement of the grounds to be relied upon for reversing the decision being appealed. In the event the last calendar day of the filing period falls on a non-business day, the appeal period shall be extended to include the next business day. In the absence of a timely appeal and the payment of any applicable appeal fee, the original administrative decision shall be final. 
The city manager shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal not later than forty-five calendar days after the notice of appeal is received. At least ten calendar days' notice shall be given to the appellant of the time and place of the hearing by serving the notice personally or by depositing it in the United States mail to the address provided by appellant in his/her notice of appeal. The city manager may hear the appeal in person and shall render a written decision within fifteen calendar days of the hearing. The city manager's written decision shall include appellant's right to appeal the decision to the city council. 
B.  Informal Resolution. Persons denied a permit or otherwise aggrieved by a determination of a city official under this title may meet and/or confer with the city official who issued the decision or the appropriate department head in an effort to informally resolve the matter. Such efforts to informally resolve the matter do not extend the time for filing a formal appeal under subsection A above. In the event the matter is informally resolved prior to the hearing date set by the city manager, the city will refund any appeals fees paid provided the appellant has withdrawn their formal appeal. 
C.  Appeal to City Council. The decision of the city manager may be appealed to the city council by filing a notice of appeal containing appellant's grounds for appeal with the city clerk within fifteen calendar days after the date upon which the city manager's decision is made. In the absence of a timely appeal and payment of any applicable appeal fee, the decision of the city manager shall be final. 
The city clerk shall fix a time and place for the city council hearing of such appeal not later than forty-five calendar days after the notice of appeal is received. At least ten calendar days' notice shall be given to the appellant of the time and place of the hearing by serving the notice personally or by depositing it in the United States mail to the address provided by appellant in his/her notice of appeal. 
At such hearing before the city council, the appellant shall show cause on the grounds specified in the notice of appeal why the action appealed from should be reversed. The city council may continue the hearing from time to time; provided, however, that the hearing shall occur and be concluded no later than thirty calendar days after the original date set for hearing. The city council shall render a written decision within fifteen calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing and its decision to affirm, reject or modify the decision of the city manager shall be final and subject to judicial review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.8.

5.04.020 - Revenue measure only. 
This chapter is enacted solely to raise revenue for municipal purposes and is not intended for regulation. The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be in addition to any other tax or fee which may be imposed by any other provision of this code or other ordinance or resolution of the city.

5.04.030 - Effect on other ordinances. 
The payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, and its acceptance by the city, and the issuance of a certificate to any person, shall not entitle that person to carry on the business so licensed unless that person complies with all other applicable laws of the city, or to carry on any business in any building or on any premises designated in the certificate if such building or premises is situated in a zone in which the conduct of such business is not allowed.

When, by reason of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of California, the business tax imposed by this chapter cannot be enforced without there being an apportionment according to the amount of business done in the city, or in the state, as the case may be, the collector may make such rules and regulations for the apportionment of the tax as are necessary or desirable to overcome the constitutional objections.

In cases where a taxpayer believes he or she is placed in the wrong business or class of business or businesses, he or she may apply in writing to the collector for a change in classification setting forth in full the reason for requesting such change. The collector shall conduct an investigation and shall thereupon render a decision in writing as to the proper classification or classifications.

Each department of the city which issues permits or entitlements of use shall require the production of a valid unexpired certificate prior to the issuance of such a permit. The immediately preceding sentence shall not be construed to require any person to obtain a certificate prior to doing business within the city if such requirement conflicts with the constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the state.

Any person so violating any of the provisions of this chapter or knowingly or intentionally misrepresenting to any officer or employee of this city any material fact in procuring the certificate herein provided for shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as provided in Chapter 1.18 of this code. 
C.  The conviction and punishment of any person for engaging in any business without a valid certificate shall not relieve such person from paying taxes and penalties due and unpaid at the time of such conviction, nor shall the payment of any tax or penalty prevent a criminal prosecution for the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. All remedies prescribed in this chapter shall be cumulative and the use of one or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter. 
D.  Any sum required to be paid under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed to the city, and any person who engages in any business without first obtaining and paying for a valid certificate as required by this chapter shall be liable in an action by and in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction for recovery of any such sum. 
(Ord. 546 § 1 (part), 1986).

(Ord. 546 § 1 (part), 1986).  
5.04.100 - Constitutional apportionment. 
A.  None of the business license taxes provided for by this chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the constitution of the United States and the state. 
B.  In any case where a business license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a certificate to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed business license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The collector shall then conduct an investigation and, after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory or, if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the tax to be charged, the collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the collector determine the gross receipts measure of the tax to be the proper basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of the applicant's business in the city or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor; provided, that no additional business license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual business license tax as prescribed in this chapter. 
(Ord. 546 § 1 (part), 1986).  
5.04.110 - Exemptions. 
A.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or the state from the payment of such taxes as are herein prescribed.

5.04.160 - ApplicationSworn statementConclusiveness. 
No statements shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth therein, nor shall the filing of the same preclude the city from collecting by appropriate action such sum as is actually due and payable hereunder. Such statement and each of the several items therein contained shall be subject to audit and verification by the collector or authorized employees of the city who are authorized to examine, audit and inspect such books and records of any licensee or applicant for a certificate as may be necessary in their judgment to verify or ascertain the amount of business license tax due, and who may demand that the licensee or applicant file a corrected statement.

C.  Grantee shall notify grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property.

An application shall be submitted to grantor not less than one hundred twenty days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the qualifications and financial and technical capability to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise.

E.  Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable television system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations.

Assess against grantee liquidated damages in an amount set forth in the franchise agreement for any such violation(s) if such violation is not cured, or if grantee has not commenced a cure, on a schedule acceptable to grantor, within thirty days after written notice to the grantee of grantor's intention to assess liquidated damages. Such assessment may be withdrawn from the security fund, and shall not constitute a waiver by grantor of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise or applicable law, including without limitation, its right to recover from grantee such additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including actual attorney's fees, as may have been suffered or incurred by grantor by reason of or arising out of such breach of the franchise.

D.  If grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon grantor; 
E.  If grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged a bankruptcy. 
The termination and forfeiture of the grantee's franchise shall in no way affect any right of grantor to pursue any other remedy under the franchise or any provision of law. 
(Ord. 744 § 2 (part), 1996).  
5.16.380 - Procedure for remedying franchise violations. 
Prior to imposing any remedy or other sanction against grantee specified in Section 5.16.360, 5.16.370, or otherwise, grantor shall give grantee notice and opportunity to be heard on the matter, in accordance with the following procedures: 
A.  Grantor shall first notify grantee of the violation in writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand correction within a reasonable time, which shall be not less than sixty days. If grantee fails to correct the violation within the time prescribed, or fails to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantor shall then give written notice of not less than twenty days of a public hearing to be held before the city council. Said notice shall specify the violations alleged to have occurred. 
B.  At the public hearing, the council shall hear and consider all other relevant evidence, and thereafter render findings and its decision. 
C.  If the council finds that the grantee has corrected the violation, or has diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, or that no material violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed. In determining whether a violation is material, the council shall take into consideration the reliability of the evidence of the violation; the nature of the violation; the damage (if any) caused to the grantor and/or the public; whether the violation was chronic; and any justifying or mitigating circumstances and such other matters as the council deems appropriate.

B.  Within ten days of written notification of a finding of violation by grantor, grantee may notify grantor in writing of its intention to invoke mediation procedures. Within fifteen days of such notification, grantor and grantee shall select a mediator to assist in the resolution of the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved through the mediation process within sixty days, grantee may invoke the arbitration procedures under Section 5.16.400 by providing grantor written notice within ten days after the mediation process is terminated.

(Ord. 744 § 2 (part), 1996).  
5.16.410 - Force majeureGrantee's inability to perform. 
If grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise agreement is prevented by a cause or event not within grantee's control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided, however, that such inability to perform shall not relieve a grantee from the obligations imposed by Section 5.16.180(B) pertaining to refunds and credits for interruptions in service. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within the control of grantee shall include without limitation acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, fires, and other unforeseen circumstances, but shall not include financial inability of the grantee to perform or failure of the grantee to obtain any necessary permits or licenses from other governmental agencies or the right to use the facilities of any public utility where such failure is due solely to the acts or omissions of grantee, or the failure of the grantee to secure supplies, services or equipment necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable communications system where the grantee has failed to exercise reasonable diligence to secure such supplies, services or equipment.

Grantor shall notify grantee in writing at least ninety days before initiating any abandonment process with respect to grantee's property. 
B.  Grantor, upon such terms as grantor may impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above ground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from grantor and shall restore any affected street to its former state at the time such facilities and equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles, or attachments. Grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the public ways, public places, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this chapter and the security fund as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by grantee with the terms and conditions of this section. 
C.  Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, the grantee, if required by the grantor, shall submit to the grantor an instrument, satisfactory in form to the grantor, transferring to the grantor the ownership of the franchise property abandoned. 
D.  At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as provided herein, in any such case without renewal, extension or transfer, the grantor shall have the right to require grantee to remove, at its own expense, all above ground portions of the cable television system from all streets and public ways within the city within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty days. 
E.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter or a franchise agreement, the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the street or public rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other cable grantee. Moreover, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter or a franchise agreement, to the extent that any provider of utility services or any services similar to those provided by the grantee is not required to remove its property or otherwise incur expenses under the circumstances provided for in this section, then grantee shall be relieved of such obligation. 
(Ord. 744 § 2 (part), 1996).  
5.16.430 - Restoration by grantorReimbursement of costs. 
If grantee fails to complete any work required herein or by any other law or ordinance, and if such work is not completed within thirty days after receipt of written notice thereof from grantor or, if more than thirty days are reasonably required therefor, if grantee does not commence such work within such thirty day period and diligently complete the work thereafter (except in cases of emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare), grantor may cause such work to be done and grantee shall reimburse grantor the costs thereof within thirty days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs, or grantor may recover such costs through the security fund provided by grantee.

Grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue to receive all available services provided that financial and other obligations to grantee are honored. The grantee shall use reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during transition periods following franchise expiration or termination. 
(Ord. 744 § 2 (part), 1996).  
5.16.450 - Receivership and foreclosure. 
A.  A franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of grantor, to the extent consistent with applicable law, including the federal bankruptcy code, cease and terminate one hundred twenty days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty days, or unless: (1) such receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivership or trustees within said one hundred twenty days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such defaults which is satisfactory to the grantor; and (2) such receivers of trustees shall, within said one hundred twenty days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted. 
B.  In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the franchise property, or any material part thereof, grantor may serve notice of termination upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise granted and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such notice, unless: (1) grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner that this chapter provides; and (2) such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.

(Ord. 744 § 2 (part), 1996).  
5.16.470 - Waiver. 
The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the grantor determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. 
(Ord. 744 § 2 (part), 1996).  
5.16.480 - Separability. 
If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or state law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision thereof which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on grantor and grantee, provided that grantor shall give grantee thirty days written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision of such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for grantee to comply with such provision.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1056, § 1, adopted Sept. 13, 2016, repealed Ch. 5.20 in its entirety, and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 5.20, §§ 5.20.0105.20.220 pertained to massage establishments and massage technicians, and derived from Ord. No. 954, § 1, adopted Sept. 22, 2009. Prior ordinance history: Ords. 453, 494 and 699. 
 
5.20.010 - Purpose and intent. 
It is the purpose and intent of the city of Rocklin to comply with California law while also protecting the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city through the enactment of standards of professional competence and operational requirements which promote the therapeutic use of massage therapy. 
This chapter is not intended to be exclusive and compliance with city regulations will not excuse noncompliance with any state or local laws or regulations that are uniformly applied to other professional or personal services businesses including, without limitation, all zoning applications; business license regulations; building, fire, electrical, and plumbing codes; and health and safety laws and regulations applicable to professional or personal services businesses. 
The California State Legislature implemented uniform statewide regulations pertaining to massage therapy and massage businesses (enacted by AB 1147 in 2014) now codified in Chapter 10.5 of Division 2 of the California Business and Professions Code (commencing at Section 4600 et seq.), hereinafter referred to as the "Massage Therapy Act", which created a statewide system for issuing massage worker permits, thereby preempting local permitting systems and requirements. The statewide permitting system is administered by the California Massage Therapy Council ("CAMTC"). 
The Massage Therapy Act allows local jurisdictions to enforce certain business licensing and to establish reasonable health and safety requirements for massage businesses, not in conflict with the Massage Therapy Act. To enable the city to carry out the local regulation and review of massage businesses found in the Massage Therapy Act, the city must maintain massage business regulations in the Rocklin Municipal Code. 
There is a continued need for local regulations because there is significant risk of injury to massage clients by improperly trained or educated massage service providers and the city has a legitimate interest in providing reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss to such massage clients. Government Code Section 51034 specifically recognizes the powers of cities to regulate massage businesses. In addition, the city wishes to promote the ethical practice of massage therapy and to prevent and discourage the misuse of massage therapy as a front for prostitution activities in violation of the law, including but not limited to subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 647 of the California Penal Code. 
The adoption of qualification standards for massage service providers based upon the CAMTC certification program established under the Massage Therapy Act and the enhancement of the city's reasonable regulations on the operation of massage businesses and the conduct of massage service providers will serve to reduce the risk of potentially injurious and illegal activity. 
This chapter establishes a local regulatory system for massage businesses to operate within the city. This chapter is also intended to allow a transitional period for existing massage businesses to continue operating while their employees obtain state certification by March 1, 2017.

Chapter 5.24 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 
Sections: 
 
5.24.010 - Short title. 
This chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax of the city. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
"Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
"Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
"Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
"Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
"Rent" means the consideration charged whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
"Tax administrator" means the city finance manager, or his or her designee. 
"Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both, prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.030 - Tax imposedGenerally. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of eight percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
The tax administrator may make rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter as may be necessary or desirable to aid in the enforcement and administration of this chapter. Any such rule or regulation that may affect the amount of tax owed the city shall be subject to approval of the city council. The rules and regulations shall be filed in the office of the tax administrator and maintained in an orderly and readily accessible manner. Taxes are considered paid only upon receipt of the return, and penalty, interest, and completed exemption certificate when appropriate. The burden to secure and comply with the rules and regulations shall be upon the operator. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.040 - Exemptions. 
No tax shall be imposed upon any person if the imposition is beyond the power of the city as herein provided. Without limitation, the following are specifically exempt: 
Any federal or state employee when on official business. 
Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. 
No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. When a claim of exemption is defective, the operator: (i) shall be responsible for all taxes due with respect to the purported exempt transient; and (ii) the tax administrator shall give notice to the operator of all taxes due as a result of rejection of the exemption claims. The operator shall pay all sums due within ten working days of notification. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.050 - Operator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment of the tax from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.060 - Registration. 
Within thirty days after commencing business each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him or her a "transient occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
No reports or statements of an operator shall be conclusive as to any matter affected by this chapter, nor shall the city be precluded from collecting any sum actually due and payable. Each report or statement and each of the items therein are subject to audit and verification pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.080 - Uncollectible accountsRelief of operator from liability. 
An operator is relieved from liability for the remission to the city of the tax imposed under this chapter insofar as the measure of the tax is represented by accounts which have been found to be worthless and charged off for income tax purposes. If the operator has previously remitted the tax, he or she may, pursuant to procedures prescribed by the tax administrator, take as a deduction the amount of tax previously remitted for the worthless and charged off account. If any such accounts are thereafter in whole or in part collected by the operator, the amount so collected shall be included in the first return filed after such collection and the tax on such amount paid with the return. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.090 - Penalties and interest. 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
B.  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance (including accrued and unpaid penalties and interest) on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax (including accrued and unpaid penalties and interest) in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section, and in addition to any other remedy available to the city in law or in equity, and in addition to any criminal liability. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.100 - Failure to collect and report taxDetermination of tax by tax administrator. 
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax under this chapter and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report, and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. 
In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 5.24.110 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.110 - Appeal. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.120 - RecordsAudit. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city. 
The tax administrator may require any operator, upon reasonable written notice, to provide the tax administrator with access to all of the operator's books and records relating to the operator's operation of the hotel, including rents charged by such operator that are subject to a tax pursuant to this chapter. If, as a result of any such audit, it is determined that a return required to be filed by such operator pursuant to Section 5.24.070 hereof is inaccurate and did not include and report the correct amount of tax due pursuant to this chapter, the operator shall forthwith pay to the city all taxes that are shown to be due as a result of such audit, regardless of whether the operator collected such taxes. 
If an audit conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section reflects that in any calendar month there was under-reporting of taxes due by five percent or more, which under-reporting was not corrected by the operator prior to the commencement of the audit, all costs associated with the audit shall be borne by the operator, and the cost thereof shall be subject to collection as a civil debt by the city. For this purpose, costs shall include all consultant costs, all staff costs, and other expenses incurred by the city. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.130 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section; provided, that a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.140 - City remedies. 
In addition to and cumulative with the penalties and interest specified in Section 5.24.090, the city shall have available to it any remedy specified in federal, state, or local law, including but not limited to those specified in this section. 
A.  Civil Action. 
1.  Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. Nothing in this section, or in any other section of this chapter, shall alter or otherwise affect the operator's status as a trustee of public funds in the operator's hands with respect to taxes collected by the operator under the provisions of this chapter, or its liability as a trustee. The city shall have the discretion to bring civil action on the basis that the tax collected is a debt of the operator, or on the basis that the operator has violated its fiduciary duty as trustee, or on both of those bases, or on any other basis available under this ordinance or otherwise. 
2.  If a civil action is required to enforce the collection of a tax from any person, and a recovery of such tax in any amount is granted in such a civil judicial proceeding, the city shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and its costs of the administrative process under this chapter, including, but not limited to other direct and indirect costs incurred by the city with reference to such litigation. 
3.  An action to collect the transient occupancy tax must be commenced within three years of the date the transient occupancy tax becomes delinquent. An action to collect the penalty for nonpayment of the transient occupancy tax must be commenced within three years of the date the penalty accrues. 
B.  Criminal Enforcement. 
1.  Unless provided otherwise, any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as provided in Title 1 of this code. 
2.  Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, or who refuses to provide the tax administrator with access to the written records required to be kept by this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
3.  Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
4.  Pursuant to the provisions of California Penal Code Section 836.5, any officer or employee of the administrative services department of the city holding the position of finance manager or senior administrative analyst may enforce the provisions of this chapter by requesting that the Rocklin Police Department issue a criminal citation to a person or arrest a person without a warrant whenever that officer or employee has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a misdemeanor in his or her presence which is a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. The police officer acting under the authority of this section shall follow the citation-release procedures prescribed in Chapter 5C, Title 3, Part 2 of the California Penal Code (sections 853.5, et seq.) or such procedure hereafter enacted by the state of California. 
C.  Security. 
The tax administrator, whenever he or she deems it necessary to insure compliance with this chapter, may require any operator to post such security as the tax administrator, in his or her sole discretion, may determine to be reasonable. The amount of the security shall be fixed by the tax administrator, but, except as noted below, shall not be greater than twice the estimated average liability of operators filing returns pursuant to Section 5.24.070 or fifty thousand dollars, whichever amount is the lesser. The limitations provided in this chapter apply regardless of the type of security placed with the tax administrator, which shall be determined in the sole and exclusive discretion of the tax administrator. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the tax administrator subject to the limitations provided in this chapter. The tax administrator may sell the security at public auction if it becomes necessary to do so to recover any tax or amount required to be collected, or interest, or penalty due. Notice of the sale may be served upon the person who placed the security personally or by mail; if by mail, service shall be addressed to the person at his or her address as it appears in the records of the tax administrator. Security in the form of a bearer bond issued by the United States or the state, and which has a prevailing market price may, however, be sold by the tax administrator at private sale at a price not lower than the prevailing market price thereof. Upon any sale any surplus above the amounts due shall be returned to the person who placed the security. 
D.  Lien. 
1.  If any tax is not paid when due, the tax administrator may, within three years after the amount is due, record in the office of the county recorder of such counties as the tax administrator may determine, a certificate of lien which specifies the amount of tax due and the name and address of the operator owning the tax. The certificate shall include a statement that the tax administrator has complied with all legal requirements in the determination of the tax owed, and a legal description of the property of the owner. Upon recording the certificate, the tax, together with any accumulated penalties and interest, constitutes a lien upon all real property owned or thereafter acquired by the operator. The lien has the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien, and shall continue for ten years from the time of filling of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. 
2.  At any time after the recording of a certificate of lien, the tax administrator may issue a check or warrant directed to any sheriff or marshal for the enforcement of the lien and the collection of the tax. The warrant shall have the same effect as a writ of execution, and be executed in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy and sale pursuant to writ of execution. The tax administrator may pay or advance to the sheriff or marshal such fees, commissions, and expenses for services as are provided by law. 
3.  Priority of Lien. The amounts required to be remitted and/or paid by any operator under this chapter with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases: (i) whenever the operator is insolvent; (ii) whenever the operator makes a voluntary assignment of his or her assets; (iii) whenever the estate of the operator in the hands of executors, administrators, or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased; and (iv) whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent operator required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied upon by process of law. This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien that is filed prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien. The preference given to the city by this section shall be subordinate to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Sections 1204 and 1206 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. 
E.  Seizure and Sale. At any time within three years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount, the tax administrator may collect the amount in the following manner: the tax administrator shall seize any property, real or personal, of the operator and sell the property, or a sufficient part of it, at public auction to pay the amount due together with any penalties and interest imposed for the delinquency and any costs incurred on account of the seizure and sale. Any seizure made to collect occupancy taxes shall be only of property of the operator not exempt from execution under the provisions of the California Code of Civil Procedure. 
F.  Successor Liability. 
1.  If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells his or her business or quits the business, a successor or assignee shall withhold sufficient funds from the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that the tax has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. 
2.  If a purchaser of a hotel fails to withhold funds from the purchase price as required, he or she shall become personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within sixty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within sixty days from the date the former owner's records are made available for audit, whichever period expires the later, but in any event not later than ninety days after receiving the request, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his or her address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Failure of the tax administrator to mail the notice shall release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of the successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells the business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs the later. 
3.  Sale of a hotel, dismissal of the operator, or other termination of the operator's rights to operate the facility shall not relieve him or her from liability for taxes due or owing under this chapter. 
G.  Withhold Notice. If any operator is delinquent in the remittance or payment of the amount required to be remitted or paid by him or her when a tax, penalty, and interest determination has been made by the tax administrator as provided in this chapter, the city may, within three years after the tax obligation became due, deliver a withholding notice personally or by registered mail to any or all persons, including the state or any local government or agency, having in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the taxpayer. After receiving the withholding notice, the person so notified shall make no disposition of the taxpayer's credits, other personal property, or debts, until the city consents to a transfer or disposition or until sixty days elapse after the receipt of the notice, whichever expires earlier. All persons, upon receipt of the notice, shall advise the city immediately of all such credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owning by them. If such notices seek to prevent the transfer or other disposition of a deposit in a bank or other credits or personal property or under the control of the bank, to be effective the notice shall be delivered or mailed to the branch or office of such bank at which the deposit is carried or at which such credits or personal property is held. If any person so notified makes transfer or disposition of the property or debts required to be held hereunder during the effective period of the notice to withhold, he or she shall be liable to the city to the extent of the value of the amount transferred or disposed up to the amount of the indebtedness owed by the taxpayer to the city. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.150 - Use of tax receipts. 
The tax administrator shall pay into the treasury all moneys, including taxes and penalties, collected by him or her pursuant to this chapter for deposit to the city general fund, to be used for general municipal purposes. 
(Ord. 879 Exh. A (part), 2003).  
5.24.160 - Privacy rights. 
It is unlawful for any person having an administrative duty relating to the tax under this chapter, to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an investigation of the records of any operator or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth or disclosed in any return, or to knowingly permit any return or copy thereof or any abstract or particular thereof to be seen or examined by any person. Successors, receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, may be given information as to the items included in the amounts of any unpaid tax or amounts of tax, penalties, and interest required to be collected. An operator may, by request made to the tax administrator, designate a person to whom information specified in this section may be released. The request shall be in writing and shall specify the information that the tax administrator shall be authorized to release.

The issuance of permits shall be determined by the fire chief as follows: 
A.  To be eligible for a permit, a preliminary application for a permit must be filed with the fire chief between February 1 to February 28 of each calendar year. A maximum of twenty permits shall be issued. The twenty nonprofit organizations which were granted permits in 2013 will be given a "grandfather provision" and will be given the opportunity to obtain a permit as long as they meet the requirements of Section 8.24.060. If the number of qualified applications from the "grandfather provision" is less than twenty, the fire chief shall conduct a random lottery drawing for the remaining permits no later than March 5. The "grandfather provision" status of the twenty nonprofit organizations will remain in effect as long as there is no lapse in continuous years of participation. If a lapse in continuous years of participation by a "grandfathered" nonprofit organization occurs, the permit will be issued through the random lottery drawing. If an original "grandfathered" nonprofit organization decides to participate again in subsequent years, they shall obtain a permit through the random lottery process. 
B.  After the authorized number of permits has been drawn, one applicant shall be drawn as the first alternate and one applicant shall be drawn as the second alternate. The alternates shall be offered a permit if one of the original permittees cannot meet the requirements of this section or if a permittee voluntarily surrenders the permit.

Chapter 8.30 - STORMWATER RUNOFF POLLUTION CONTROL 
Sections: 
 
8.30.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to ensure the health, safety and general welfare of Rocklin residents; to protect water resources and to improve water quality; to cause the use of management practices by the city and its citizens that will reduce the adverse effects of polluted runoff discharges on waters of the state; to secure benefits from the use of stormwater as a resource; and to ensure the city is compliant with applicable state and federal law. This chapter seeks to promote these purposes by: 
A.  Prohibiting illicit discharges to the stormwater conveyance system; 
B.  Establishing authority to adopt minimum requirements for stormwater management, including source control requirements, to prevent and reduce pollution; 
C.  Establishing authority to adopt requirements for development project site design, to reduce stormwater pollution and erosion both during construction and after project is complete; 
D.  Establishing authority to adopt requirements for the management of stormwater flows from development projects, both to prevent erosion and to protect and enhance existing water-dependent habitats; 
E.  Establishing authority to adopt standards for the use of off-site facilities for stormwater management to supplement on-site practices at new development sites. 
(Ord. 901 § 1 (part), 2005).  
8.30.020 - Definitions. 
The following words, when used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings: 
A.  "Best management practices (BMPs)" mean schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, general good housekeeping practices, pollution prevention and educational practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to stormwater, receiving waters, or stormwater conveyance systems. BMPs also include treatment practices, operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal, or drainage from raw materials storage. 
B.  "City" means the city of Rocklin.

Chapter 8.34 - PROHIBITING MARIJUANA USE ON PUBLIC PROPERTY 
 
8.34.010 - Applicability. 
This chapter adopts regulations associated with publicly owned, leased and rented properties in the city of Rocklin. This chapter shall not apply to private property. 
(Ord. No. 1058, § 2, 11-8-2016; Ord. No. 1059, § 2, 11-8-2016)  
8.34.020 - Findings. 
The city council hereby finds as follows: 
A.  Smoking marijuana is likely to have the same, similar or worse health consequences as use of other smoking products and it is known that smoking tobacco products is one of the largest single preventable causes of death and disability for persons in the United States. On average, compared to people who have never smoked, smokers suffer more health problems and disability due to their smoking and ultimately lose more than a decade of life. 
B.  Exposure to secondhand smoke is a leading cause of preventable death, after smoking and alcohol. It has been found by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be a Class A Carcinogen, known to cause cancer in humans, and one out of three cancer deaths are reportedly caused by smoking. There is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. 
C.  The city is aware of findings associated with tobacco smoke and is aware of studies that suggest or state that smoking of marijuana has many harmful effects and other studies, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse show that marijuana use can be hazardous to memory, brain function, pregnant women, juveniles, those with respiratory diseases, cause higher rates of cancer than tobacco and other harmful effects. Hazards known as a result of tobacco smoke which are likely to carry over to marijuana smoke include: 
1.  Secondhand smoke causes numerous health problems in infants and children, including more frequent and severe asthma attacks, respiratory infections, ear infections, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). 
2.  Smoking is one of the largest single preventable causes of death and disability for persons in the United States. 
3.  Employees subject to prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace experience a loss of job productivity and may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of reactions to secondhand smoke. Higher costs to the employer are associated with smoke in the workplace due to increase in absenteeism, accidents, and the cost of medical care, insurance, loss of productivity, and cleaning and maintenance requirements. Smoke-free workplaces are associated with an increase in the success rate of smokers who are attempting to quit. 
D.  Smoking, including marijuana in public places can be a major cause of fires and damage to merchandise and equipment as well as costly maintenance and repairs to furniture and fixtures. 
E.  Many people may be very opposed to being exposed to marijuana smoke due to sobriety, job related drug testing and other personal reasons. People frequenting or using public property in the city may not wish to be exposed to marijuana smoke and should not be otherwise exposed against their free will. 
F.  Proposition 64 on the November 2016 ballot includes a provision (Health and Safety Code Section 11362.3) that states that nothing in that law permits a person to smoke or ingest marijuana in a "public place" but no definition of "public place" is provided. The city seeks to make clear that smoking of or ingestion of marijuana on all its city streets, sidewalks, public property, recreation areas and sports arenas is prohibited.

(Ord. No. 1101, § 3, 8-14-2018)  
9.01.030 - Procedure for filing an appeal. 
A.  Appeal to City Manager. If a party is aggrieved of an administrative decision under this Title 9, they may appeal the decision to the city manager by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen calendar days after the date upon which the written administrative decision was deposited in the U.S. mail. The notice of appeal shall contain a statement of the grounds to be relied upon for reversing the decision being appealed. In the event the last calendar day of the filing period falls on a non-business day, the appeal period shall be extended to include the next business day. In the absence of a timely appeal and the payment of any applicable appeal fee, the original administrative decision shall be final. 
The city manager shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal not later than forty-five calendar days after the notice of appeal is received. At least ten calendar days' notice shall be given to the appellant of the time and place of the hearing by serving the notice personally or by depositing it in the United States mail to the address provided by appellant in his/her notice of appeal.

Persons denied a permit or otherwise aggrieved by a determination of a city official under this title may meet and/or confer with the city official who issued the decision or the appropriate department head in an effort to informally resolve the matter. Such efforts to informally resolve the matter do not extend the time for filing a formal appeal under subsection A above. In the event the matter is informally resolved prior to the hearing date set by the city manager, the city will refund any appeals fees paid provided the appellant has withdrawn their formal appeal. 
C.  Appeal to City Council. The decision of the city manager may be appealed to the city council by filing a notice of appeal containing appellant's grounds for appeal with the city clerk within fifteen calendar days after the date upon which the city manager's decision is made.

The city clerk shall fix a time and place for the city council hearing of such appeal not later than forty-five calendar days after the notice of appeal is received. At least ten calendar days' notice shall be given to the appellant of the time and place of the hearing by serving the notice personally or by depositing it in the United States mail to the address provided by appellant in his/her notice of appeal. 
At such hearing before the city council, the appellant shall show cause on the grounds specified in the notice of appeal why the action appealed from should be reversed. The city council may continue the hearing from time to time; provided, however, that the hearing shall occur and be concluded no later than thirty calendar days after the original date set for hearing. The city council shall render a written decision within fifteen calendar days of the conclusion of the hearing and its decision to affirm, reject or modify the decision of the city manager shall be final and subject to judicial review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.8.

(Ord. 425 § 1, 1980).  
9.04.020 - Definitions. 
A.  "Organized athletic event" means any sporting contest (or practice by a team to compete in such a contest) which contest or practice involves participation by minors who are organized into teams which play on a regular basis against similar teams. 
B.  "Park" means any park, reservation, playground, or other area in the city owned or used by the city and devoted to recreation use by the public. 
(Ord. 425 § 2, 1980).  
9.04.030 - Restricted near organized athletic events involving minors. 
Whenever an organized athletic event involving minors is in progress within a park, it is unlawful for any person to sell or consume alcoholic beverages within three hundred feet of the boundaries of the playing field upon which the organized athletic event is being conducted except when such sale or consumption takes place within an enclosed building. 
(Ord. 425 § 3, 1980).  
9.04.040 - Drinking in public streets, sidewalks, and alleys. 
It is unlawful for any person to drink alcoholic beverages upon any public street, sidewalk, or alley in the city. 
(Ord. 616 § 1, 1990).  
9.04.050 - Possession of open alcoholic beverage container on posted premises. 
A.  As used in this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
1.  "Posted premises" means premises subject to state licensure as a retail package off-sale alcoholic beverage licensee, any parking lot immediately adjacent to such premises, and any public sidewalk immediately adjacent to such premises, and on which premises at least one clearly visible notice indicates to the patrons of the licensee, and the parking lot, and to persons on the public sidewalk, that the provisions of this section are applicable.

Chapter 9.08 - DRUG PARAPHERNALIA SALE AND DISPLAY 
Sections: 
 
9.08.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to discourage the illegal use of controlled substances that create serious social, medical and law enforcement problems within the city. 
B.  The permitted display of drug paraphernalia in retail stores and the distribution of such paraphernalia symbolizes a public tolerance that intensifies and compounds the problem of the illegal use of controlled substances within our community. 
Therefore, this chapter is directed towards the public display and sales of paraphernalia intended for use with illicit controlled substances. 
(Ord. 436 § 1, 1980).  
9.08.020 - Age-related prohibition impractical. 
A.  A ban only upon the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia to persons under eighteen years of age would not be practical. The person who displays or distributes such matter would have difficulty determining who could lawfully view or receive drug paraphernalia. The police department would be subjected to an intolerable enforcement burden by adding age as an element of a prohibition upon display and distribution. A significant number of high school students are eighteen years of age or older. With an age-related prohibition, it would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students would be prohibited. Permitted display and distribution to adults within the community would symbolize a public tolerance of illegal drug use, making it difficult to explain the rationale of programs directed against similar abuse by youth. The problem of illegal consumption of controlled substances by adults within this community is significant and substantial, necessitating a cessation of the encouragement to drug abuse which the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia create. 
This chapter is necessary in order to discourage the illegal use of controlled substances within the city. 
(Ord. 444 § 1, 1981: Ord. 436 § 1A, 1980).  
9.08.030 - Definitions.

C.  "Display" means to show to a patron or place in a manner so as to be available for viewing or inspection by a patron. 
D.  "Distribute" means to transfer ownership or a possessory interest to another, whether for consideration or as a gratuity. "Distribute" includes both sales and gifts. 
E.  1.  "Drug paraphernalia" means all equipment, products, and materials of any kind which are intended by a person charged with a violation of this chapter, for use in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repacking, storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance in violation of any law of the state of California.

2.  Water pipes; 
3.  Carburetion tubes and devices; 
4.  Smoking and carburetion masks;

(Ord. 436 § 3, 1980).

Editor's note Ord. No. 1077, § 3, adopted Aug. 8, 2017, amended Ch. 9.24 in its entirety, and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 9.24, §§ 9.24.0109.24.070 pertained to camping on public property, and derived from Ord. No. 1074, § 3 adopted July 11, 2017. See the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for a complete derivation. 
 
9.24.010 - Purpose. 
The streets and public property within the city of Rocklin should be readily accessible and available to residents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes or storage of personal property interferes with the rights of others to make use of these areas for their proper function. Such activity can constitute a public health and safety hazard that adversely impacts neighborhoods, commercial property and the general welfare of the city. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain streets, parks and other public property, and private lands, within the city in a clean, sanitary and accessible condition and to adequately protect the health, safety and public welfare of the community, while recognizing that, subject to reasonable conditions, camping associated with special events can be beneficial to the cultural and educational climate in the city.

Chapter 9.32 - GRAFFITI ABATEMENT 
Sections: 
 
9.32.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The city council finds that graffiti on public or private property is a cause of blight which depreciates not only the value of the property defaced, but also the value of adjacent and surrounding properties, creating a negative impact upon the entire city. 
Graffiti is also a means of identification utilized by gangs. Graffiti encourages further gang-related activities. Graffiti creates fear within the community and blight upon the urban landscape. It devalues property and detracts from the sense of community enjoyed by the residents of Rocklin. Graffiti is both a crime against property and a social crime against the quality of life and freedom from intimidation citizens desire in their neighborhoods. Graffiti is vandalism and is prohibited by Penal Code Section 594, et seq., and Section 640.6. 
California Government Code Section 53069.3 authorizes the city, under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti and other inscribed materials from private as well as public property. The council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance and unless the city causes it to be removed from public and private property, it tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the result that entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be. 
It is the purpose and intent of the city council, through the adoption of this chapter, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of vandalism and defacement, including the application of graffiti on privately and publicly owned walls and structures. It is the further intent of the city council, through the adoption of this chapter, to advise all of those who disregard the property rights of others, that the law enforcement agencies of the city, county and the district attorney's office will strictly enforce the law and vigorously prosecute those persons engaging in the defacement of public and private properties.

9.40.020 - Purpose and intent. 
The city of Rocklin finds and determines police officers, in response to complaints, are often required to make several return trips to a location of a disturbance causing loud and unreasonable noise in order to disperse uncooperative participants. The return of police officers to a location constitutes a drain of personnel and resources often leaving other areas of the city without minimal levels of police protection. This creates a significant hazard to the safety of the police officers and to the public in general. 
(Ord. 865 § 1 (part), 2002).  
9.40.030 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

C.  "Person responsible for the disturbance" or "responsible person" is the person causing the disturbance, the person who owns or is in charge of the property where the disturbance takes place, and the person who organized the event or activity causing the disturbance. If the person responsible for the disturbance is a minor, then the parents or guardians of that minor will be jointly and severally liable for the costs incurred for police services. 
(Ord. 865 § 1 (part), 2002).  
9.40.040 - Liability for cost of police services at disturbances requiring more than one response. 
When police personnel respond to any location due to a disturbance, the responding officers may issue a written warning to the responsible person. The notice shall state that if police department personnel are required to return to the same location within the following twelve hour period because of similar or continuing disturbances, such further response shall constitute special security services. Further, this warning shall state that the responsible person may be charged for the cost of providing such special security services. The warning shall be offered for signature to the responsible person. The warning shall be signed by the responsible person, or, if the responsible person refuses to sign, the words "refused to sign" shall be entered on the warning acknowledging receipt of the warning. A copy of the warning shall be left with the responsible person. If a second or subsequent response is required, police department personnel shall have the responsible person sign a second response voucher. If the responsible person refuses to sign, the words "refused to sign" shall be entered on the voucher acknowledging the occurrence of the second response. A copy of the voucher shall be left with the responsible person. 
(Ord. 865 § 1 (part), 2002).  
9.40.050 - Cost of police services. 
The cost of police services charged to persons responsible for a disturbance under this chapter shall be calculated using the cost reasonably borne to provide the service determined under Chapter 3.32 and actual cost of medical treatment and damages to equipment. The amount charged shall be deemed a debt to the city of the person(s) responsible for the disturbance and, if minors, their parents or guardians. Any person owing money shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the city for recovery of such amount, including reasonable attorney fees. 
(Ord. 865 § 1 (part), 2002).  
9.40.060 - Effect on criminal prosecution. 
Nothing in the adoption or administration of this chapter shall be construed as affecting the ability to initiate or continue concurrent or subsequent criminal prosecution for any violation of the provisions of this code or any state law arising out of the same circumstances necessitating the application of this chapter. 
(Ord. 865 § 1 (part), 2002).  
Chapter 9.42 - SOCIAL HOST ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
9.42.010 - Purpose and intent.

B.  Except as provided in Section 9.42.040(G) below, whenever a person having ownership or control of a premises is on the premises and allows a minor to possess or consume any alcoholic beverage, marijuana or controlled substance thereon, it shall be prima facie evidence that such person had the requisite knowledge specified in subsection (A). 
C.  A social host shall be deemed to have constructive knowledge that a minor has consumed or possessed alcoholic beverages, marijuana or controlled substances if the social host did not take reasonable steps to prevent the consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages, marijuana and controlled substances by minors. 
D.  A social host shall not be in violation of this section if he or she seeks immediate assistance from any law enforcement agency to remove any person who refuses to abide by the social hosts' performance of the duties imposed by this chapter, or to terminate the gathering because the social host has been unable to prevent minors from consuming or possessing alcoholic beverages, marijuana or other controlled substances despite having taken reasonable steps to do so.

10.10.020 - Changes in speed limits. 
A.  Speed Limit Increases. Whenever the city council determines, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, that a speed greater than twenty-five miles per hour would facilitate the orderly movement of vehicular traffic and would be reasonable and safe upon any street other than a state highway otherwise subject to a prima facie speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour, the city council may, by ordinance, declare a prima facie maximum speed limit of thirty, thirty-five, forty, forty-five, fifty, fifty-five, sixty or a maximum of sixty-five miles per hour, whichever is found the most appropriate to facilitate the orderly movement of vehicular traffic and is reasonable and safe.

Whenever the city council determines, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, that the limit of sixty-five miles per hour is more than is reasonable or safe upon any portion of a highway other than a state highway for a distance of not exceeding two thousand feet in length between districts, either business or residence, the city council may declare a reasonable and safe prima facie speed limit thereon lower than sixty-five miles per hour, but not less than twenty-five miles per hour. 
3.  Whenever the city council determines, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, that the speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour in a business or residence district or in a public park on any street having a roadway not exceeding twenty-five feet in width, other than a state highway, is more than is reasonable or safe, the city council may, by ordinance or resolution, determine and declare a prima facie speed limit of fifteen or twenty miles per hour, whichever is found most appropriate and is reasonable and safe. 
4.  Whenever the city council determines, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, that the speed limit of twenty-five miles per hour when passing school buildings or grounds as established by Vehicle Code section 22352 is more than is reasonable or safe, the city council may, by ordinance or resolution, determine and declare a prima facie speed limit of fifteen or twenty miles per hour, whichever is justified as the appropriate speed limit by such survey. 
C.  Speed limits established pursuant to this section shall be effective when appropriate signs giving notice there are erected upon said street or highway. 
(Ord. No. 1106, § 3, 10-23-2018)

Chapter 15.16 - FLOOD HAZARD AREAS[2] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 967, § 1, adopted Jan. 25, 2011, repealed the former Ch. 15.16, §§ 15.16.01015.16.160, and enacted a new Ch. 15.16 as set out herein. The former Ch. 15.16 pertained to similar subject matter. For complete derivation see the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
 
15.16.010 - Statutory authority. 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by the accumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damaged uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses. 
C.  Regulations of "area of special flood hazard" is necessary because of the compelling need to insure safety and availability of flood insurance to the residents of the city, in that the government of the United States, through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, required these regulations to be adopted before flood insurance can be obtained by residents. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
"A zone" - see "Special flood hazard area". 
"Accessory structure" means a structure that is either: 
1.  Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or 
2.  A small, low cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred fifty square feet and one thousand five hundred dollars in value.

Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
"Area of special flood hazard" - See "Special flood hazard area". 
"Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one hundred-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
"Base flood elevation" (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade - i.e., below ground level - on all sides. 
"Building" - see "Structure". 
"City engineer" means a registered civil engineer (California) employed by the city to perform statutory functions of city engineer. 
"Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of this chapter. 
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
"Flood, flooding, or floodwater" means: 
1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
2.  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
"Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the city. 
"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see "Flood, flooding, or floodwater". 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-08, TB 2-08, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot; also referred to as "Regulatory Floodway". 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "Regulatory Floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.16.250 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Hardship" as related to Section 15.16.250 of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The flood openings standard in Section 15.16.170.C.3; 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.16.170.A; 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.16.170.B; and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.16.180. 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
"Market value" is defined in the city substantial damage/improvement procedures. See Section 15.16.140.B.1. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
"New construction", for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of this chapter. 
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
"One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" - see "Base flood." 
"Program deficiency" means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. 
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 15.16.250 of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Sheet flow area" - see "Area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas. 
"Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.060 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the June 8, 1998 "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for city of Rocklin", with accompanying June 8, 1998 Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM's) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM's) and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended by the city engineer. The study, FIRM's and FBFM's are on file at the engineering division of the community development in the city. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.080 - Compliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.100 - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
B.  Liberally construed in favor of the city; and 
C.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.110 - Warnings and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.120 - Severability. 
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.130 - Designation of the city engineer. 
The city engineer is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the city engineer. 
The duties and responsibilities of the city engineer shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all flood zone development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city; and 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
C.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.16.070, the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 15.16.170. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the city engineer shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Section 15.16.170.C.1 and Section 15.16.200 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.16.170.C.2 (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Section 15.16.170.C.3 (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 15.16.190.A.3 (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 15.16.240.B (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.16.160. 
G.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.16.080. 
H.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
I.  Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.150 - Flood zone development permit.

2.  Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in Section 15.16.170. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.180 - Standards for utilities. 
A.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
1.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
2.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
B.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.190 - Standards for subdivisions and other proposed development. 
A.  All new subdivisions proposals and other proposed development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall: 
1.  Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood elevations (BFE). 
2.  Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures and pads on the final plans. 
3.  If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the city engineer: 
a.  Lowest floor elevation.

(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.200 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall: 
1.  Within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to at least two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of Section 15.16.200.A will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least two feet above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.210 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
A.  All recreational vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; or 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.16.150 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.16.200.A.1. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.220 - Easements. 
A.  No final map or parcel map shall be approved and no building permit shall be issued for any property abutting any flood zone until the owner thereof conveys to the city for recordation on the official records of Placer County, an easement on, over and across that portion of the property as shown to be within the flood zone. The easement shall expressly waive reimbursement or compensation for any improvements within such flood zone destroyed or damaged by the city, its agent or employees in the course of carrying out any of such purposes. Such purposes shall be: 
1.  Inspection; 
2.  Maintenance for flood prevention; and 
3.  Flood abatement. 
B.  Legal Description. The legal description contained in the easement shall be reviewed by the city engineer to determine whether or not the conveyance meets the requirements of this chapter. Any controversy between the city engineer and the property owner concerning the proper area to be covered by the easement may be resolved by an appeal by either the property owner or the city engineer, to the city council. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.230 - Protection of waterways. 
A.  Every person, firm, corporation or public agency through whose property an area of special flood hazard exists, shall keep the same free from obstructions which will prevent, change or retard the flow of the water unless a permit to alter such area of special flood hazard has been obtained pursuant to the terms of this chapter. 
B.  No person, except authorized city personnel performing those functions specified in this chapter, shall do any of the following within the flood zone without first obtaining a flood zone development permit from the city: 
1.  Make any excavation; 
2.  Construct or alter any embankment; 
3.  Construct, place, plant or maintain any structure, obstruction, trees, plants, debris or fill which will retard or change the flow of surface waters or floodwaters; or 
4.  Construct or place any outlet for discharging drainage waters. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.240 - Floodways. 
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If Sections 15.16.200.A and B are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.16.170. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.250 - Nature of variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.260 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.16.130 through 15.16.240 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.16.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon a finding by the council of the following: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance or conflict with existing local laws or chapters; and 
3.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; or inconvenience, aesthetic considerations or personal preferences; or problems which can be resolved through alternative means, even though the alternative is more expensive or requires the parcel to be put to a use different than originally intended, do not constitute "exceptional hardship." 
F.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the city engineer in the Office of the Placer County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The city clerk will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 967, § 2, 1-25-2011)  
15.16.270 - Appeal board. 
A.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals. 
B.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
C.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

Chapter 15.18 - STREET AND FRONTAGE IMPROVEMENTS 
Sections: 
 
15.18.010 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
A.  "Block" means property facing or abutting one side of any public street between the next intersecting streets or between the terminus of a dedicated right-of-way of a street and an intersecting street. 
B.  "Development" means: 
1.  The construction of any structure upon any parcel of vacant land abutting a public street, which structure is intended or designed for human use or occupancy; or 
2.  The moving of any structure onto any parcel of vacant land abutting a public street, which structure is intended or designed for human use or occupancy; or 
3.  The modification or reconstruction of any existing structure on any parcel of land abutting a public street, which modifications or reconstruction will increase traffic or impose a greater need for street improvements. For the purposes of this subdivision, the following modifications or reconstruction shall be deemed to be development which will not increase traffic or impose a greater need for street improvements and for which the requirements of this chapter shall not apply: 
a.  In the case of a multifamily residential, commercial or industrial structure, where the cost of such modification or reconstruction is ten thousand dollars or less, provided there is no change in use; or 
b.  In the case of a single-family residential structure, where the cost of such modification or reconstruction is five thousand dollars or less. 
At the commencement of each fiscal year, the amounts in paragraphs a and b shall be adjusted by the city manager to reflect the annual change in the Consumer Price Index, and such adjusted figures shall be filed with the city manager and building department and shall be available to all applicants for building permits. 
If the structure has been modified or reconstructed within the preceding three calendar years, the cost of modification or reconstruction shall be added to the cost of the modification or reconstruction in any permit application to determine the cost amounts in paragraphs a and b. 
C.  "Driveway" means a paved portion of a public street providing an obstructed passage from the roadway to an off-street area used for driving, servicing, parking or otherwise accommodating motor vehicles. 
D.  "Frontage improvements" means and includes sidewalks, curbs, gutters, driveways and pavement to the centerline of the street or streets which are applicable to the parcel of land for which a permit is applied, and shall include as to such parcel its pro rata share of any extension of such improvements in the block as may be reasonably necessary to connect such improvements with existing frontage improvements at the next intersecting street. 
(Ord. 496 § 4, 1983; Ord. 413 § 2, 1980).  
15.18.020 - Frontage improvements requiredExceptions. 
No permit or approval for the development of any parcel of land abutting a public street shall be issued or granted unless: 
A.  Frontage improvements have been installed and approved in accordance with improvement standards adopted by resolution of the council; or 
B.  The owner of the parcel enters into a written agreement with the city for installation of such improvements and furnishes improvement security, in an amount and in a form approved by the city engineer, to guarantee performance of the agreement; or 
C.  A deferral has been granted pursuant to Section 15.18.030; or 
D.  An agreement has been executed pursuant to Sections 15.18.040 or 15.18.060 through 15.18.110; or 
E.  A variance has been granted pursuant to Section 15.18.050; or 
F.  An agreement with the city for installation of frontage improvements under prior Ordinance No. 345 or previous similar ordinances has been executed or a deferral or variance under such prior ordinances has been granted. 
(Ord. 413 § 3, 1980).  
15.18.030 - DeferralPayment in lieu of installation. 
The council may, if it finds that practical difficulties or extenuating circumstances exist, or that the requirements of Section 1 of the ordinance codified in this chapter, which repeals Ordinance No. 345, would impose an unreasonable burden on the property owner or permittee, delay the installation of such frontage improvements until such time as more than fifty percent of the total frontage of the block within which the parcel is located has been improved, or until such time as the owners of more than sixty percent of the frontage of the block within which the parcel is located have either agreed in writing to install the frontage improvements or have filed a petition with the clerk requesting such improvements. 
As an alternative, the council may require the permittee to pay, in lieu of installation of frontage improvements, a fee equivalent to the estimated costs of such improvements at the projected time of their installation, to be deposited in a special account for the construction of such improvements, provided that such improvements must be constructed within a reasonable time thereafter. If the actual costs of the installation of the improvements is less than the amount of the fees paid, the balance shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(Ord. 413 § 4, 1980).  
15.18.040 - Agreement to join in future financing. 
A.  Notwithstanding Section 15.18.020, where a building permit is requested to construct a residential structure on a validly created parcel of sufficient size for the zone in which the property is located, as prescribed by Title 17, and the parcel is located within the boundaries of that area shown in Exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city manager or his duly authorized representative may issue the building permit when the owner of the property executes an agreement with the city that the owner, and his heirs, successors and assigns, waive any protest to the formation of an assessment district, or other reasonable financing arrangement, whereby the improvements specified by this chapter will be installed at a future date. 
B.  The city manager is authorized to execute such agreements on behalf of the city, and the clerk is authorized to record the same. 
C.  The purpose of this section is: 
1.  To alleviate the problem of requiring the installation of improvements on a parcel-by-parcel basis in older areas of the city where it is impractical to do so; and 
2.  To permit areas of sufficient size to be improved under an assessment district or other equitable financing arrangement in order to: 
a.  Lower costs to individual parcels, and/or 
b.  Provide for uniform engineering throughout the older areas of the city. 
(Ord. 538 §§ 1, 2, 1985; Ord. 413 § 5, 1980).  
15.18.050 - Variance. 
The property owner or applicant for a permit to develop any parcel of land may apply to the council for a variance from the provisions of this chapter. The council may grant a variance only if it finds that practical difficulties or extenuating circumstances exist, that strict application of the chapter would impose an unreasonable burden on the property owner or permittee, and that granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations upon other properties in the vicinity. 
(Ord. 413 § 6, 1980).  
15.18.060 - Grant programSpecial circumstances area, findings. 
The council finds and determines that special circumstances exist with regard to developed properties located within the boundaries of the area shown in Exhibit B, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, which generally can be described as properties abutting Rocklin Road between Interstate 80 and First Street and properties abutting Pacific Street between the Roseville City boundary and Sierra Meadows Road. These special circumstances are: 
A.  These streets are main arterials of the city and crucial to the circulation of traffic within the entire city; 
B.  The width of these streets is greater than the width of other streets because they are main arterials; 
C.  The depth of the pavement required on these streets is greater than on other streets because they are main arterials; 
D.  The expense of installing frontage improvements along these streets is necessarily greater than along other streets because they are main arterials; and 
E.  This added expense of installing frontage improvements has impeded commercial growth and needed improvements to existing structures on these streets. 
(Ord. 413 § 7(A), 1980).  
15.18.070 - Grant programNecessity findings. 
The council hereby finds and determines that it is necessary to establish a grant program to encourage and assist owners of existing buildings in making the improvements required by Section 15.18.020 for the following reasons: 
A.  To encourage and make possible the improvement of existing buildings in an area where the street improvements required by Section 15.18.020 are unusually expensive for the reasons stated in Section 15.18.060; 
B.  To encourage the expansion, redevelopment and modernization of existing buildings located in the area shown in Exhibit B, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, in order to maintain and improve the economic vitality of such area and the city; 
C.  To prevent the commencement of blight, disuse and inefficient use of existing buildings and the resulting cost to the city. 
(Ord. 413 § 7(B), 1980).  
15.18.080 - Grant programAmountApplication deadline. 
Any person who proposes development to modify, alter or expand a structure which exists on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and which is within the area described in Exhibit B, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, may apply to the city for a grant in order to pay a portion, but not more than fifty percent, of the cost of installing the improvements required by Section 15.18.020. The proposed development must conform to the city's general plan, Title 17 and all other applicable ordinances. Each application must be submitted by January 1st to be considered for a grant during the following fiscal year. 
(Ord. 413 § 7(C), 1980).

Each year after receipt of applications made pursuant to Section 15.18.080, the city engineer shall establish a priority list by ranking each proposed project according to the following criteria: 
A.  The amount of traffic on the street to be improved; 
B.  The amount of traffic to be generated by the proposed project; 
C.  The physical condition of the street to be improved; 
D.  Increase in safety to pedestrians and vehicular traffic; 
E.  The likelihood that contiguous portions of the same street will be improved with resulting savings, if larger segments of the street are improved at the same time. 
(Ord. 413 § 7(D), 1980).  
15.18.100 - Grant programFunding. 
A.  The council shall establish a street improvement grant fund in the city's budget and each year shall allocate moneys, when available, to such fund. 
B.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to compel the council to allocate moneys to the street improvement grant fund or approve a grant of moneys to applicants during a particular fiscal year. 
(Ord. 413 § 7(E, M), 1980).  
15.18.110 - Grant programAwardsFunds carryover. 
A.  As soon as possible after adoption of the budget, the city engineer shall present to the council a proposed priority list together with a proposed grant amount to be received by each applicant. 
B.  The council shall approve or revise and approve a priority list and award of grant moneys. 
C.  Upon approval of the grants, each applicant who has been awarded a grant may enter into an agreement pursuant to which, in return for completing the improvements required pursuant to Section 15.18.020, the city will credit to the applicant the amount awarded in the grant. Such agreement shall require that the improvements be completed within one year of approval of the grant. 
D.  After inspection and certification by the city engineer that the improvements required by Section 15.18.020 have been completed in accord with the city's standards, the city shall credit to the applicant the amount of the grant. 
E.  In lieu of paying money to the applicant for the amount of the grant, the city may direct improvements to be made, the value of which is equivalent to the amount of the grant. 
F.  If at the end of the fiscal year moneys remain in the street improvement grant fund, either because they have not been approved for a grant or because the applicant has not installed the improvements and qualified for credit, the moneys shall be available for grants for the next fiscal year. 
G.  The grant program established pursuant to Sections 15.18.060 through this section shall terminate when the council determines, after a report from the city engineer, that financial assistance to properties to install street improvements is no longer necessary. 
(Ord. 413 § 7(FL), 1980).  
15.18.120 - Double frontage. 
Where a parcel abuts more than one public street, frontage improvements shall be required for the frontage of the parcel on each public street, subject to the provisions of Section 15.18.020. 
(Ord. 413 § 8, 1980).  
15.18.130 - Excepted subdivisionsRestoration or replacement exception. 
A.  This chapter shall be inapplicable to parcels in those subdivisions commonly known as Rustic Hills, Bridle Trails Estate, Secret Ravine Ranch Estates and Sunset Village Oaks and shall also be inapplicable in any subdivision hereafter created when it is determined, pursuant to Title 16, that the improvements required by this chapter are not necessary or desirable within such subdivision. 
B.  This chapter shall be inapplicable when the permit is for the restoration or replacement of a structure which has been partially or totally destroyed by an act of God, including, but not limited to, floods, earthquakes and lightning, or which has been found by the city to be a public nuisance.

15.28.230 - Erosion and sediment control. 
A.  The faces of cut and fill slopes shall be prepared and maintained to control against erosion. The protection for the slopes shall be installed as soon as practicable and prior to calling for final approval. Where the city engineer determines, based upon engineering information produced by the applicant, that cut slopes are not subject to erosion due to erosion-resistant character of the materials, such protection may be omitted. 
B.  An erosion and sediment control plan shall be required with any grading approval and shall include the following items: 
1.  Protective measures to be taken during construction such as hydromulching, berms (temporary or permanent), interceptor ditches, subsurface drains, terraces and/or sediment traps in order to prevent erosion by surface water or groundwater of the cut faces of excavations or of the sloping surfaces of fills; 
2.  Permanent methods of revegetation following completion of proposed grading or improvements; 
3.  Approximate sequence and timing of grading and construction increments and/or subsequent revegetation and/or landscaping work. 
C.  Revegetation Standards. 
1.  Permanent revegetation or landscaping, if required, is to be commenced on the construction site as soon as practical and in no case exceeding twelve months after achieving final grades and utility placements. Whenever practical, land is to be developed in increments of workable size which can be completed during a single construction season; erosion control measures are to be coordinated with the sequence of grading or improvements. 
2.  Grading equipment is to be confined to the area immediately adjacent to areas of disturbance as indicated by the approved plan. 
3.  All surfaces disturbed by vegetation removal, grading, haul roads, or other activity of construction which alters the natural vegetative cover are to be prepared for expedient revegetation or otherwise maintained to control erosion unless covered with impervious or other improved surfaces pursuant to approved plans within fourteen days following the completion of grading, or removal of vegetation if no grading was involved. 
4.  Topsoil removed from the surface in preparation for grading and construction is to be stored away from drainage structures and, whenever possible, away from inhabited residential areas and on or near the site, protected from erosion while grading operations are underway; provided, that such storage may not be located where it would cause suffocation of root systems of trees intended to be preserved. After completion of such grading, topsoil shall be restored to expose cut and fill embankments or building pads so as to provide a suitable base for seeding and planting. 
5.  Acceptable methods of revegetation include straw-mulching, hydro-mulching or planting of mixture specified in the Improvement Standards. Other methods of revegetation may be approved by the city engineer where equivalent protection is provided. 
6.  All revegetation and landscaping are to be conducted within suitable growing periods. Native plant materials are specifically encouraged in order to reduce irrigation demands. 
7.  Temporary sedimentation control facilities are to be installed in conjunction with initial grading operations and maintained throughout the construction period to remove sediments from runoff waters during development. 
8.  Permanent sediment catchment basins or other types of sediment retention facilities are required wherever necessary to prevent discharge of sediment into waters of the state. Sediment retention facilities shall be inspected and cleaned according to a regular maintenance schedule. 
9.  The planting or seeding of vegetative protection must be effective. If the vegetation does not grow and offer proper protection, it must be replanted or reseeded. 
10.  The maintenance of vegetative protection on graded slopes shall be the responsibility of the permittee and shall be guaranteed until the vegetation is well established or is officially assumed by another party approved by the public works director.

Chapter 16.18 - VESTING TENTATIVE MAP 
Sections: 
 
16.18.010 - Authority. 
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Sect. 66498.1) of Division 2, Title 7 of the California Government Code (the "Vesting Tentative Map Statute"). 
(Ord. 603 § 3 (part), 1989).  
16.18.020 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this title. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this chapter, the provisions of this title shall apply to vesting tentative maps. 
B.  The regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. 
(Ord. 603 § 3 (part), 1989).  
16.18.030 - Consistency. 
Any land subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map shall be consistent with the Rocklin General Plan, any applicable specific plan and Title 17 (zoning code) and any other applicable provisions of this code. 
(Ord. 603 § 3 (part), 1989).  
16.18.040 - Concurrent application. 
If a subdivider files an application for a vesting tentative map, seeking the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, concurrent applications for all other discretionary entitlements including rezoning, specific plan use permit and design review must be filed. 
(Ord. 603 § 3 (part), 1989).  
16.18.050 - Application. 
A.  This chapter shall apply to residential, commercial and industrial developments. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by this title, requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
B.  Making application for a vested tentative map shall be in the sole discretion of the subdivider. 
(Ord. 603 § 3 (part), 1989).  
16.18.060 - Filing. 
A vesting tentative map shall contain, or be accompanied by, the following information, in addition to all other filing requirements applicable to tentative maps contained in this title: 
A.  At the time a vesting tentative map is filed it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map"; 
B.  A vesting tentative map shall be accompanied by the following information in a form satisfactory to the community development director and city engineer: 
1.  Pertinent submittal materials to make concurrent application(s) for any other required discretionary entitlements in accordance with Section 16.18.050, 
2.  Detailed drawings, including a site plan, building elevations and landscape plan for the development of the land proposed for subdivision. This requirement may be waived by the community development director for single- family residential subdivisions that do not have planned development zoning classifications, 
3.  Sewer, water, storm drain and road details, 
4.  Information on the uses to which the buildings will be put, 
5.  Detailed Grading Plans. When the grading plan is revised after the vesting tentative map and preliminary grading plan have been considered and approved at a public hearing, the revised plan shall be filed with the director and shall be subject to the same hearing process and findings requirements as the original application, except that the subsequent hearings and decision shall be limited to the revised grading plan and the effects of the revisions on the design and improvement requirements of the tentative map, 
6.  Geological studies, 
7.  Flood control information, 
8.  Any other studies requested by the community development director and city engineer.

C.  Notwithstanding Section 16.20.060, the time for filing a parcel or final map for a vesting tentative map shall not be extended. Failure to file a parcel or final map within the time period established by Section 16.20.050 shall terminate all proceedings and no final map or parcel map for all or any part of the property included within the vesting tentative map shall be filed without first processing a new map pursuant to this chapter. 
D.  A vesting tentative map shall not be approved or conditionally approved unless, in addition to all other required findings, the council finds on the basis of the studies and reports submitted by the subdivider that all public facilities necessary to serve the subdivision or mitigate any impacts created by the subdivision will be available for the entire time that the vesting tentative map is valid plus any time during which the rights conferred by Section 16.18.080 exist. 
(Ord. 603 § 3 (part), 1989).  
16.18.080 - Rights conferred. 
A.  Approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the city's ordinances, policies and standards used to determine whether to approve or disapprove an application for a tentative map in effect at the time the application for the vesting tentative map is deemed complete. A determination of whether a development substantially complies with the approved or conditionally approved map, or with the ordinances, policies or standards described in this subsection, may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 17.86. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a subsequent permit or entitlement for development, unless it is an approved vesting tentative map, may be conditioned or denied if it is determined that: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the users of the subdivision or those persons in the immediate vicinity in a condition dangerous to their health or safety; 
2.  The condition or denial is required to comply with state or federal law. 
(Ord. 603 § 3 (part), 1989).

1.  A final map or parcel map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map; 
2.  The applicant has requested and the city has approved a change in the type, density, bulk or design of the development, unless an amendment to the vesting tentative map has been approved. 
B.  Upon the filing of a final map or parcel map for a vesting tentative map the rights conferred by Section 16.18.080 shall continue for one year. Where several final maps or parcel maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map this period shall begin for each phase when the final map or parcel map for that phase is recorded. 
C.  The time period set forth in subsection B of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit if such processing exceeds thirty days from the date a complete application is accepted. 
D.  A subdivider may apply to the council for a one-year extension of the rights conferred by subsection B of this section any time before the initial one-year time period expires. An extension may be granted if the council finds that the map still complies with the requirements of this title. The council may approve, conditionally approve or deny an extension in its sole discretion. 
E.  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time set forth in subsections B through D of this section, the rights shall continue until the expiration of the building permit and any extensions of the building permit. 
F.  Upon the expiration of the time limits specified in subsections B, C, D and E, all rights conferred by this section shall cease and the project shall be considered as the same as any subdivision which was not processed pursuant to this chapter.

Chapter 17.07 - GREENBRAE ISLAND ANNEXATION AREA OVERLAY ZONE 
 
17.07.010 - Greenbrae Island Annexation Area overlay zone established. 
A.  This chapter establishes the Greenbrae Island Annexation Area overlay zone (the "Annexation Area overlay zone"). The creation of this overlay zone is intended to smoothly transition the developed properties that have been annexed into the city and are now subject to the city of Rocklin Municipal Code and Zoning Code, from their prior status under Placer County regulations and zoning. This approach is consistent with the city's general plan policy of flexibility and innovation in development and planning techniques. 
B.  Use of property as it existed on the date of annexation into the city within the overlay zone is subject to the regulations of Title 17 as modified by this chapter. Development of previously undeveloped property within the overlay zone is subject to all requirements of the Rocklin Municipal Code including Title 17, the city of Rocklin Zoning Code. 
C.  The properties included within the Annexation Area overlay zone shall be indicated on the official zoning maps of the city by distinct shading over the affected properties. The affected properties are all properties either partially or fully developed on the date approved by Placer LAFCo for annexation into the city, within the area known as the county island area accessed primarily by Aguilar Road, Greenbrae Road, and Foothill Road. 
(Ord. No. 1045, § 2(Exh. A), 9-8-2015)  
17.07.020 - Development standards for existing developed properties. 
A.  All existing developed parcels conforming to the development standards required by the county zoning at the time of construction of the structures shall be deemed to be conforming in the Annexation Area overlay zone. 
B.  For any major reconstruction involving a new foundation, and if it is determined by the chief building official to be feasible to conform the new structure to the underlying city development standards, then the location of the reconstructed structure must conform to the underlying city development standards. 
C.  After the date of annexation approval by the Placer LAFCo, all new development requiring a city building permit must conform to the underlying city development standards. 
(Ord. No. 1045, § 2(Exh. A), 9-8-2015)  
17.07.030 - Horses and other similar large quadrupeds, sheep and goats conditionally permitted. 
A.  Horses, other similar large quadrupeds, sheep and goats are permitted in the Annexation Area overlay zone where there is sufficient space to accommodate them subject to the provisions of this section. The term immature offspring used in this section refers to animals that have not yet been weaned and/or are a maximum of one year in age. 
B.  Horses and other similar large quadrupeds are permitted in the following numbers: 
1.  One horse or similar large quadruped where the lot is not less than thirty thousand square feet, and two horses or similar large quadrupeds where the lot area is one acre net or greater. Up to a total of two immature offspring may also be allowed. 
2.  Three horses or similar large quadrupeds and up to a total of two immature offspring where the lot area is two acres net or greater. 
3.  Additional horses or other similar large quadrupeds may be kept on lots in excess of two acres net, in a number to be determined by the director of economic and community development. An administrative special use permit is required for the keeping of additional horses or similar large quadrupeds. 
C.  Sheep and goats are permitted in the following numbers: 
1.  Four mature animals and their immature offspring (not to exceed twelve animals in total) where the lot is not less than thirty thousand square feet, and six mature animals and their immature offspring (not to exceed fifteen animals in total) where the lot area is one acre net or greater. 
2.  Additional animals may be kept, in a number to be determined by the director of economic and community development. An administrative special use permit is required for the keeping of additional animals. 
D.  The number of animals identified as allowed per lot area in subsections A, B and C is not intended to imply that horses or other large quadrupeds as well as sheep and/or goats will be allowed collectively on a single lot in those numbers. The keeping of horses and any other similar large quadrupeds, as well as, sheep and goats on a single lot may only be permitted on sites greater than one acre in size and only with prior approval of a use permit from the economic and community development director. 
E.  Horses, other large quadrupeds, sheep and goats permitted under this section must comply with the provisions of Rocklin Municipal Code Chapter 6.36 regarding livestock. 
F.  Because the potential incompatible impacts of additional animals are a localized impact, a property owner must apply for and obtain an administrative special use permit approved by the director of economic and community development, after payment of a fee and review of the permit which cost and process are substantially equivalent to the administrative special event permit authorized by Rocklin Municipal Code Chapter 17.63.

B.  For all existing developed parcels which can demonstrate physical site constraints making compliance with Rocklin Municipal Code Section 17.08.130(D)(1) infeasible, then parking of the accessory vehicle shall be allowed in the front yard or street side yard setback area, provided the accessory vehicle is parked as far from the street as feasibly possible based on site conditions. Feasibility shall be determined by the economic and community development director.

1.  In residential zones, temporary parking of a single accessory vehicle shall be permitted in the front yard or street side yard setback for a period not to exceed forty-eight consecutive hours for the purposes of loading, unloading, cleaning and general maintenance. It is the intent of this subsection that the provisions for loading and unloading, cleaning and general maintenance be granted solely for accessory vehicles owned or rented by the residents of the property on which the accessory vehicle is being parked. For the purposes of this section, a vehicle shall be considered to have been parked or left standing for forty-eight or more consecutive hours if it has remained inoperable or has not been moved at least one-half mile during the forty-eight-hour period. An inoperable vehicle is a vehicle that cannot be moved under its own power or a vehicle which cannot operate legally and safely on the highways of the state. If visible, the mileage reflected on the odometer of the vehicle shall be rebuttably presumed to be an accurate indication of the distance that the vehicle has or has not been moved. Obstruction of the odometer of the vehicle will result in a presumption that the vehicle has not been moved. Absent any presumption, the totality of the circumstances, including but not limited to tire markings, vegetation and vehicle condition, shall be considered in determining whether the vehicle has or has not been moved. 
2.  Mobile or portable structures for city, county, state, and federal government use are permitted in all zones.

1.  On private property in the frontyard setback including the driveway; 
2.  The street sideyard setback; 
3.  On public rights-of-way, within one thousand feet of the property line where the person who owns or has possession, custody or control of the accessory vehicle resides. 
G.  An accessory vehicle observed to be parked for a period of nine days within any thirty-day period, in the frontyard setback, street sideyard setback, or on the public street within one thousand feet of the property line where the person who owns or has possession, custody or control of the accessory vehicle resides, shall be prima facie evidence of a stored accessory vehicle in violation of this section. Presentation to the enforcement official of a contract with a bona fide commercial storage yard specifically identifying the accessory vehicle in question and clearly stating the monthly storage charge and business contact information shall, upon verification by the enforcement official, be prima facie evidence that the vehicle is not being stored in violation of this section. 
H.  Violation of this section is deemed to be an infraction and is punishable as such pursuant to Chapter 1.14 of this code, or at the discretion of the enforcement official or city attorney, may be punishable by the use of any other civil or administrative remedy or penalty authorized by, or set forth in, the Rocklin Municipal Code.

Chapter 17.57 - AUTOMOTIVE OVERLAY ZONE 
 
17.57.010 - Automotive Overlay zone. 
This chapter establishes the Automotive Overlay zone. The creation of this overlay zone provides a mechanism for a person to propose an automotive related development (including autos, boats, RVs, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and other vehicles) that is beneficial to the community and implements the city's general plan policy of flexibility and innovation in development and planning techniques. Development of property within the overlay zone is subject to the regulations of Title 17 as modified by this chapter. The properties included within the Automotive Overlay zone shall be indicated on the approved zoning map depicting the Automotive Overlay zone area. 
(Ord. No. 1023, § 2(Exh. A), 1-27-2015)  
17.57.020 - Purpose and intent. 
This Automotive Overlay zone is an opportunity to utilize an alternative zoning tool for those properties that are within the boundaries of the Automotive Overlay zone. The property owner shall have the choice of developing property pursuant to the provisions of the underlying zone, or developing property pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. It is the intent of the city council to create an Automotive Overlay zone that will provide for the following: 
A.  Implement a streamlined entitlement review and approval process, and eliminate the need for a conditional use permit for outdoor display for automotive related uses within the Automotive Overlay zone area; 
B.  Allow for greater flexibility in the application of the city's approved design guidelines and development standards within the overlay zone in a manner grounded in market realities and working with corporate requirements of automotive brands; 
C.  Encourage new automotive related uses and the expansion or reinvestment of existing automotive uses within the Automotive Overlay zone area making the regulatory process easier for the owners and tenants to negotiate; 
D.  Create a vibrant commercial destination that attracts shoppers locally and from throughout the region, and provides local jobs; 
E.  Allow for flexibility of design, and development of outcome-based design goals rather than specific design standards. The design goals should consider the unique characteristics of automotive uses while emphasizing quality design and development. 
F.  Creation of the Automotive Overlay zone will establish this area of Rocklin as a desirable location for automotive uses and provide a tool by which the city can attract additional automotive uses and encourage partnerships of existing automotive related businesses. This partnership will in turn provide a mechanism for automotive related businesses to market to potential customers. 
(Ord. No. 1023, § 2(Exh. A), 1-27-2015)

Chapter 17.59 - BUSINESS ATTRACTION, RETENTION, AND REVITALIZATION OVERLAY ZONE 
 
17.59.010 - Business Attraction, Retention, and Revitalization Overlay zone. 
This chapter establishes the Business Attraction, Retention, and Revitalization Overlay zone (the "BARRO zone"). The creation of this overlay zone provides a mechanism for a person to propose a commercial, residential or residentialnonresidentialmixed-use development that is beneficial to the community and implements the city's general plan policy of flexibility and innovation in development and planning techniques. Development of property within the overlay zone is subject to the regulations of Title 17 as modified by this chapter. The properties included within the Business Attraction, Retention, and Revitalization Overlay zone shall be indicated on the official zoning maps of the city by distinct shading over the affected properties. 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
17.59.020 - Findings. 
In approving this chapter, the city council of the city of Rocklin finds and determines that: 
A.  The continued vitality of older commercial areas is essential to the economic well-being of the city and to the needs of citizens. 
B.  Fees, project entitlement processes, and development standards created primarily for the development of raw land have the unintended consequence of discouraging the improvement and renovation of older developments; especially those that consist of a single building, a small commercial cluster, and/or undersized and underutilized lots. 
C.  Many of the properties located within the Business Attraction, Retention, and Revitalization Overlay zone are characterized by structures that are sixty to one hundred plus years old, small lots, and/or outdated development patterns. As a result the strict application of the development standards found in this title effectively act to discourage the use, redevelopment, and enhancement of individual properties and clusters of properties within the BARRO zone area. 
D.  Providing a process for revitalization of older commercial areas focused on flexible development standards, streamlined approval processes, and reduced application fees, will benefit the city by improving their appearance and economic vitality, providing opportunities for pedestrian friendly amenities, and when appropriate, allowing for small scale residential development. 
E.  The BARRO zone district currently contains a mix of residential and commercial structures and uses. The creation and implementation of the BARRO zone creates a bridge tool for development in the BARRO zone district. The city council finds that inclusion of both commercial and residential uses in the BARRO zone is consistent with and implements the Rocklin General Plan including the following land use goals and policies: 
1.  Goal for Commercial Land Use: To retain and renew existing commercial land uses and designate sufficient new commercial areas to meet future city needs. 
2.  Policies for Commercial Land Use: 
a.  To promote and renew as needed, the Pacific Street, Rocklin Road, Sunset Boulevard, and Granite Drive business districts in order to provide diversified business opportunities. 
b.  To approve designation of sufficient commercial land to meet the future needs of the city. 
c.  To ensure that adequate parking and access are included in approved commercial development plans. 
d.  To avoid "strip commercial" land uses in newly developing areas by encouraging the "village concept" of grouping commercial land use in village core areas. 
e.  To minimize conflicts between new commercial land uses and other land uses, especially residential, park, and recreational uses. 
To promote flexibility and innovation in commercial land use through the use of planned unit developments, developer agreements, specific plans and other innovative development and planning techniques. 
f.  To maintain development standards and develop new standards, including off-site parking provisions, unique to the central commercial area of Rocklin along Pacific Street from Midas to Farron Streets. 
g.  To encourage use of the Rocklin Downtown Revitalization Plan and Design Guidelines when considering projects in the area generally abutting Rocklin Road and Pacific Street from Midas Avenue to Farron Street. 
3.  Goal for Residential Land Use: To designate, protect, and provide land to ensure sufficient residential development to meet community needs. 
4.  Policies for Existing Residential Land Use: 
a.  To protect existing residential areas from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. 
b.  To preserve and enhance the quality of existing residential areas by continuing to provide high-quality public services, by rehabilitating useful structures and by removing substandard units. 
c.  To continue programs for the prevention of blight, considering all public and private resources available, including: enforcement of all codes, neighborhood rehabilitation programs, and redevelopment agency actions. 
d.  To encourage active involvement by individuals and citizen organizations in maintaining and upgrading existing residential neighborhoods. 
e.  To encourage preservation and adaptive reuse of significant historic structures and sites. 
f.  To require that new development in or near existing residential areas be compatible with those existing neighborhoods. 
g.  To promote flexibility and innovation in residential land use through the use of planned unit developments, developer agreements, specific plans, mixed use projects, and other innovative development and planning techniques. 
h.  To maintain development standards unique to Old Town Rocklin that encourage residential development on small lots. 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
17.59.030 - Purpose and intent. 
This Business Attraction, Retention, and Revitalization Overlay zone concept is an opportunity to utilize an alternative zoning tool for those properties that are within the boundaries of the BARRO zone. The property owner shall have the choice of developing property pursuant to the provisions of the underlying zone, or developing property pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. It is the intent of the city council to create an overlay zone district in Title 17, Zoning of the Rocklin Municipal Code that will provide for the following: 
A.  Implement a streamlined entitlement review and approval process, and a reduced fee structure, for in-fill development projects within the BARRO zone area; 
B.  Allow for reduced infrastructure development standards and greater flexibility in the application of the city's approved design guidelines and development standards within the overlay zone in a manner grounded in market realities; 
C.  Improve the appearance and economic vitality of small and/or older commercial structures and developments and thereby contribute to the overall improvement of older commercial areas by making the regulatory process easier for the owners and tenants to negotiate; 
D.  Create a vibrant commercial destination with an active street life that would attract travelers and commuters who use Pacific Street as a regional transportation corridor, and where local residents have services, shops, and jobs; 
E.  Protect, preserve and maintain the integrity of the existing single-family residential neighborhoods immediately adjacent to the BARRO zone area through innovative and thoughtful design techniques; 
F.  Allow for the use of varying architectural design themes, but require that each design is thoughtfully blended and is compatible with adjoining and adjacent development; 
G.  Maintain land use and development options so as individual properties become available for development, there are choices between commercial, residential or mixed use projects which are appropriate for current market conditions; 
H.  Encourage compatibility between residential and commercial uses in areas where residential zones directly abut commercial zones, by permitting greater design flexibility across the existing boundaries of the two zones; and 
I.  Encourage within the BARRO zone the inclusion of a public open space amenity, or some form of physical interface for the pedestrian. Such features may include: 
1.  Formal Plazas. A formal plaza would be a publicly accessible open space which has a design that is influenced by classical urban planning design. A formal plaza would typically include some sort of central water fountain and/or symmetrical landscaping. 
2.  Urban Gardens. An urban garden can be located on the ground level, or on upper levels of a structure. Urban gardens include ornamental landscaping arranged in raised or at-grade planters or planting areas, potted plants and trees. Many times there are sculptures or other forms of public art that are included within the urban garden. 
3.  Covered Colonnades. Colonnades are linear in design and generous in depth. The intent is to provide a comfortably wide, covered pathway that is adjacent to the openings of a building. Sometimes the second floor of a building is utilized to create the "covered" element of the colonnade. 
4.  Sidewalk Dining. Sidewalk dining may occur wherever a sidewalk space is ample enough to accommodate dining furniture without impeding pedestrian access of the sidewalk. Sidewalk dining may be defined with a railing or planters, or be open and accessible. 
5.  Pedestrian Alleys and Walkways. A pedestrian alley or walkway is typically a "lane" that does not follow the alignment of a vehicular street, but provides a pedestrian access to either a public space or some other feature within the interior of a development. Pedestrian alleys or walkways must be designed in such a manner so as to be inviting to pedestrians. Therefore, issues such as lighting, security, line of sight, cleanliness and visual appeal are important considerations to a well designed pedestrian alley or walkway. Sometimes public art, street furniture and access to shops and public spaces are features of pedestrian alleys and walkways. 
J.  Ensure that the appearance and effects of buildings and uses are harmonious with the character of the area in which they are located.

17.59.040 - Applicability; conflicts. 
A.  The provisions of this Chapter 17.59 shall apply to those areas indicted on the zoning map of the city of Rocklin by distinct shading or other identification, and in a manner consistent with the identification of boundaries for other zones set forth in Title 17, shown on the zoning map of the city of Rocklin, and prior decisions of the city regarding the actual boundaries of properties within city land use zones. 
B.  Conflict. Should a provision of this Chapter 17.59 conflict with any other provision of Title 17 of the Rocklin Municipal Code, or any other city resolutions, ordinances, or regulations of the city, this chapter shall control. 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
17.59.050 - Authority for approvals; determination; fees. 
A.

B.  Notwithstanding Section 17.70.020, the city council designates the community development director as the approving authority for conditional use permits issued in conformance with this chapter for projects within those areas affected by the Business Attraction, Retention, and Revitalization Overlay zone. 
C.  The community development director shall review the application for its compliance with the citywide design review guidelines and the Rocklin Downtown Revitalization Plan and Design Guidelines and the conformity of the proposed project with the surrounding properties. The community development director shall have the authority to, and shall take action to grant, grant with conditions, or deny the application based on the information contained in the application and any information obtained from the staff review of the project. 
D.  Notwithstanding other provisions for fees adopted by city ordinance or resolution, the fees applicable to review and approval of entitlements issued in conformance with this chapter for projects within the BARRO zone shall be determined on the fully loaded hourly rate for city staff utilized to review and approve the project development entitlements, up to a maximum fee as follows: 
1.  Design review approvals       $3,500.00 
2.  Conditional use permits       $2,000.00 
3.  Environmental review       $3,000.00 
E.  The community development director shall prescribe the forms and documents to be filed for a permit under the provisions of the BARRO zone. 
F.  When a project subject to design review also requires a discretionary permit, or modification thereof, under Chapter 17.70, the design review application shall be made, processed and heard simultaneously with the other discretionary permit, unless this requirement is waived by the community development director. 
G.  The community development director may act on the application without a formally noticed public hearing. Notice of a pending application pursuant to the BARRO zone regulations shall be posted on the proposed project site and on the city of Rocklin website. Such notice shall specify that any interested person may view the application materials at the city of Rocklin offices during business hours; the ten-day time period when the public may submit written comments on the proposed project to the city; the date whereon the community development director is expected to take action on the proposed project; and the date by which anyone may appeal of the final action of the community development director in the manner provided by Chapter 17.86 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
17.59.060 - Special standards. 
To encourage economic development, reinvestment, and enhancement of the properties within the boundaries of the district the following special standards shall apply: 
A.  Nonconforming Standards. Properties located within the Business Attraction, Retention, and Revitalization Overlay zone shall be exempted from the following specific provisions of Title 17, Chapter 17.62, Nonconforming Uses and Structures of the Rocklin Municipal Code: 
17.08.080Commerce or Industry Abutting Residential zone. 
17.62.050Off-street parking deficiency. 
17.62.080Nonconforming useConforming structure. 
17.62.090Conforming useNonconforming buildingRepair and maintenance. 
17.62.100Conforming useNonconforming buildingEnlargements. 
17.62.120Conforming useNonconforming buildingRestoration. 
17.62.130Nonconforming use and buildingTermination of use. 
17.62.140Nonconforming use and buildingAdditions, enlargements, repairs. 
17.75.070.C.2.Permit requirements and procedures (signs). 
B.  Design Guidelines. The community development director is hereby authorized to exercise wide latitude and significant discretion in determining if, when, and how to apply specific provisions of the Rocklin Downtown Revitalization Plan and Design Guidelines and Design Review Guidelines (Feb. 2008, as amended) applicable to a particular project site based upon the unique characteristics of the project site and the immediately surrounding properties in order to achieve the best possible project consistent with the over all goal of promoting the development of economically viable, cohesive, and attractive neighborhoods. 
C.  Parking. Parking is typically one of the most challenging development standards to meet when attempting to develop older in-fill sites. By its very nature, parking requires a significant dedication of land which cannot be translated into leasable sales area or saleable square footage. However, adequate and easily accessible parking is critical to the long term success and viability of any development. 
1.  Parking requirements shall be determined on a project specific basis by the community development director after consideration of the on-site parking standards listed in the Rocklin Zoning Code for the type of development proposed, the physical constraints of the property in question, the availability of nearby on-street parking and public parking facilities, and other potential mitigating factors. 
2.  The Old Town area has a series of public parking lots that can be used to assume some or all of the required off-street parking for new development within the BARRO zone district. 
3.  Residential uses will be required to provide on-site parking for each residential unit; however, the guest parking requirements may be a candidate for transfer to nearby public parking lots. Commercial uses may propose to transfer up to their entire on-site parking obligation to public parking lots, however, they will be encouraged to maintain handicapped accessible parking on their property, as well as loading areas. 
D.  Performance Standards for Neighborhood Compatibility. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that uses in the BARRO zone are not adversely impacted by the adjacent uses, both on-site and off-site, including, but not limited to traffic, noise, and safety impacts. In the interests of both the residents and the businesses, no project entitlement shall be approved for a project combining residential and commercial uses on the same site, unless the project is designed to meet the following performance standards, in addition to all other applicable regulations of this chapter. 
1.  Noise. 
a.  Residential units shall be constructed so that interior noise levels do not exceed an Ldn of 45 dB(A) in any habitable room. 
b.  Commercial uses shall be designed and operated, and hours of operation limited where appropriate, so that neighboring residents are not exposed to offensive noise, especially from traffic or late-night activity. 
c.  Common walls between residential and nonresidential uses shall be constructed to minimize the transmission of noise and vibration. 
2.  Security. 
a.  The residential units shall be designed with specific consideration towards the security of residents, including, but not limited to, the provision of separate and secured entrances. 
b.  Nonresidential and residential uses located on the same floor of the same building shall not have common entrance hallways or common balconies. 
c.  Parking spaces for nonresidential and residential uses shall be specifically designated by posting, pavement marking, and/or physical separation. 
3.  Lighting. 
a.  All outdoor lighting associated with commercial uses shall be designed so as not to substantially and adversely impact surrounding residential uses, while also providing a sufficient level of illumination for access and security purposes. Such lighting shall not blink, flash, occilate, or be of unusually high intensity of brightness. 
b.  Parking areas shall be illuminated so as to provide appropriate visibility and security during hours of darkness. 
4.  Odors, Dust, Vibration. No commercial use shall be designed or operated so as to expose residents to offensive odors, dust, electrical interference, and/or vibration. 
5.  Refuse Storage and Location. The residential units shall maintain a separate refuse storage container from that used by the commercial uses. It shall be clearly marked for residential use only, and use by commercial uses is prohibited. 
6.  To the extent feasible, the five factors listed above shall be considered and incorporated into the design of all nonresidential projects abutting existing residential zones. Residential projects abutting existing nonresidential projects shall be designed to incorporate as many design features as necessary to mitigate for the five factors listed above. 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
17.59.070 - Limitations on approval authority. 
The administrative approval authority set forth in this chapter shall be limited to projects of a size and scope which are consistent with the standards for in-fill development set forth in the California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines CCR Section 15332In-Fill Development Projects and the further restrictions set forth in this section. Those standards are as follows: 
A.  The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and the general plan policies set forth in subsection 17.59.020E. above, as well as the zoning designation and regulations stated in this chapter. 
B.  The proposed development is on a project site of no more than three acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. 
C.  The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare, or threatened species. 
D.  Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, or water quality. 
E.  The site is adequately served by all required utilities and public services. 
F.  A project proposing additional story on buildings originally approved by the city council are ineligible for administrative review and approval under this chapter and shall be subject to design review as set forth in Chapter 17.72. 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
17.59.080 - Permitted uses. 
All permitted or conditionally permitted uses in the underlying zone are permitted uses unless the community development director determines that the proposed use warrants the application of operational conditions. In those cases where operational conditions of approval are necessary to make the proposed use compatible with the surrounding uses, a conditional use permit shall be required. In addition, to promote an active street life, enhance the vitality of businesses, and reduce vehicular traffic, residential structures and uses are permitted in the BARRO zone district. 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
17.59.090 - Appeal. 
Any person dissatisfied by an act or determination of the community development director relating to the approval or denial of a project application under this chapter, or the interpretation or enforcement of this chapter, may appeal such act or determination to the planning commission as provided in Chapter 17.86. 
(Ord. No. 986, § 2(Exh. B), 8-14-2012)  
Chapter 17.60 - PD ZONE 
Sections: 
 
17.60.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The planned development (PD) zone provides the means for greater creativity and flexibility in environmental design than is provided under the strict application of the zoning and subdivision ordinances, while at the same time protecting the public health, safety and welfare and property values. Various land uses may be combined in a planned development zone including combinations of residential, commercial, industrial, utility, institutional, educational, cultural, recreational and other uses, provided the combination of uses results in a balanced and stable environment. 
B.  The specific purposes of the planned development zone are to: 
1.  Promote and encourage cluster development on large sites to avoid sensitive areas of property; 
2.  Encourage creative and innovative design on large sites by allowing flexibility in property development standards; 
3.  Encourage the preservation of open space; 
4.  Accommodate various types of large scale, complex and phased developments; 
5.  Establish a procedure for the development of large tracts of land in order to reduce or eliminate the rigidity, delays, and conflicts that otherwise would result from application of zoning standards designed primarily for small lots.

(Ord. 832 § 1 (part), 2000).  
17.60.070 - Development in the PD zone. 
Upon the establishment of a PD zone, development within the zone may commence provided all other applicable regulations, including design review under Rocklin Municipal Code Chapter 17.72, have been satisfied. 
(Ord. 832 § 1 (part), 2000).  
17.60.080 - Preexisting PD zones. 
All development within PD zones or under general development plans which were adopted prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 832 shall require design review pursuant to Chapter 17.72 instead of approval of a specific plan use permit. 
(Ord. 832 § 1 (part), 2000).  
Chapter 17.61 - H-D ZONE 
Sections: 
 
17.61.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The H-D zone is established and is intended to enhance the value and distinctive character of the city of Rocklin's historic Front Street area that exists along First Street, between Rocklin Road and Farron Street. The area to which the H-D zone shall apply shall be known as the "Front Street historic district." 
The development of land within the Front Street historic district should be controlled so as to create an exciting and visible community, capitalizing on the area's proud heritage. To achieve this purpose, it is necessary to impose reasonable restrictions upon the use and erection of new buildings and structures and the alteration of existing and relocated buildings and structures. The revitalization of the Front Street historic district is in keeping with the objectives and proposals of the general plan for the city. 
(Ord. 480 § 1 (part), 1982: Ord. 336 § 14.01.000, 1977).

A.  It is the duty of the committee to administer and ensure compliance with the regulations and procedures contained within this chapter, in the manner prescribed herein. It is its responsibility to recommend to the planning commission any changes to regulations applicable to the district, provided such changes are necessary for the proper execution of the adopted plan, and to adopt rules of procedure to supplement those contained within this chapter. 
B.  The committee shall adopt, subject to the review and approval of the city council, architectural criteria and standards to be used in evaluating the appropriateness of any development for which a permit is applied under the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  The architectural criteria and standards shall insure that all applications for approval of exterior work are treated uniformly and fairly and promote consistency. Architectural criteria and standards shall be used to assure: 
1.  That rehabilitation work shall not destroy the distinguishing qualities or character of the structure and its environment. The removal or alteration of any historic material or architectural features should be held to a minimum; 
2.  That deteriorated architectural features are repaired rather than replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in the composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of original features, substantiated by physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural features from other buildings; 
3.  That distinctive, stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize historic structures and often predate the mass production of building materials be treated with sensitivity; 
4.  That changes which may have taken place in the course of time and which have acquired significance in their own right be recognized and respected; 
5.  That all structures be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged; 
6.  That contemporary design for additions to existing structures or landscaping shall not be discouraged if such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the neighborhood, structures, or its environment; 
7.  That wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures be done in such a manner that if they were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would be unimpaired; 
8.  That new construction not necessarily mimic historic structures, but assure that new construction be compatible with traditional buildings within the historic area; 
9.  That alterations or new construction of storefronts, windows, doors, cornices, roofs, masonry materials, colors, and signs be compatible with a uniform design and construction theme established for the Front Street historic district by the city. 
D.  The committee may approve, modify, or disapprove any application for a building permit for which review by the committee is required under Chapter 17.72, based upon compliance or noncompliance with the adopted regulations and approved architectural criteria and standards. 
E.  It shall not be the responsibility of the committee to prepare or adopt precise area or community plans.

Sections: 
 
17.62.010 - Intent. 
Within the zones established by this title or by amendments which may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land or any combination thereof which were lawful before the ordinance codified in this title was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this title. The council declares that nonconforming uses and structures are incompatible with permitted uses and structures in the zones involved and shall not be enlarged, expanded, or extended. Further, nonconforming uses and structures are intended to be eliminated as soon as practical. 
(Ord. 336 § 8.01.000, 1977).  
17.62.020 - Old nonconforming remain so.

(Ord. 336 § 8.01.010, 1977).  
17.62.030 - Conditional uses without permit. 
Any use existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, which is listed as a conditional use in the zone wherein located, and for which a conditional use permit has not been granted, shall be and remain a nonconforming use until a conditional use permit is obtained as provided in Chapter 17.70.

17.62.040 - Conditional use permit issuance.

The council shall require such conditions as to make the use as nearly conforming to the zone as possible. In addition thereto, the council shall make a finding in writing that the nonconforming use as conditioned will not be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the use, or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or of the general welfare of the city. In no instance can the council grant such a use permit unless the use is in conformity with the general plan.

17.62.110 - Conforming useNonconforming buildingRelocation.

Chapter 17.69 - RESTRICTIONS ON TOBACCO RETAILERS 
 
17.69.010 - Purpose and findings. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to discourage the use of tobacco products by children by limiting the potential adverse direct and secondary effects of a tobacco retailer operating in close proximity to schools. The adverse health effects of smoking and secondhand smoke are well documented by numerous public health agencies, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, the World Health Organization, and the Tobacco Related Disease Research Program. These same organizations have published studies on smoking by youth under the age of eighteen including these statistics: 
 Eighty-eight percent of adult daily smokers smoked their first cigarette before the age of eighteen. 
 Each day in the United States three thousand two hundred youth under eighteen smoke their first cigarette. 
 Each day in the United States seven hundred youth under eighteen become daily cigarette users. 
B.  Electronic/vapor inhalation of substances ("vaping"), with or without nicotine, is a rapidly growing trend, especially among youth pursuant to recent studies by public health agencies. Most local, state and federal laws only address traditional tobacco smoking. Although state law prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes to minors (California Health and Safety Code Section 119405), it does not prohibit minors from possessing or using e-cigarettes. Public health research is ongoing and there is growing concern and some evidence that this type of behavior is unhealthy. Additionally, the effects of secondhand vapor are not fully understood and are dependent on the chemical makeup of the substance being inhaled. 
(Ord. No. 1044, § 2, 9-8-2015)  
17.69.020 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall be ascribed the following meanings:

"Electronic smoking device" includes any component, part, or paraphernalia of such a product, including but not limited to cartridges, cartomizers, e-liquid, smoke juice, tips, atomizers, ESD batteries, and ESD chargers, whether or not it is sold separately. 
B.  "Smoking room" or "smoking lounge" means a room which is specifically provided and furnished for smoking, generally in buildings where smoking is otherwise prohibited. 
C.  "Tobacco product" means any product containing, made or derived from tobacco or contains nicotine from any source that is intended for human consumption, whether smoked, chewed, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other means. "Tobacco product" includes, but is not limited to cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco, snuff, snus, creamy snuff, dipping/chewing tobacco, flavored tobacco, tobacco water, tobacco paste, gutka, kretek, shisha, roll-your-own cigarettes, cigarette or cigar rolling papers, pipes, or electronic smoking devices. "Tobacco product" does not include any product that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for sale as a tobacco cessation product and is being marketed and sold solely for that approved purpose. 
D.  "Tobacco retailer" means any person, retail establishment, or any other legal entity who sells, distributes, or delivers to any person(s), for any form of consideration, tobacco products, including electronic smoking devices as defined in this section, and 1) tobacco products sales, distribution or delivery accounts for more than fifty percent of the business income, or 2) the business is advertised as a tobacco shop, smoke shop, or has a similar business identification relating to a tobacco retailer.

For purposes of this subsection, "designated" means a parcel that is general plan designated, zoned, or that has been conditionally permitted to conduct such use. The separation distances required by this chapter shall be measured from parcel line to parcel line. 
(Ord. No. 1044, § 2, 9-8-2015)  
17.69.040 - Preexisting nonconforming use. 
Existing tobacco retailers that were lawfully operating at the time of the effective date of this chapter which do not meet the locational requirements of Section 17.69.030 may continue as a legal nonconforming use until such time as the use is abandoned for a period of ninety continuous days, whether or not there was the intent to abandon such use. Such nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged, expanded, or extended. 
(Ord. No. 1044, § 2, 9-8-2015)  
17.69.050 - Ventilation. 
Any smoking room or smoking lounge shall provide ventilation and filtration in accordance with all requirements imposed by the Rocklin Building and Fire Safety Regulations, or as otherwise required by state or federal law, or as required to ensure the ventilated secondhand smoke is sufficiently neutralized at the property line of adjacent parcels so that a person of normal sensitivity would not detect the secondhand smoke.

B.  If the property for which the conditional use permit is granted has been assessed a park and recreation fee pursuant to Chapter 3.16, as amended, and this fee has been paid, the applicant shall be credited for the amount of the fee paid.

No credit shall be given for private open space planned for the use for which the conditional use permit is granted, except whenever any conditional use permit is granted for a residential use containing fifty or more units to be developed as an apartment project or stock cooperative for which no subdivision map is required, and private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in the proposed plans and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the use, partial credit, not to exceed fifty percent, may be given against the requirement of payment of fees if the planning commission upon the recommendation of the parks and recreation commission, finds that it is in the public interest to do so and all of the following standards are met: 
A.  Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and 
B.  The private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by recorded written instrument, conveyance or restrictions; and 
C.  The use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor; and 
D.  The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; and 
E.  The facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreational elements of the general plan. Before credit is given, the commission shall make written findings that the above standards are met. 
(Ord. 466 § 1 (part), 1982: Ord. 336 § 3.03.507, 1977). 
(Ord. No. 963, § 2, 7-27-2010)

The applicant shall pay the fee no later than six months after final city approval of the conditional use permit or prior to any application for a building permit, whichever occurs first unless the commission designates a later time for payment. 
In the event credit was established, the amount of the credit shall be reimbursed upon the determination of the planning director that the open space and related facilities that qualified the project for credit have been completed per the approved plans. 
(Ord. 466 § 1 (part), 1982: Ord. 336 § 3.03.508, 1977).  
17.71.100 - Refund. 
A.  If the applicant fails to commence the use for which the conditional use permit was issued and the applicant paid park fees pursuant to this chapter, the applicant may file for a refund of such fee upon the expiration and lapse of the conditional use permit. The application for refund shall be filed with the planning director. 
B.  Failure to claim such refund within one year of the expiration of the conditional use permit shall be a waiver of any right to such refund. 
C.  Upon satisfactory proof that the conditional use permit has not been exercised, and upon approval by the planning commission, the city shall refund any such park fee. 
D.  This section shall not apply to permits which have been exercised and have lapsed under the provisions of subsection B of Section 17.70.070.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1006, § 4(Exh. A), adopted Jan. 28, 2014, repealed the former Ch. 17.75, §§ 17.75.01017.75.110, and enacted a new Ch. 17.75 as set out herein. The former Ch. 17.75 pertained to sign regulations. See the Ordinance List and Disposition Table and the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for a complete derivation. 
 
17.75.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The city council finds as follows: 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to encourage signs which are integrated with, and harmonious to, the buildings and sites which they occupy, to eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays, to preserve and improve the appearance of the city as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade, and to restrict signs which increase the probability of accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision. 
B.  In adopting this chapter, the city council finds that excessive and inappropriate signage has an adverse impact on the overall visual appearance of a city, and can increase risks to traffic and pedestrians. Proper sign control will safeguard and preserve the health, property and public welfare of Rocklin residents through prohibiting, regulating and controlling the design, location and maintenance of signs. 
C.  The regulations established by this chapter are intended to appropriately limit the placement, type, size, and number of signs allowed within the city, and to require the proper maintenance of signs. By adopting this chapter the city intends to regulate signs on the basis of location, relationship to land uses, illumination, motion, size, height, orientation, separation, safety of physical structures, and the public need for functional information. 
D.  The purposes of these limitations and requirements are to: 
1.  Safeguard and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and advance the goals, policies, and strategies of the city of Rocklin General Plan and the city's companion strategic plan; 
2.  Reduce or avoid traffic and/or safety hazards to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians, caused by visual distractions and obstructions, or to impede their access; 
3.  Protect and enhance the character and setting of the city of Rocklin against visual blight by preventing a proliferation of signs that will detract from, and obscure, the scenic qualities of the city and its individual buildings and neighborhoods: 
4.  Promote the aesthetic and environmental values of the community by providing for signs that do not impair the attractiveness of the city as a place to live, work, and shop; 
5.  Provide for signs as an effective channel of communication, and as a means for members of the public to express themselves by displaying a sign, while ensuring that signs are aesthetically proportioned in relation to adjacent structures and the structures to which they are attached, and appropriate for the context of the neighborhoods where they are located; and 
6.  Preserve the quiet, low-traffic character of residential neighborhoods. 
E.  This chapter sets forth standards and minimum requirements to safeguard life, safety, property and public welfare by regulating the size, height, construction, location, electrification, operation and maintenance of all signs and sign structures exposed to public view within the city. The pleasing visual appearance and traffic safety of the city cannot be preserved and achieved by measures less restrictive than the procedures and standards of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 4(Exh. A), 1-28-2014)  
17.75.020 - Applicability; permit required. 
A.  General. This chapter shall apply to all property and land within the city of Rocklin. 
B.  Permit Requirement. A sign permit is required prior to the installation or display of any sign, except those exempt signs described herein. It is unlawful for any person, firm, organization, or corporation that owns, operates, controls, rents, or leases property or land in the city of Rocklin to construct, maintain, display or alter, or to cause or allow to be constructed, maintained, displayed, or altered, a sign within the city except in conformance with this chapter. In the case of after-the-fact permitting, the otherwise applicable fee shall be doubled. 
C.  Exempt Signs. The city has a compelling interest to exempt certain signs to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter and to allow for the use of signs with minimal aesthetic impact. The following signs, described in Table 1, may be installed without a sign permit; provided, that they meet the stated conditions, but may require a building permit or encroachment permit.

(Ord. No. 1006, § 4(Exh. A), 1-28-2014) 
_____ 
17.75.030 - Basic policies. 
The policies and principles stated in this section apply to all signs within the regulatory scope of this chapter, and to all procedures set forth in, or invoked by, this chapter. These policies are to prevail over any other provision to the contrary, even if more specific. 
A.  Administration and Enforcement Authority. The planning director is authorized and directed to administer the provisions of this chapter. The chief of police and planning director are authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Minor and Major Signs. The city council shall adopt, by resolution, and maintain a list of sign types that are determined minor signs or major signs. The regulatory and design review of these signs shall be conducted as follows: 
1.  Major signs shall be reviewed by the design review board. 
2.  Minor signs shall be reviewed administratively by city planning staff. At the specific request of any interested party or staff, any minor sign application may be referred to the design review board for an administrative decision. 
C.  Message Neutrality. It is the city's policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner that is content neutral as to noncommercial messages which are within the protections of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the corollary provisions of the California Constitution. 
D.  Strict Application of Numerical Standards Not Required. In general, no sign should exceed the number, size, height and location limitations of the district in which it is located. However, as rigid numerical or other design standards may preclude exceptional design that might better achieve the purpose and objectives of this chapter, exceptions to the stated numerical or design standards, including size, shape, and location, may be approved by the approving authority when appropriate, provided any resulting determinations or approvals shall be supported by clear and descriptive findings that are consistent with and which achieve one or more of the purposes and the objectives of this chapter. No design exceptions may be approved for prohibited signs. For any approval of a sign which does not strictly conform to the stated numerical and design standards set forth in this chapter, the applicable general development plan, or an approved sign program for a specific development or district, the approving authority must first make the following findings in writing: 
1.  The proposed sign achieves the purposes and objectives of this sign ordinance; 
2.  The proposed sign exemplifies innovation and creativity and is appropriate and consistent with the architecture and context of the building and the neighborhood where the sign will be located; and 
3.  The proposed sign is consistent with all applicable sign guidelines or has been determined by the approving authority to better achieve the purpose and objectives of this sign ordinance than the strict application of said sign guidelines and standards; 
E.  Regulatory Interpretations. All regulatory interpretations of this chapter are to be exercised in light of the city's message neutrality policy. Where a particular type of sign is proposed in a permit application, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this chapter, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a "structure" as defined in the building code, then the approving authority shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type that is expressly regulated by this chapter. 
F.  Substitution of Messages. Subject to the property owner's consent, a protected noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message, provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over protected noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot or land use; does not affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted; does not allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its mounting device; does not allow the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message; and does not allow one particular on-site commercial message to be substituted for another without a permit. 
G.  Rules for Noncommunicative Aspects of Signs. All rules and regulations concerning the noncommunicative aspects of signs, such as location, size, height, illumination, spacing, orientation, etc., stand enforceable independently of any permit or approval process. 
H.  Off-site/On-site Distinction. Within this chapter, the distinction between on-site (or on-premises or point of sale) and off-site or off-premises applies only to commercial speech messages. 
I.  Property Owner's Consent. No sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner(s) of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed. For purposes of this policy, "owner" means the holder of the legal title to the property and all parties and persons holding a present right to possession, control or use of the property. 
J.  Legal Nature of Signage Rights and Duties. As to all signs attached to real or personal property, the signage rights, duties and obligations arising from this chapter attach to and travel with the land or other property on which a sign is mounted or displayed. This provision does not modify or affect the law of fixtures, sign-related provisions in private leases regarding signs (so long as they are not in conflict with this chapter), or the ownership of sign structures. 
K.  Sign Programs. Sign programs for specific developments, as well as special sign districts or special sign overlay zones, when approved by the approving authority, may modify the rules stated herein as to sign size, height, illumination, spacing, orientation or other noncommunicative aspects of signs, but may not override or modify any of the basic policies stated in this section. All provisions of this section shall automatically apply to and be deemed a part of any sign program approved after the date on which this provision is initially adopted. 
L.  Severance. If any section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion or provision of this chapter is held invalid or, unconstitutional, or unenforceable, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any other section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion, or provision of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid portion. In adopting this chapter, the city council affirmatively declares that it would have approved and adopted the chapter even without any portion which may be held invalid or unenforceable. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 4(Exh. A), 1-28-2014)  
17.75.040 - Standards. 
All signs shall comply with the requirements of this chapter, and the requirements of all duly adopted sign design guidelines. 
A.  Illumination. 
1.  The light from any illuminated sign shall be so shaded, shielded or directed that the light intensity or brightness shall not cause adverse glare to surrounding areas. 
2.  Except where otherwise expressly permitted, no sign shall be equipped with blinking, flashing or fluttering lights or other illuminating device which has a changing light intensity, brightness or color. 
B.  Placement of Signs. 
1.  Commercial signs shall be located on or within five hundred feet of the property on which the business product, service, or other commercial activity which is being advertised is located, except that commercial signs for businesses located on Granite Drive shall be located on or within one thousand feet of the property on which the business product, service, or other commercial activity which is being advertised is located. Whenever an off-site sign is placed on another property, the off-site sign shall be deducted from the number and area of signs allowed on the property where the off-site sign is located. 
2.  All signs that project over or into the public right-of-way must conform and are subject to an encroachment permit. 
3.  Building signs shall be placed so as not to project above the roof line, except signs may be placed on a parapet wall, and up to the ridge of a mansard roof. 
4.  At street intersections, no sign exceeding thirty inches in height shall be erected within the "clear view zone" as defined in Section 17.75.120. 
5.  Signs placed at or near driveway entries shall not obstruct the view of drivers entering or leaving driveways. 
6.  Signs shall not be placed on trees, utility poles, benches and fences. 
7.  Signs shall not be placed in such a manner as to obstruct a door, window, or fire escape of any building. 
8.  Freestanding signs shall be set back a minimum of three feet from any property line adjacent to a street or the street right-of-way. 
9.  Signs shall not be placed and/or designed in such a manner as to create a traffic hazard. Examples of such sign placement and/or design include, but are not limited to, signs which interfere with traffic sight distances, traffic flow or the visual access to a traffic sign; and signs with color, configuration, text or location which cause them to be mistaken for, or otherwise imitate, a traffic sign or signal. 
C.  Construction Standards. 
1.  All signs shall be constructed in accordance with applicable requirements of R.M.C. Chapter 15.04, Uniform Construction Codes. 
2.  Permanent signs shall be constructed of durable materials. 
3.  Use of banner signs as permanent signs is prohibited. 
D.  Maintenance. All signs shall be maintained in a substantially like new condition. Failure to maintain the sign in its approved condition constitutes a violation of this chapter of the Rocklin Municipal Code. Normal wear and tear of aged signs shall be repaired when they detract from the visible quality of the sign, as determined by the planning director based on the current condition of the sign compared to the appearance of the sign when first installed. Exposed surfaces shall be cleaned and painted if necessary. The structural integrity of signs shall be maintained at all times. Defective parts shall be replaced. Any sign in a state of disrepair is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and may be abated pursuant to Chapter 8.04. When signs are repaired, they must be done so in a manner (paint colors shall match, etc.) that is consistent with the terms of the sign permit. When signs are removed, the wall behind the sign shall be repaired and painted to match the rest of the building wall within thirty days of the date of the removal. 
E.  Abandoned or Unsafe Signs. An abandoned sign, as defined in Section 17.75.120 of this chapter, including its supporting structure, which after a lapse of at least sixty days, no longer identifies the current occupant, or which relates to a time or event which no longer applies, constitutes false advertising/identification and shall be deemed a public nuisance. The abandoned sign, along with any supporting structure, shall be removed by the owner of the sign or the owner of the property on which it is located within thirty days' of written notice by the city. Any sign that, in the opinion of the building official, is unsafe or insecure, shall be deemed an unsafe sign and a public nuisance, and shall be corrected or removed, together with any supporting structure, by the owner of the sign or the owner of the property on which the sign is located, as directed by the building official. Abandoned and unsafe signs are prohibited and the removal shall be the responsibility of the owner of the sign or the owner of the property on which it is located.

17.75.080 - Whitney Ranch Wayfinding Kiosk Program. 
A.  The purpose of the Whitney Ranch Wayfinding Kiosk Program (the "kiosk program") is to promote development of the Whitney Ranch Project so as to direct the traffic related to new residential subdivisions in a manner that minimizes visual clutter, reduces unnecessary traffic through established neighborhoods, and provides an orderly, attractive, high quality image of the Whitney Ranch Project and the city. 
B.  As used in this section, a wayfinding kiosk is a freestanding sign structure that identifies, and provides directional arrows for, the Whitney Ranch Project generally, new residential subdivisions and their associated sales centers, future land uses of undeveloped parcels, village commercial centers, and community assets such as schools, parks and recreation centers. Also included are nonresidential disclosure signs as required by condition B.7.a.(4)(a) of Subdivision Resolution No. 2004-311 and described in the design review application (DR-2005-12) being processed concurrently. 
C.  The planning commission is hereby designated as the reviewing body for the architecture and design of the wayfinding kiosks for the Whitney Ranch Wayfinding Kiosk Program and may impose conditions of approval on the kiosk program to effectuate the purpose and intent of this section. By resolution of the planning commission, the duties imposed by this part may be delegated to the city manager, community development director or their designee. 
D.  Wayfinding kiosks shall be designed as architecturally enhanced structures, that include features such as a roof element, decorative cap and cornice detail, stone-clad or masonry-clad columns, stone-clad or masonry-clad foundation, carved or sculptured wood construction, or other architectural features as determined by the planning commission. 
E.  Wayfinding kiosks shall be located to eliminate or minimize to the greatest extent feasible, any obstruction to the view of traffic or safety signs, encroach within vision triangles, or otherwise pose a traffic hazard as determined by the city engineer and/or director of public works. 
F.  To further the purposes of the kiosk program, the installation of subdivision kiosks shall be in lieu of installing individual off-site subdivision signs allowed by any other part of this chapter. No sign permits shall be approved for home builders or developers eligible to participate in the kiosk program. However, should the Whitney Ranch master developer fail to implement the Whitney Ranch Wayfinding Kiosk Program in a fair and timely manner, any developer or home builder aggrieved by the failure of the master developer to implement the kiosk program in a fair and timely manner may, upon a showing of substantial evidence of unfairness in implementation, be exempted from this requirement by the community development director, who will consider and act upon sign permit applications from said developers or home builders as provided in this chapter.

Chapter 17.77 - OAK TREE PRESERVATION 
Sections: 
 
17.77.010 - Intent and purpose. 
By enacting this chapter of the Rocklin Municipal Code, to be known as the Rocklin Oak Tree Preservation Ordinance the city council finds that oak woodlands constitute a valuable natural resource within the city. They provide habitat for wildlife; they contribute to the city's beauty and varied scenery; they provide shade in parks as well as in developed areas; and they enrich soils and protect watersheds and streams from erosion. Oak woodlands have declined substantially in extent and quality, both locally and regionally. They are continuing to decline under pressures of range forage improvement, flood control, fire suppression and urbanization. The goal of this chapter is to address the decline of oak woodlands due to urbanization through a considered attempt to balance against the social benefits of private property ownership and development. To reach this goal, this chapter implements a comprehensive design review process for new development, offers incentives for oak tree preservation, and provides feasible alternatives and options to removal where practicable. This chapter is enacted in furtherance of Rocklin General Plan/Open Space Conservation and Recreation Element Policies 1 and 4. 
(Ord. 676 § 8 (part), 1993).

2.  A lot zoned for multifamily, commercial or industrial use for which all discretionary entitlements, as well as design review approval under Chapter 17.72, have been approved and are effective. "Developed lot" shall not mean any lot which otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph, but for which another discretionary entitlement, or a modification to an existing entitlement is being requested. Such lots shall be treated as undeveloped lots under this chapter. 
B.  "Guidelines" means the oak tree preservation guidelines adopted pursuant to Section 17.77.100 of this chapter.

Chapter 17.83 - REQUESTS FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
Sections: 
 
17.83.010 - Purpose. 
This section provides a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking access under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies, procedures, and project entitlement exhibits or conditions of approval. 
(Ord. No. 977, Exh. A, A6., 10-11-2011)  
17.83.020 - Applicability. 
A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any property owner, duly authorized tenant or lessee who desires to implement improvements to a specific property that are designed to provide access to housing and/or places of business, when the application of a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy, practice, project entitlement exhibit or condition of approval acts as a barrier to reasonable access. This section is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts. 
A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards, practices, and project entitlement exhibits or conditions of approval for the siting, development and use of structures and facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability with equal opportunity to access housing and places of business. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made in the manner prescribed by Section 17.83.030. 
(Ord. No. 977, Exh. A, A6., 10-11-2011)  
17.83.030 - Application requirements. 
A.  Application. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted as a written request to the community development director (alternative submission formats may be approved by the community development director should a written application be unduly burdensome). All requests shall include the following information: 
1.  The applicant's name, address and telephone number; 
2.  The property owners name, address and telephone number; 
3.  The street address and assessor's parcel number of the property for which the request is being made; 
4.  The current actual use of the property; 
5.  The basis for the claim that an individual or group of individuals considered disabled under the Acts is being denied reasonable accommodation; 
6.  The zoning law, provision, regulation, policy, project entitlement exhibit feature or condition of approval from which reasonable accommodation is being requested; 
7.  Why the requested accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual or group of individuals; 
8.  Photos, site plans, drawings, and/or other graphics as may be needed to make the proposed changes clear. 
B.  Concurrent Review. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval, then the applicant may file the request concurrently with the application for discretionary approval. 
(Ord. No. 977, Exh. A, A6., 10-11-2011)  
17.83.040 - Review authority and procedure. 
A.  Community Development Director. If no approval is sought other than a request for reasonable accommodation, then the request for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the community development director, or his/her designee. The community development director or his/her designee shall make a written determination within five working days and either grant, grant with modifications or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with Section 17.83.050. 
B.  Other Review Authority. Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the authority reviewing the discretionary land use application. The applicable review authority shall make a written determination and either grant, grant with modifications or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with Section 17.83.050. 
(Ord. No. 977, Exh. A, A6., 10-11-2011)  
17.83.050 - Findings and decision. 
A.  Findings. The written decision to grant, grant with modifications or deny a request for reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on consideration of the following: 
1.  Whether the facility which is the subject of the request will be used by an individual or a group of individuals considered disabled under the Acts, and that the accommodation requested is necessary to make the specific facility accessible to the individual or group of individuals with (a) disability(ies) under the Acts; 
2.  Whether there are alternative reasonable accommodations available that would provide an equivalent level of benefit, or if alternative accommodations would be suitable based on the circumstances of this particular case; 
3.  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; 
4.  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would be consistent with the general plan land use designation of the property which is the subject of the reasonable accommodation request, and with the general purpose and intent in the applicable zoning district; 
5.  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation substantially affects the physical attributes of the property. 
B.  Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 977, Exh. A, A6., 10-11-2011)

Chapter 17.94 - TRIP REDUCTION 
Sections: 
 
17.94.010 - FindingsPurposeObjectivesIntent. 
A.  The city council finds and determines that increasing employment opportunities and residential construction in the city and in Placer County are projected to create a substantial increase in traffic volumes. The geographical location and atmospheric conditions of the city and Placer County are conducive to the formation of air pollution attributed largely to motor vehicle emissions. California Health and Safety Code § 40919(d), as modified by the California Clean Air Act of 1988, mandates that in serious non-attainment areas such as Placer County, there will be no net increases in vehicular emissions by 1997 and by 1999, an average vehicle ridership (AVR) of 1.4 will be attained in the weekday commute period. California Government Code § 65089.3 (b) (3) and the Placer County congestion management plan requires all jurisdictions within Placer County to adopt and implement a trip reduction ordinance. Ridesharing among employees for home-to-work trips is a simple, inexpensive, and effective means of reducing single occupant motor vehicle trips. A reduction in such trips can be expected to result in an improvement to the region's air quality, and a reduction in traffic congestion and energy consumption impacts related to the anticipated growth in new jobs and residential construction. Cooperation with and coordination of trip reduction programs with other cities, counties, and communities in the region and through regional agencies would enhance the effectiveness of such programs. 
B.  The purposes of this chapter are the following: 
1.  Reduce total vehicle emissions in Placer County and South Placer region by reducing the number of vehicular trips that might otherwise be generated by home-to-work commuting; 
2.  Reduce traffic congestion in Placer County by reducing both the number of vehicular trips and the vehicular miles traveled that might otherwise be generated by home-to-work commuting; 
3.  Reduce or delay the need for major transportation facility improvements and reduce congestion by making efficient use of existing facilities; 
4.  Reduce present and future motor vehicle emissions as a contribution for complying with federal and state ambient air quality standards; 
5.  Implement measures that will work towards attainment of ambient air quality standards and compliance with congestion management program (CMP) requirements; 
6.  Increase the average vehicle ridership (AVR) during the weekday commute period ("peak period") to work towards goals set forth in the California Clean Air Act. 
C.  The fundamental objective of this chapter is to increase the average vehicle ridership (AVR) for home-to-work commuting to an average of 1.4 passengers per vehicle (AVR = 1.4). Large employment facilities or common work locations will be expected to accomplish a higher portion of this reduction than small employment centers in recognition of the greater opportunity for rideshare matches and increased viability of transit at large employment facilities. 
D.  The intent of this chapter is that employers strive to reach the goal of an average vehicle ridership (AVR) of 1.4 persons per vehicle within the air basin by 1999 in compliance with the California Clean Air Act. Employers and property controllers are required to put forth a good faith effort to encourage employees to use alternative transportation modes through the methods described below. 
(Ord. 693 § 2 (part), 1993).  
17.94.020 - Definitions. 
A.  "Alternative commute mode" means method of traveling to and from the worksite other than by single occupant vehicle (i.e., transit, carpool, vanpool, bicycle, walking, telecommuting). 
B.  "Average vehicle ridership (AVR)" means the average number of persons occupying each vehicle. AVR is calculated by multiplying the number of employees by the standard number of trips in a work week (generally ten), then divided by actual number of vehicular trips per work week. For example, if all employees drive alone to work each day, the AVR = 1.0. Ten employees would be expected to take ten trips each per week for a total of one hundred trips. If only sixty-seven vehicular trips are taken, then the AVR is 1.4, which means that, on average, each vehicle is transporting 1.4 people to their destination. The higher the AVR, the more people are using alternative transportation methods. 
C.  "Carpool" means a motor vehicle occupied by two or more persons traveling to and from work. 
D.  "Common work location" means single building, building complex, campus, or work sites at common location. A common work location is typified by a common private parking lot or area to be used by employees, tenants, customers, and/or other visitors to the complex, notwithstanding parking slot designations, such as specific spaces designated for specific tenants. To be considered a common work location, the site must have a central contact point, such as property manager or property owner. There are different requirements depending on the existence of a central contact point. 
E.  "Commuter" means an employee who travels regularly to and from a work facility three or more days a week. 
F.  "Commuter matching service" means any system for mapping and matching home and work locations of interested commuters to identify prospects for ridesharing. 
G.  "Employee transportation coordinator (ETC)" means an employee or other individual designated by an employer or project controller to coordinate and implement TCM activities as required by the transportation plan. 
H.  "Peak period commuter" means any employee who travels regularly to and from a work facility three or more days a week and arrives or departs from the facility during the weekday peak period specified by the city. This peak period shall be linked to the hours that commuter congestion actually occurs. 
I.  "Project controller" means the owner, lessor and/or manager of a common work location. 
J.  "Rideshare program" means the commuter matching service and commuter information service operated by the South Placer TMA or Caltrans-Sacramento Rideshare. 
K.  "Ridesharer" means any employee who commutes to and from his or her work location by any mode other than single occupancy light or medium duty vehicle, motorcycle, or moped. 
L.  "Shift of employment" means any group of employees who work at a common work location and who arrive and depart from work in a common time interval not greater than one hour. 
M.  "Single occupant vehicle (SOV)" means a motor vehicle occupied by one employee for commute purposes. 
N.  "Transportation control measures (TCMs)" means measures used to maintain or improve the efficient movement of persons and goods while reducing the congestion and air quality impacts associated with motorized vehicles. 
O.  "Transportation control measure (TCM) coordinator" means a city employee designated by the city manager to manage and enforce employer compliance with TRO requirements. 
P.  "Transportation management association (TMA)" means an association, usually of employers, developers, property managers, and public agencies, organized to facilitate, support, and encourage the use of alternative transportation methods for commuters. 
Q.  "Transportation plan" means the plan developed by the employer or project controller to reduce single occupant vehicle trips, pursuant to Section 17.94.050(B). 
R.  "Trip reduction credit" means the number of points credited to an employer's transportation plan for implementing a specific transportation control measure (TCM) program. 
S.  "Vanpool" means a motor vehicle, other than a motor truck or truck tractor, suited for occupancy by more than six but less than sixteen persons including the driver, traveling to and from work. 
(Ord. 693 § 2 (part), 1993).  
17.94.030 - RequirementsLevel 1 (all employers, and common work locations). 
A.  Providing Information. Every employer and common work location shall encourage use of alternative commute modes by providing the following: 
1.  Posting in a conspicuous place or places informational material provided or updated annually by the TCM coordinator, to encourage ridesharing, such as:

b.  The location of all bicycle routes within at least a five-mile radius of the facility, 
c.  Posters or flyers encouraging the use of ridesharing and referrals to sources of information concerning ridesharing; 
2.  Disseminating annually to all tenants and employees, and to new tenants and new employees when hired, written information provided by the TCM coordinator regarding an area-wide commuter ridesharing matching service. 
All posters, flyers, schedules, maps, and other information required for compliance with this section will be provided by the city on an annual basis or as updates occur. 
B.  Survey. All employers and common work locations shall complete and return to the TCM coordinator an annual survey regarding employees' use of alternative transportation modes. For employers of less than fifty, a brief survey form on a postcard will be used. Employers of more than fifty shall be provided a more detailed survey form for completion.
