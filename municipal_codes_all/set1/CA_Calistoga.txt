provided in this code and filed with the enforcement officer within the time specified under CMC

rights to an administrative hearing for determination of the matter, and (ii) a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies. (Ord. 737 § 2, 2018; Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).

1.12.090 Service.

person. If a copy of the notice cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered, the notice shall be
served by (1) certified first class mail, return receipt requested, and (2) regular mail.
B. A copy of the notice shall also be conspicuously posted in front of the property on which the nuisance exists,
or if posting on the front of the property is not possible, then the notice may be posted in any other location of the
property wherein it will be most likely to give notice to the owner.
C. Notices by United States mail may be served on the responsible person(s) at the address as shown on the
last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll of Napa County, whichever is more current. The
enforcement officer may, upon the advice of the City Attorney, also serve notice on a tenant, a mortgagor, or any
other person having an interest in the real property. Service shall be effective on the date of mailing.
D. The failure of any owner or responsible person to receive the notice shall not affect in any manner the validity
of the proceedings taken hereunder. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.100 Hearing procedure.
A. Continuances. The City may continue a hearing from time to time, and may request additional information
from the enforcement officer or the cited responsible person before issuing a decision.
B. Burden of Proof. The enforcement officer shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence
that a public nuisance exists.
C. Failure to Appear. The failure of the cited responsible person to appear at the hearing shall constitute a failure
to exhaust his/her administrative remedies.
D. At the Hearing. At the hearing, the cited responsible person shall be given the opportunity to testify, call
witnesses, and to present evidence concerning the abatement order, including any evidence to show cause why
the violation should not be abated at the cost of the cited responsible person.
1. Oath or Affirmation. All oral evidence or testimony shall be taken under oath or affirmation. The presiding
officer may administer the oath. In a given case where many witnesses are expected to testify, the
presiding officer has the discretion to have all prospective witnesses rise and be sworn at the same time at
the outset of the proceedings.
2. Evidence. The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS Page 26 of 870
witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons customarily rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law
or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions.
Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but shall not
be sufficient in and of itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions.
Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
3. Witnesses. In a contested proceeding each side shall have these rights: to call and examine witnesses;
to introduce exhibits; to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues; to
impeach any witness and to rebut the evidence against a party. The Council has the discretionary authority
to: limit the number of witnesses to testify for each side where their testimony would be cumulative or
repetitive in nature; require each side to appoint one spokesperson for purposes of cross-examination; limit
or curtail any abusive, argumentative, repetitive, or otherwise irrelevant cross-examination; and place
reasonable time limits on the right to cross-examine and present evidence. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.110 Council’s decision.
A. Decision. After considering the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the Council shall issue a
resolution approving, modifying, or rescinding the enforcement officer’s order. The Council’s decision shall
identify the responsible person’s obligation to pay all enforcement costs (including any amounts owed through
the date that all violations are corrected).
B. Finality of Decision. The decision of the Council shall be final. Nothing in this section shall in any way
preclude or limit any aggrieved party from seeking judicial review after such person has exhausted the
administrative remedies provided by this section. However, it shall be conclusively presumed that a person has
not exhausted his/her administrative remedies as to any issue which is not raised in the administrative
proceedings authorized herein, or if the person failed to appear before the Council. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.120 Service of the Council’s resolution.
The City officer authorized to abate the nuisance shall serve a copy of the resolution upon the responsible
person in accordance with the service procedures described in CMC 1.12.090.
Furthermore, if the Council determines that the abatement of the nuisance is likely to cause a significant
depreciation in the value of the property, the Council may order that mortgages and/or beneficiaries under any
deeds of trust of record on the property be served with a copy of the resolution in the manner prescribed in this
chapter. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.130 Abatement by owner or occupant.
The owner or responsible person may, at his/her own expense, abate the nuisance in the time and manner
presented in the order to abate issued by the enforcement officer. If an enforcement officer determines that the
nuisance has been properly abated, then proceedings pursuant to this chapter shall be terminated; provided,
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS Page 27 of 870
however, that the City may in its discretion proceed with recovery of such abatement costs as it may have
incurred before abatement by the owner. Nothing in this chapter shall relieve any owner or other responsible
person of the obligation of obtaining any required permits to do any work incidental to such abatement. (Ord. 677
§ 2, 2011).
1.12.140 Abatement by City.
Where a responsible person fails to abate a nuisance in conformance with an abatement order or a resolution of
the Council, the enforcement officer may direct any City employee, contracting agent or other representative to
enter upon private property for the purpose of abating the public nuisance. Before entering the property, the
enforcement officer shall secure written permission from the responsible person to enter upon the property and
abate the nuisance. If the property owner or occupant with right of possession is unwilling to provide such
permission, the enforcement officer may pursue any warrant deemed necessary by the City Attorney.
Should it be practicable to sell or salvage any material procured from the aforesaid abatement, it may be sold at
private or public sale at the best price obtainable and an itemized account of the proceeds shall be maintained by
the authorized City officer. Such proceeds, if any, shall be deposited in a general fund of the City and shall be
credited against the cost of abatement. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.150 Judicial review – General time limits.
The time limits for review of any Council decision under this chapter are governed by CMC 1.08.070. (Ord. 677
§ 2, 2011).
1.12.160 Hearing before Council on cost recovery.
A. Upon completion of an abatement action, the enforcement officer shall prepare and file with the Administrative
Services Director a report stating the costs incurred by the City in abating the nuisance. If a responsible person
is an owner of real property, the amount owed by the responsible person under this section may be made a lien
or special assessment against the real property on which the violation occurred.
B. Lien or Special Assessment Procedure.
1. The Administrative Services Director shall fix a date, time, and place for the Council to consider the
report and any protests or objections to it. The Administrative Services Director shall provide written notice
to the property owner and any other responsible person not less than 10 days before the hearing in
conformance with CMC 1.12.090.
2. A person whose real property may be subject to a lien or special assessment may file a written protest
with the Administrative Services Director and/or may protest orally at the hearing. Each written protest or
objection must contain a description of the property at issue and the grounds of the protest or objection.
3. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Council shall adopt a resolution confirming, discharging, or
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS Page 28 of 870
modifying the amount of the lien or special assessment.
C. Upon a determination of the Council to adopt a lien or special assessment, the Administrative Services
Director shall provide notice of the lien or special assessment to the responsible person. For a lien, the notice
shall be served as provided in California Government Code Section 38773.1. For a special assessment, the
notice shall be served as provided in California Government Code Section 38773.5. The Administrative Services
Director shall also record any applicable resolution adopted under this section as a lien or a special assessment
in the office of the County Recorder of Napa County.
D. Once payment in full is received by the City for the amount of the lien or special assessment set forth in the
written order, plus any applicable interest or penalties, the Administrative Services Director shall record a notice
of discharge with the office of the County Recorder. The notice of discharge shall cancel the City’s lien or
special assessment. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.170 Emergency abatement.
A. Emergency Abatement Authorized. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, whenever the City
Manager reasonably determines there is a nuisance that poses an imminent or immediate danger of significant
harm to persons or property, or so endangers the public health or safety, the City may act immediately and
without prior notice or hearing to abate the condition. Any emergency abatement under this section shall be
authorized in writing by the City Manager or his/her designee and shall be limited to those actions necessary to
eliminate the immediate threat. After the immediate threat is eliminated, the enforcement officer may abate any
remaining violations through the formal abatement procedures provided for in this chapter.
B. Evidence Gathering. Before commencing an emergency abatement, the enforcement officer shall gather
evidence of the nuisance to be abated by taking pictures or otherwise documenting the nuisance requiring
emergency abatement. All such evidence gathering must be done in compliance with CMC 1.12.050.
C. Notice. Before commencing an emergency abatement, the enforcement officer shall make reasonable
attempts to contact the owner or other responsible person by phone or in person. Written notice of the
emergency abatement shall be provided to the owner or other responsible person within 48 hours of the
abatement. The written notice shall include the following:
1. A statement explaining the City’s power to abate the nuisance under this section;
2. The information provided for in CMC 1.12.060(B)(1), (2), (5), and (6);
3. A copy of this chapter; and
4. The time and method for requesting a post-abatement hearing as provided for in subsection (E) of this
section.

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS Page 29 of 870
D. Costs. The City may recover the expense or cost resulting from the emergency abatement from the owner or
other responsible person in accordance with CMC 1.12.040.
E. Post-Abatement Hearing. An owner or other responsible person may request a hearing before the Council to
determine whether the nuisance should have been summarily abated by filing a written request with the City
Manager within 15 days of the service of notice set forth in subsection (C) of this section. Such request must be
in substantial conformance with CMC 1.12.070. Failure to request a hearing within the time allotted shall
constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.180 Abatement by civil action.
A civil action may be brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the City Attorney, the District
Attorney, or Napa County Counsel to abate a public nuisance. Each of said officers shall have concurrent right to
bring such action to abate a public nuisance within this City. The City Attorney shall bring such action when
directed to do so by the Council. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).
1.12.190 Public nuisance by judicial decree.
If a public nuisance tax has been declared by judicial decree, after a defendant receives notice of entry of
judgment as prescribed by law, and the time within which an appeal may be filed has expired, all procedures of
this chapter shall be applicable and shall be followed in the same manner as if a resolution by the Council had
been passed declaring a public nuisance to exist. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2011).

conditions on land use entitlements is vital to the protection of the public’s health, safety and welfare, and such
enforcement is a valid exercise of the City’s police power. Issuing administrative citations encourages voluntary

the date of the hearing. If multiple citations are being appealed, the City Clerk and hearing officer may
consolidate the appeals into one hearing.
E. Failure of a responsible person to appeal the administrative citation within the timeframe provided by this
section shall constitute: (1) a waiver of any right to an administrative hearing for a determination of the matter

final determination and conclusive evidence of the named responsible person’s liability for the citation. (Ord. 725,

or the responsible person contesting the administrative citation before issuing a written decision.

1.28.090 Hearing officer’s decision.
A. After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision to uphold, modify, or cancel all or part of the administrative citation, listing the reasons for the

issuance of the hearing officer’s decision. (Ord. 725, 2016).

in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6. (Ord. 725, 2016).
1.28.120 Collection of unpaid fines and costs.
A. To recover past due administrative citation fine(s) and recoverable costs:
1. The enforcement officer shall cause a copy of the citation(s) to be filed with the City’s Administrative
Services Department.
2. An invoice for the citation fine(s) and recoverable costs shall be mailed to the property owner and/or
responsible party.
a. The invoice for property-related citations shall include notification that if not paid within 30 calendar
days of the date due, a lien and/or assessment on the property may be recorded.
b. The invoice for non-property related citations shall include notification that if not paid within 30
calendar days of the date due, the account may be referred to a collection agency.
3. If the property owner and/or responsible party does not pay the non-property related citation fine and
recoverable costs within 30 calendar days from the date due, the account may be forwarded to a collection
agency.
4. If the property owner and/or responsible party does not pay a property related citation fine and
recoverable costs within 30 calendar days from the date due, City Manager or designee may authorize that
a lien on the property be recorded.
5. If the property related citation fine and recoverable costs remain unpaid 45 calendar days from the due
date, the City Manager may submit the matter as a report to the City Council for a special assessment
hearing. The report shall include, at a minimum, the names and addresses of the record owner of the
property and all persons having any record interest in the property (including but not limited to holders of
mortgages or deeds of trust), the date upon which the violation occurred, a description of the real property
subject to the lien, and the total costs.
6. At least 10 calendar days prior to the hearing, the City Clerk shall give notice, by certified mail, of the
hearing to all persons named in the report. The notice shall describe the property by assessor’s parcel
number and street number or some other description sufficient to enable identification of the property and
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS Page 43 of 870
contain a statement of the amount of the proposed assessment.
7. At the time fixed for receiving and considering the report, the City Council shall hear the report and the
objections of any of the owners liable to be assessed for the costs or any other persons who may have a
legal interest in the property. The City Council may add to the proposed assessment an amount equal to the
cost of conducting the assessment hearing. The City Council may also make such other modifications in
the report as it deems necessary, after which the Council may order the report confirmed. The order and
modified report shall be filed with the City Clerk and shall be final and conclusive.
8. The amounts and the costs mentioned in the report as confirmed shall constitute a special assessment
against such property and are a lien on the property for the amount of the respective assessment. The
assessment shall continue until it is paid, together with interest at the legal maximum rate computed from
the date of confirmation of the statement until payment.
9. The County Assessor shall enter each assessment on the county tax roll upon the parcel of land. The
assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are
collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and procedure and sale in case of delinquency as is
provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of
municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the
citation and recoverable costs relate has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value,
or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date
on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the citation and recoverable costs
shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for
collection. The tax collector’s power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to
receive notice.
B. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the City Manager may, on behalf of the City, collect any
citation fines and recoverable costs by use of all available legal means, including filing an action in a court of law
or small claims court, and the choice of one remedy does not affect the City’s ability to use alternative remedies.
(Ord. 725, 2016).

required to be given under this chapter, it must be given as follows:

2.22.010 Purpose and findings.
A. The City desires to harmonize relations and to resolve disputes which may, from time to time, exist between
residents and owners of mobile home parks or which may arise in the future from the failure of any party to
recognize the property rights of another or from engaging in acts or practices which might jeopardize the public
health, safety, or welfare.
B. The Council conducted public hearings during which residents of the mobile home parks and owners of mobile
home parks and their representatives expressed, and the Council considered, all of the expressed points of
view, both oral and written, concerning property rights and the protection of the public health, safety, and
welfare. The minutes of the February 2, 1993, March 23, 1993, April 6, 1993, April 20, 1993, May 4, 1993, and
May 18, 1993, Council meetings or study sessions are hereby incorporated by reference. Based on the
information presented, the Council made the following findings:
1. Residents of mobile home parks, unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental properties, are in a
unique position in that they have made a substantial investment in a residence for which space is rented or
leased. The removal or relocation of a mobile home from a park space is generally accomplished at
substantial cost. Such removal or relocation may cause extensive damage to the mobile home.
2. Mobile homes provide an important alternative form of housing.
3. The potential for rents to increase within mobile home parks within the City could cause a hardship to a
substantial number of mobile home homeowners and residents of the parks, most of whom are elderly, on
fixed incomes, or persons of low income.
4. It is necessary to protect mobile home homeowners and residents of mobile home parks from
unreasonable rent increases and at the same time recognize the rights of mobile home park owners to
maintain their property and to receive just and reasonable return on their investments.
5. The enactment of this chapter will not have a significant impact upon the physical environment of the
community in that there will be no deviation from the General Plan and there will be no change in the
present use of property within the City on account of enactment hereof.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 75 of 870
C. Based on the aforementioned findings, the City enacted Ordinance 493. On April 13, 1995, May 16, 1995, and
June 6, 1995, the Council reviewed amendments to Ordinance 493. The minutes of these Council meetings and
study sessions are hereby incorporated by reference. The Council makes the following additional findings:
1. The mobile home park space vacancy rate in the City is under one percent. There are no new parks
being built nor is it foreseeable that existing parks will expand. The cost of moving a mobile home today is
exorbitant and averages over $6,000. Mobile homes provide true affordable housing that needs to be
preserved. There continues to be a need to prevent excessive space rent increases which could result in
threats to health and safety and possible economic eviction.
D. The purpose of this chapter is to stabilize mobile home park space rents to:
1. Prevent exploitation of the shortage of vacant mobile home park spaces;
2. Prevent excessive and unreasonable mobile home park space rent increases;
3. Rectify the disparity of bargaining power that exists between mobile home park homeowners and mobile
home park owners;
4. Provide mobile home park owners with a rate of annual space rent increase that reflects the impact of
inflation and/or increases in their expenses;
5. Provide a process for ensuring mobile home park owners a fair, just, and reasonable rate of return on
their parks in cases where the annual space rent increase provided by this chapter proves insufficient;
6. Provide continued rent stabilization on the sale or transfer of a mobile home on-site to prevent
unnecessary and unreasonable rent increases to new mobile home homeowners. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord.
513 § 1, 1995).

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 81 of 870
retain rent for that space exceeding the rent in effect during the last month the space was rented prior to

2. If a mobile home space is exempted from the provisions of this chapter because it is the subject of a
rental agreement pursuant to California Civil Code Section 798.17(a) and (b), and that agreement expires

the space rent in effect for that space prior to the expiration of the rental agreement, excluding separately
billed pass-throughs for capital improvements.

B. A park owner shall be permitted to charge a new base rent for a mobile home space whenever a lawful
vacancy occurs. For purposes of this chapter, “lawful space vacancy” shall mean:
1. A vacancy occurring because of the termination of the tenancy of a mobile home homeowner in
accordance with California Civil Code Sections 798.56 through 798.58; or
2. A vacancy of the mobile home space arising from the voluntary removal of a mobile home from the
mobile home space by the affected mobile home homeowner. A removal of the mobile home from the space
for the purpose of performing rehabilitation or capital improvements to the space or for the purpose of
upgrading the mobile home shall not constitute a voluntary removal of the mobile home.
C. Any alleged violation of this section shall be subject to automatic arbitration pursuant to CMC 2.22.090(F).
(Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
2.22.060 Anniversary date.
The anniversary date for all rent increases in the park owner’s park shall be established by City Council
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 82 of 870
resolution at a public hearing. All affected parties shall be notified in writing 30 days prior to said hearing. Such
rent increases, if any, except as specified below, shall be enacted only on the anniversary date of that park. The
park owner shall post the anniversary date in the park office or office areas where it can easily be seen by the
homeowners. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
2.22.070 Rent increase limitations.
A. From and after the effective date of this chapter, space rent shall not be increased within 12 months of the
effective date of the preceding rent increase unless otherwise determined by an arbitrator as provided elsewhere
in this chapter. The permissible annual increase shall be the lesser of:
1. One hundred (100) percent of the percent change in the CPI; or
2. Six percent of the base rent.
B. A park owner may not increase the space rent within a 12-month period, unless the park owner can clearly
establish that the rental increase is necessary to cover costs of operation, maintenance, capital improvements
or substantial rehabilitation not reasonably foreseeable at the time notice of the preceding rent increase was
given. If a park owner seeks a rent increase pursuant to this subsection, the procedures set forth in CMC
2.22.080 and 2.22.090 shall be followed.
C. If a park owner wishes to increase the space rent on the anniversary date or within a 12-month period more
than the amount permitted in subsection (A) of this section and less than 300 percent of the percent change in
the CPI, the procedures set forth in CMC 2.22.080 and 2.22.090 shall be followed.
D. If a park owner wishes to increase the rent payable for any mobile home space on the anniversary date or
within a 12-month period in an amount equal to or more than 300 percent of the percent change in the CPI, the
procedures set forth in CMC 2.22.080 and 2.22.090 shall be followed except that the petition requirements of
CMC 2.22.090(C) and (D) shall not apply because an arbitration shall automatically be required to show good
cause why such an increase is necessary.
E. The arbitrator may reduce the proposed rent increases pursuant to subsections (B), (C) or (D) of this section
to a figure determined upon the evidence submitted by the park owner or the park owner’s representative to be a
fair return.
F. Any notice of space rent increase given by a park owner pursuant to this section shall be given in writing at
least 90 days before any rent increase is to take effect. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 531 § 1, 1997; Ord. 513 § 1,
1995).
2.22.080 Information to be supplied by park owner.
A. Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter and upon re-renting of each mobile home space
thereafter, the park owner shall supply each affected homeowner or prospective homeowner with a copy of the
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 83 of 870
thereafter, the park owner shall supply each affected homeowner or prospective homeowner with a copy of the
City Information Sheet, which introduces the Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization Ordinance, its benefits, and
contact information of the Administrator.
B. Whenever the park owner serves a notice of rent increase, except a notice of rent increase provided pursuant
to CMC 2.22.070(A), the park owner shall at the same time and in the same manner serve the affected
homeowner or prospective homeowner with a notice that sets forth all of the following information:
1. The amount of the rent increase both in dollars and as a percentage of existing rent and documentation
supporting the level of increase desired, including at a minimum if relevant to the issue: a summary of the
unavoidable increases in maintenance and operating expenses; a statement of the cost, nature,
amortization, and allocation among mobile home spaces of any substantial rehabilitation or capital
improvement; a summary of the increased cost of the park owner’s debt service and the date and nature of
the sale or refinancing transaction; a summary of the park owner’s net operating income of the preceding
24 months and other relevant information that supports the level of rent increase desired;
2. A current listing of all other affected homeowners and the spaces which they rent may be requested
through a designated homeowner association (HOA);
3. The address and telephone number of the Administrator and statement that the homeowner is
encouraged to contact the Administrator for an explanation of the provisions of this chapter;
4. A copy of the petition form prepared and provided by the Administrator which initiates the process of rent
review established by this chapter;
5. If applicable, notification that the proposed rent increase exceeds 300 percent of the change in the CPI,
and that arbitration is automatically required by the provisions of CMC 2.22.070(D) without any need to file
an arbitration petition. Such notices shall bear the following language in capital letters: “ARBITRATION OF
THE PROPOSED INCREASE IS AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRED IN THIS MATTER BY OPERATION OF
LAW.” Erroneous use of this notice shall be regarded as an irrevocable stipulation to submit to arbitration;
6. Time and place for a mandatory informational meeting with the homeowners to be held on the mobile
home park premises. The informational meeting shall be held within 10 days from the service of the notice
of rent increase.
C. The park owner shall, at the same time, file with the Administrator two copies of the notice and summary of
expenses required above, along with two copies of all relevant financial records, bills or documents which
substantiate the level of increase proposed. This financial information shall be verified in writing by an auditor or
certified public accountant or certified in writing as true and correct under penalty of perjury by the owner. This
information will be made available at City Hall for inspection and copying by the affected homeowners.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 84 of 870
D. A park owner failing to provide any information, documents, or notices required by this section shall not be
entitled to collect any rent increase that might otherwise be awarded by an arbitrator. Such failure by the park
owner shall be a defense in any action brought by the park owner to recover possession of a mobile home space
or to collect any rent increase from the homeowner.
E. An affected homeowner who is given notice of a rent increase is entitled to file a petition for space rent review
as provided in CMC 2.22.090 regardless of whether the park owner has failed to provide the affected
homeowner(s) with all the information, documents and notices required by this chapter. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord.
531 §§ 2 – 4, 1997; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
2.22.090 The rent dispute resolution process.
A. The homeowner may contact the Administrator for an explanation of the provisions of this chapter.
B. Mediation. If a rent increase is pursuant to CMC 2.22.070(B), (C), or (D), then after service of the rent
increase notice and the production of the accompanying information required by CMC 2.22.080, the park owner
shall set a time and place for a mandatory informational meeting with the homeowners and a mediation meeting
to be held on the mobile home park premises. The informational meeting shall be held within 10 days from the
service of the notice of rent increase. The mediation meeting shall be held within 20 days from the service of the
notice of rent increase or notice from the Administrator that mediation is required pursuant to this section. The
park owner shall give affected homeowners and the Administrator at least 10 days’ advance notice of this
meeting. The park owner and the affected homeowners shall serve any additional documents to be presented at
the mediation on the other party and the Administrator at least five days before the meeting.
The purpose of this mediation meeting shall be to allow and encourage the parties to mediate any differences
they may have concerning the proposed rent increase. At the meeting, the park owner or park owner
representative shall be available to meet with affected homeowners or homeowner representative to explain the
reasons for the proposed rent increase. If the parties agree to a specific rent increase, the mediator shall
prepare a mediation agreement setting forth the terms of the agreement between the park owner and the affected
homeowners. The mediation agreement shall be executed by the parties and a copy of the agreement shall be
filed with the Administrator.
C. Petition.
1. If discussions between the park owner and affected homeowners, either informally or pursuant to
subsection (B) of this section, do not resolve the dispute, the homeowners or their representative(s) may
file with the Administrator a petition for space rent review with a copy of the notice of rent increase within
30 days after receipt of the rent increase notice.
2. The Administrator shall not accept a petition for review of a rent increase unless it has been signed by at
least 51 percent of all affected homeowners.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 85 of 870
3. As soon as possible after a petition has been filed with respect to mobile home spaces which are within a
single park, the Administrator shall, to the extent possible, consistent with the time limitations provided
herein, consolidate petitions involving similarly situated affected homeowners.
4. Upon the filing of a petition, the rent increase is not effective and may not be collected until and to the
extent it is awarded by an arbitrator or until the petition is abandoned by the affected homeowners or their
representative(s). “Abandoned” as used herein shall mean a failure to actively pursue the necessary steps
to prepare the homeowners’ case for the arbitration. An automatic arbitration based upon a 300 percent CPI
increase shall not require active homeowner participation and shall not be considered abandoned due to
lack of homeowner participation.
D. Contents of Petition.
1. The petition for space rent review shall set forth the total number of affected rented spaces in the mobile
home park, shall identify the name of the homeowner who occupies each such space, and shall state the
date upon which the notice of the rent increase was received by the homeowner(s).
2. After obtaining the required signature(s) of affected homeowner(s), the homeowner(s) shall deliver the
petition or mail it by certified mail to the Administrator at the following address: Calistoga City Hall, 1232
Washington Street, Calistoga, California 94515 (or successor address or agency). No petition shall be
accepted unless it is accompanied by the requisite number of signatures and is received in the office of the
Administrator within the 30-day period set forth in subsection (C) of this section. The Administrator shall
provide a copy of the completed petition to the park owner and the arbitrator.
E. Information Questionnaire. After the Administrator has accepted a petition for space rent review, the
Administrator shall remit to the park owner and petitioning homeowners or the homeowner representative an
information questionnaire in such form as the Administrator may prescribe. The completed information
questionnaire must be returned to the Administrator at least five business days prior to the date scheduled for
hearing of the petition by the arbitrator. The Administrator shall provide copies of the completed information
questionnaire to the arbitrator, the mobile home park owner, and the affected homeowners or the homeowner
representative.
F. Assignment of Arbitrator and Hearing Date/Service of Documents. Upon receipt of a petition, or in the event of
an automatic arbitration pursuant to CMC 2.22.070(D), or upon an affected homeowner’s claim of a vacancy
control rent increase violation pursuant to CMC 2.22.050, the Administrator shall, within 15 business days,
assign an arbitrator. The Administrator shall set a date for the arbitration hearing no sooner than 10 nor later than
30 working days after the arbitrator is assigned. The park owner and all affected homeowner(s) shall be notified
immediately in writing by the Administrator of the date, time, and place of the hearing either in person or by
ordinary mail.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 86 of 870
Any additional documents to be presented at the hearing by either the park owner or the affected homeowner(s),
other than those previously submitted pursuant to CMC 2.22.080(C) or subsection (B) of this section, shall be
served on the other party, the Administrator, and the arbitrator at least 10 working days before the hearing by
mail or in-person delivery. All financial documents submitted shall be verified in writing by an auditor or certified
public accountant, or certified in writing as true and correct under penalty of perjury by the park owner.
G. Arbitration Hearing.
1. The park owner and any affected homeowner(s) may appear at the hearing and offer oral and
documentary evidence. Both the park owner and homeowner(s) may designate a representative or
representatives to appear for them at the hearing. The arbitrator may grant or order one continuance to
each party not to exceed 10 business days from the date of the hearing. A further continuance may be
granted if stipulated to by all the parties. The burden of proving that the amount of rent increase is
reasonable shall be on the park owner by a preponderance of the evidence. The hearing need not be
conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. The rules of evidence and
manner of producing evidence shall be those rules set forth in California Government Code Section 11513
for the conduct of hearings under the Administrative Procedure Act. These rules may be relaxed at the
discretion of the arbitrator in the interests of justice.
2. Any party may have electronic recording equipment or a court reporter present to record and prepare a
transcript of the hearing before the arbitrator. Such equipment or reporter shall be provided at that party’s
own expense.
3. Any jurisdictional or procedural dispute regarding the process set forth herein may be decided by the
arbitrator.
4. The arbitrator shall, within 14 days of the conclusion of the hearing, submit by mail a written statement of
decision and the reasons for the decision to the Administrator. The Administrator shall forthwith mail copies
of the decision to the park owner and affected homeowner(s).
5. The decision of the arbitrator, rendered in accordance with this section, shall be final and binding upon
the park owner and all affected homeowners. The decision of the arbitrator will be subject to the provisions
of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5.
H. It is the intent of the Council to have a final decision rendered within 90 days of the initial notice of the rent
increase. The Administrator or the arbitrator may, however, modify the time periods set forth herein at his or her
discretion to promote the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 531 §§ 5, 6, 1997; Ord. 513 § 1,
1995).
2.22.100 Subpoena power.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 87 of 870
Subpoenas, including subpoenas duces tecum, requiring a person to attend at a particular time and place to
testify as a witness, may be issued in connection with any dispute pending before an arbitrator. Subpoenas shall
be issued at the request of the Administrator, an arbitrator, the homeowner(s) or a park owner. Subpoenas shall
be issued and attested by the City Attorney. A subpoena duces tecum shall be issued only upon the filing with
the City Attorney of an affidavit showing good cause for the production of the matters or things desired to be
produced, setting forth in full detail the materiality thereof to the issues involved in the proceedings, and stating
that the witness has the desired matters or things in his or her possession or under his or her control. A copy of
such affidavit shall be served with the subpoena. Any subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter may be served in person or by certified mail, before the hearing for which
attendance is sought. Any subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
shall be deemed issued by and in the name of the Council. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
2.22.110 Standards of review.
A. The arbitrator shall determine whether space rent increases proposed or imposed by the park owner are
reasonable based upon the circumstances and all the provisions of this chapter. The arbitrator shall take into
consideration that the purpose of this chapter is to permit park owners a just and reasonable return, while
protecting homeowners from unnecessary or unreasonable rent increases.
B. The arbitrator shall not allow more than one rent increase per mobile home space per 12-month period, unless
a park owner can clearly establish that the rental increase is necessary to cover costs of operation,
maintenance, capital improvements or substantial rehabilitation not reasonably foreseeable at the time notice of
the preceding rent increase was given.
C. Maintenance of Net Operating Income.
1. It shall be presumed that the base year net operating income adjusted by 75 percent of the increase or
decrease in the CPI since the base year yields a fair return. Park owners shall be entitled to maintain and
increase their net operating income in accordance with this section. The arbitrator shall make a
determination of whether the park owner’s net operating income yields a fair return under this standard.
2. The formula for calculating the fair NOI return shall be as follows:
Fair NOI = Base Year NOI × (1 + .75) % change in CPI
3. Except as provided in CMC 2.22.150, it shall be presumed that the net operating income produced by the
park during the base year provided a fair return.
4. Calendar year 1992 shall be established as the base year for purposes of determining whether a park
owner’s net operating income provides a fair return. If a satisfactory base year is, in the arbitrator’s opinion,
not otherwise available, such as where a park owner did not own the subject property in the base year
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 88 of 870
and/or the 1992 operating expenses are not available, the arbitrator may take evidence of historical factors
to construct a base year.
5. The base year CPI shall be the CPI level in June 1992.
6. The percentage change in the CPI shall be calculated by using the CPI as of the month prior to the
noticed increase.
7. The comparison NOI year shall be the most recent calendar or fiscal year, unless another period is found
by the arbitrator to be more appropriate.
D. New Capital Improvements. A park owner may seek a rent increase based on the cost of a completed new
capital improvement (as defined in CMC 2.22.020(F)), together with a reasonable return upon the capital
improvement investment, only if the park owner has:
1. Obtained the written consent of 51 percent of the spaces in the park (one vote per space); and
2. Established by written verification or other competent evidence to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that
the costs of the new capital improvement are factually correct as claimed; and
3. Cost factored and amortized the costs of the capital improvement over the good faith estimate of the
remaining life of the improvement, but in no event for a period of less than 60 months; and
4. Allocated the increase among affected homeowners on a per space basis and separately itemized such
increase on the rent bill. Such increases shall not be considered included in the base rent for purposes of
the annual permissible rent increases pursuant to CMC 2.22.070(A).
E. Mitigating Factors. In evaluating a space rent increase, the arbitrator shall also consider the following factors
in addition to any other factors the arbitrator deems relevant in order to determine whether there are any
circumstances that may justify a reduction in a proposed rent increase:
1. In the event the park owner reduces or eliminates any housing services, a proportionate share of the
cost savings due to such reduction or elimination shall be passed on in the form of a decrease in existing
rent or a decrease in the amount of a rent increase otherwise proposed or permitted by this chapter.
2. The physical condition of the mobile home space or park of which it is a part, including the quantity and
quality of maintenance and repairs performed during the preceding 12 months.
F. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, no provision of this chapter shall be applied to prohibit the
granting of a rent increase that is demonstrated to be necessary to provide a park owner with a fair and
reasonable return. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 531 § 7, 1997; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 89 of 870
2.22.120 Net operating income.
In evaluating a space rent increase imposed by a park owner to maintain the park owner’s net operating income
from a mobile home park, “net operating income” (NOI) shall mean the gross income (as defined in CMC
2.22.130) of the mobile home park less the operating expenses (as defined in CMC 2.22.140) of the mobile home
park. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
2.22.130 Gross income.
For purposes of calculating net operating income pursuant to CMC 2.22.120, “gross income” shall mean the sum
of the following:
A. Gross space rents, computed as gross space rental income at 100 percent occupancy; plus
B. Other income generated as a result of the operation of the mobile home park, including, but not limited to, fees
for services actually rendered; plus
C. Revenue received by a park owner from the sale of gas and electricity to homeowners where such utilities are
billed individually to the homeowners by the mobile home park owner. Such revenue shall equal the total cost of
the utilities to the homeowners minus the amount paid by the park owner for such utilities to the utility provider;
minus
D. Uncollected space rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the extent that the same are beyond a park owner’s
control. Uncollected space rents in excess of three percent of gross space rent shall be presumed to be
unreasonable unless established otherwise and shall not be included in computing gross income. If uncollected
space rents must be estimated, then the average of the preceding three years’ experience shall be used. (Ord.
644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
2.22.140 Operating expenses.
A. For purposes of calculating net operating income pursuant to CMC 2.22.120, “operating expenses” may
include:
1. Real property taxes and assessments.
2. Utility costs to the extent that they represent costs to the park owner which are not passed through to
homeowners of the mobile home park.
3. Management expenses (including the compensation of administrative personnel, including the value of
any mobile home space offered as part of compensation for such services), reasonable and necessary
advertising to ensure occupancy, legal and accounting services as permitted herein, and other managerial
expenses. Management expenses are presumed to be not more than five percent of gross income, unless
established otherwise.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 90 of 870
4. In addition to the management expenses listed above, if the park owner performs managerial or
maintenance services which are uncompensated, the park owner may include the reasonable value of such
services or operating expenses. Park owner-performed labor shall be limited to five percent of gross
income unless the arbitrator finds that such a limitation would be substantially unfair in a given case. A
mobile home park owner must devote substantially all of the park owner’s time, that is, at least 40 hours
per week, to performing such managerial or maintenance services in order to warrant the full five percent
credit as an operating expense. No credit for such services shall be authorized unless a park owner
documents the hours utilized in performing such services and the nature of the services provided.
5. Normal repair and maintenance expenses for the grounds and common facilities, including but not limited
to landscaping, cleaning, and repair of equipment and facilities.
6. Operating supplies such as janitorial supplies, gardening supplies, and stationery.
7. Insurance premiums prorated over the life of the policy.
8. Other taxes, fees, and permits, except as provided in CMC 2.22.190.
9. Reserves for replacement of long-term improvements or facilities; provided, that accumulated reserves
shall not exceed five percent of gross income.
10. A park owner may include the cost of necessary capital improvement or substantial rehabilitation
expenditures which would exceed existing reserves for replacement. A necessary capital improvement
shall be an improvement required to maintain the common facilities and areas of the mobile home park in a
decent, safe, and sanitary condition or to maintain the existing level of mobile home park amenities and
services. In the event that the capital improvement or substantial rehabilitation expenditure is necessitated
as the result of an accident, disaster, or other event for which the park owner received insurance or other
benefits, only those costs otherwise allowable and exceeding such benefits may be calculated as operating
expenses.
Expenditures for necessary capital improvements to upgrade existing facilities, together with a reasonable
return upon the capital improvement investment made by the park owner, shall be an allowable operating
expense only if the park owner has:
a. Consulted with the affected homeowners prior to initiating construction or implementation of the
capital improvement regarding the nature, purpose and estimated cost of the improvement; and
b. Established by written verification or other competent evidence to the satisfaction of the arbitrator
that the costs of capital improvement provided to the homeowners for their general use are factually
correct as claimed; and
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 91 of 870
c. Cost factored and amortized the costs of the improvement over the good faith estimate of the
remaining life of the improvement, but in no event for a period of less than 60 months; and
d. Allocated the increase among affected homeowners on a per space basis and separately itemized
such increase on the rent bill. Such increases shall not be considered included in the base rent for
purposes of the annual permissible rent increases pursuant to CMC 2.22.070(A).
11. Increases in interest payments which result from one of the following situations or the equivalent
thereof:
a. Refinancing of the outstanding principal owed for the acquisition of a park where such refinancing is
mandated by the terms of a financing transaction entered into prior to July 1, 1993, for instance,
termination of a loan with a balloon payment; or
b. Increased interest costs incurred as a result of a variable interest rate loan used to finance the
acquisition of the park and entered into prior to July 1, 1993.
In refinancing, increased interest shall be permitted to be considered as an operating expense only where the
park owner can show that the terms of the refinancing were reasonable and consistent with prudent business
practices under the circumstances.
B. “Operating expenses” shall not include the following:
1. Debt service expenses, except as provided in subsection (A)(11) of this section;
2. Depreciation;
3. Any expense for which the park owner is reimbursed; or
4. Attorneys’ fees and costs (except printing costs and documentation as required by CMC 2.22.080)
incurred in proceedings before an arbitrator or in connection with legal proceedings challenging the decision
of an arbitrator or the validity or applicability of this chapter.
C. All operating expenses must be reasonable. Whenever a particular expense exceeds the normal industry or
other comparable standard, the park owner shall bear the burden of proving the reasonableness of the expense.
To the extent that the arbitrator finds any such expense to be unreasonable, the arbitrator shall adjust the
expense to reflect the normal industry or other comparable standard. (Ord. 644 § 1, 2007; Ord. 513 § 1, 1995).
2.22.150 Special base year NOI/base rent adjustments.
A. Park owners may obtain a one-time special adjustment to the base year NOI and/or base date rent(s), if the
park owner rebuts the presumption that the base year NOI and/or base date rent(s) yielded a fair return. The
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 2 COUNCIL, ADMINISTRATION AND PERSONNEL Page 92 of 870
arbitrator shall not make such a determination unless the arbitrator has first made at least one of the following
findings:
1. That the park owner’s operating expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to
the three years prior to the base year. The average expenses for this period shall be presumed to reflect
reasonable average annual expenses and the average of such expenses shall be used to calculate and
adjust the base year NOI.
In determining whether the park owner’s operating expenses were unusually high or low, the arbitrator shall
consider whether:
a. The park owner made substantial capital improvements during the base year, which were not
reflected in the rent levels on the base date.
b. Substantial repairs were made due to uninsured damage caused by fire, natural disaster or
vandalism.
c. Maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in
the quality of housing services.
d. Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding the following of prudent business
practice.
2. That the rent was disproportionate due to one of the enumerated factors below:
a. The rent on the base date was exceptionally high or low due to the fact that the rent was not
established in an arms-length transaction.
b. The rent on the base date was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the year by reason
of premiums being charged or rebates given for reasons unique to particular spaces.
B. If the circumstances specified in subsection (A)(2) of this section are demonstrated, the base date rent shall
be adjusted to reflect the rent that would have been received if the base date rent had been set under general
market conditions. In making this adjustment, the arbitrator shall utilize the median rent in effect on the base

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 3 REVENUE, FINANCE AND EXPENDITURE Page 116 of 870
C. Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is
due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties
stated in subsections (A) and (B) of this section. Inasmuch as refusal to pay over public money received under a
duty to pay it over is a felony (California Penal Code Section 424) the tax administrator shall notify the District
Attorney of any operator withholding remittance over three months.
D. Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter
shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
E. Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this
section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid in this chapter. (Ord. 250 § 1, 1965).
3.16.080 Failure to collect and report tax – Determination of tax by tax administrator.
A. If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any
report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall
proceed to obtain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the tax due.
B. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as are able to be obtained upon which
to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the tax administrator shall proceed to
determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided by this chapter.
C. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by
serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so
assessed at the operator’s last known place of address.
D. Such operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the

become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable.
E. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the
manner prescribed in this subsection to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why
said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.
F. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties
should not be so fixed.

this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the
amount of such tax as the operator may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which
records the tax administrator or the tax administrator’s representative shall have the right to inspect at all
reasonable times.
B. Records shall be sufficient to assure that records are complete and all occupancies have been reported by
such means as a sign-in guest ledger, cash register and prenumbered registration forms. Records shall be
sufficient to assure that rents are properly recorded. If the records are deemed to be inadequate by the tax
administrator or through inspection or audit, the operator shall have 60 days to install adequate recordkeeping
procedures.
C. In the event records or recordkeeping procedures are not improved sufficiently to be audited successfully, the
operator shall be liable to the City for the cost of all subsequent audits of the hotel by the City or its
representatives until the records and recordkeeping are sufficient to be audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing practices. (Ord. 496, 1993; Ord. 250 § 1, 1965).

erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (B) and (C) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the
specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date
of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.
B. An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid,
paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received, when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax had been collected was not a transient;
provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the
operator.
C. A transient may obtain a refund of tax overpaid or paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City, by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (A) of this section, but only when the

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 3 REVENUE, FINANCE AND EXPENDITURE Page 118 of 870
tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient paid the tax to the operator
and establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund
from the operator who collected the tax.
D. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes a right thereto by
written records showing entitlement thereto. (Ord. 545 § 1, 1998; Ord. 520, 1996; Ord. 250 § 1, 1965).

1. Police Development Impact Fee.
a. Purpose. Police development impact fees are intended to cover new development’s share of the
costs associated with the replacement of the Calistoga Police Department’s capital equipment. Each
new development project will add to the incremental use of existing police equipment and vehicles. The
existing set of equipment and vehicles will require more frequent replacement due to the greater use
levels associated with new development (and associated service population) in the City. The Police
Development impact fee will help ensure adequate replacement intervals for department equipment and
vehicles.
b. Use of Fee. Fee revenue will be used to replace capital equipment, including patrol vehicles,
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 3 REVENUE, FINANCE AND EXPENDITURE Page 127 of 870
protective equipment and communications technology, after a period of use.
c. Proportionality. The replacement costs of equipment are allocated proportionately between new and
existing development based on their relative share of demand. Replacement costs associated with new
development are similarly allocated between land uses proportional to their relative generation of
demand, as measured by service population.
d. Police Development Impact Fee Fund. There is established and created a fund of the City entitled
“Police Development Impact Fee Fund” and all revenues derived from and moneys collected under this
section, including accrued interest thereon, shall be deposited in such fund. The Police Development
Impact Fee Fund is established for the sole purpose of providing moneys for the replacement of capital
equipment needed for the Calistoga Police Department in providing police services.
2. Fire Development Impact Fee.
a. Purpose. Fire development impact fees are intended to cover new development’s share of the costs
associated with the replacement of the Calistoga Fire Department’s capital equipment. Each new
development project will add to the incremental use of existing department equipment and vehicles.
The existing set of equipment and vehicles will require more frequent replacement due to the greater
use levels associated with new development (and associated service population) in the City. The Fire
Development impact fee will help ensure adequate replacement intervals for equipment and vehicles.
b. Use of Fee. Fee revenue will be used to replace department capital equipment, such as fire
vehicles, protective equipment and communications technology, after a period of use.
c. Proportionality. The replacement costs of equipment are allocated proportionately between new and
existing development based on their relative share of demand. Replacement costs associated with new
development are similarly allocated between land uses proportional to their relative generation of
demand, as measured by service population.
d. Fire Development Impact Fee Fund. There is established and created a fund of the City entitled “Fire
Development Impact Fee Fund” and all revenues derived from and moneys collected under this
section, including accrued interest thereon, shall be deposited in such fund. The Fire Development
Impact Fee Fund is established for the sole purpose of providing moneys for the replacement of capital
equipment needed for the Calistoga Fire Department in providing fire services.
3. Cultural/Recreational Development Impact Fee.
a. Purpose. Cultural/recreational development impact fees are intended to cover the costs associated
with new cultural and recreational facilities required to serve future growth in Calistoga. New
development will add to the incremental need for cultural and recreational facilities.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 3 REVENUE, FINANCE AND EXPENDITURE Page 128 of 870
development will add to the incremental need for cultural and recreational facilities.
b. Use of Fee. Fee revenue will contribute funding towards cultural and recreational facilities.
c. Proportionality. The cultural and recreational facilities and costs allocated to new development are
based on the ratio between capital facilities (parkland and cultural/recreation facilities) and service
population existing at the time the City of Calistoga development impact fee study was prepared. The
scale of the capital facilities and associated costs are directly proportional to the expected levels of
new development. As a result, the costs of these facilities are applied to new development based on
the existing service standard for modified service population. This standard is primarily based on
population but also captures employee and visitor demand.
d. Cultural/Recreational Development Impact Fee Fund. There is established and created a fund of the
City entitled “Cultural/Recreational Development Impact Fee Fund” and all revenues derived from and
moneys collected under this section, including accrued interest thereon, shall be deposited in such
fund. The Cultural/Recreational Development Impact Fee Fund is established for the sole purpose of
providing moneys for the development of cultural and recreational facilities.
4. City Administrative Facilities Development Impact Fee.
a. Purpose. City administrative facilities development impact fees are intended to help maintain
adequate levels of City administrative facilities services in Calistoga, including adequate City Hall and
community center space as well as associated land needs.
b. Use of Fee. Fee revenue will be used to help fund land acquisition and construction of a new City
Hall and community center.
c. Proportionality. The cost of new City administrative capital facilities is allocated proportionately
between new and existing development based on their relative share of demand (as measured by their
relative share of service population) over a 20-year period. The cost share associated with new
development is similarly allocated between land uses proportional to their relative generation of
demand, as measured by service population.
d. City Administrative Facilities Development Impact Fee Fund. There is established and created a
fund of the City entitled “City Administrative Facilities Development Impact Fee Fund” and all revenues
derived from and moneys collected under this section, including accrued interest thereon, shall be
deposited in such fund. The City Administrative Facilities Development Impact Fee Fund is established
for the sole purpose of providing moneys for land acquisition and construction of a new City Hall and
community center.
5. Transportation Development Impact Fee.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 3 REVENUE, FINANCE AND EXPENDITURE Page 129 of 870
a. Purpose. Transportation development impact fees are intended to cover new development’s share of
the costs associated with providing infrastructure improvements necessary to accommodate the
increase in traffic and bicycle-associated improvements associated with new development.
b. Use of Fee. Fee revenue will be used to help fund infrastructure improvements needed to maintain
acceptable traffic operation and provide adequate access for users of alternative modes.
c. Proportionality. The cost of infrastructure improvements is allocated proportionately to p.m. trips
that would be generated by new development. The cost share associated with new development is
based on the allocation that assigns a majority of the total cost to existing residents through other
funding sources, many of which are funded through local taxes.
d. Transportation Development Impact Fee Fund. There is established and created a fund of the City
entitled “Transportation Development Impact Fee Fund” and all revenues derived from and moneys
collected under this section, including accrued interest thereon, shall be deposited in such fund. The

for vehicular capacity and pedestrian and bicycle improvements.
B. The amount of each development impact fee shall be as established by resolution of the City Council. (Ord.
704 § 4 (Exh. A), 2014).
3.28.050 Calculation and payment of development impact fees.
A. Calculation of Development Impact Fees. The amount of each development impact fee assessed on an
applicant for a building permit shall be calculated based on the fee schedule in effect at the time of issuance of
the building permit.
B. Time for Payment of Development Impact Fees. All development impact fees assessed on an applicant shall
be paid by the applicant at the time of issuance of the building permit, except in the case of residential
development, when the payment of such fees may be deferred until the date of the final inspection, or the date
the certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs first, pursuant to Government Code Section 66007.
C. When a project will include both residential and nonresidential uses, the Director shall determine the
development impact fee amounts by applying to each use the applicable fee for that individual use, and add the
totals of fees applicable to all of the uses within the project. (Ord. 704 § 4 (Exh. A), 2014).
3.28.060 Exemptions, credits and adjustments.

such structure has been in use in the past two years; and provided, that no development impact fee shall
be reduced below $0.00.

force, and in some local persons and families having to leave Calistoga in order to secure work. (Ord. 543 § 1,

other penalties and remedies available to the City.
B. Any person, entity or business damaged or aggrieved by such misstatement or misrepresentation shall have
a private right of action against the person, entity or business which made the misstatement or

available interment space within a plot. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 4 CEMETERY REGULATIONS Page 156 of 870
4.04.210 Interment rights.
All plots conveyed shall be presumed to be the sole and separate property of the person(s) named as grantee(s)
in the instrument of conveyance; provided, however, that the spouse of any named grantee shall have a vested
right of interment of his or her remains in any plot conveyed to his or her spouse, which right shall continue for
the duration of the marriage. No conveyance, or other action, shall divest a spouse of a vested right of interment;
provided, however, that a final decree of divorce shall terminate the interment right of the plot owner’s spouse
unless the decree of divorce provides for the right of interment to continue.
In all conveyances to two or more persons as joint tenants, each joint tenant shall have a vested right of
interment of his or her remains in the plot. Upon the death of a joint tenant, the title to the plot immediately vests
in the survivor(s), subject to the vested right of interment of the deceased joint tenant owner.
A vested right of interment may be waived and shall terminate upon the interment elsewhere of the remains of a
person holding an interment right.
An affidavit by a person with personal knowledge setting forth the fact of death of the plot owner and the name of
the person(s) entitled to interment in the plot is complete authorization to the Cemetery Superintendent to permit
interment of the person(s) so entitled in the unoccupied portions of the plot.
An affidavit by any person with personal knowledge setting forth the fact of the death of one joint tenant and
establishing the identity of the surviving joint tenant(s) named in the deed to the plot, when filed with the
Cemetery Superintendent, is complete authorization to the Cemetery Superintendent to permit the interment in
the unoccupied portion of the plot in accordance with the directions of the surviving joint tenant(s) or their
successors in interest.
When there are several owners of a plot, or holders of rights of interment in a plot, they may file written notice
with the Cemetery Superintendent that they have designated one or more persons as their representative(s). In
the absence of such notice or of written protest to an interment, the Cemetery Authority is not liable to any plot
owner or holder of interment rights for permitting an interment in the plot upon the request or direction of any
holder of rights of interment in the plot.
No vested right of interment gives to any person the right to have his or her remains interred in any plot in which
the remains of any person having a prior vested right of interment may have been interred, nor does it give any
person the right to have the remains of more than one person interred in a single grave in violation of the
Cemetery’s rules and regulations. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.220 Family plot held inalienable.
If a plot owned by an individual is used for the interment of that individual’s remains or the remains of a member
of his or her family by birth or marriage, and the plot owner dies without making disposition of the plot either by
specific devise in a will, or by a written declaration filed and recorded in the office of the Cemetery
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 4 CEMETERY REGULATIONS Page 157 of 870
Superintendent, the plot thereby becomes inalienable and shall be held as the family plot of the record owner.
In a family plot, one grave may be used for the plot owner’s remains, one for the remains of the owner’s
surviving spouse, if any, and any remaining space within the plot may be used to inter the heirs of the deceased
plot owner without consent of any person claiming any interest in the plot.
Any surviving spouse, parent, child or heir who has a right of interment in a family plot may submit to the
Cemetery Superintendent a written waiver of such right in favor of any other relative of the deceased plot owner
or of his or her spouse, and upon such waiver the remains of the person in whose favor the waiver is made may
be interred in the plot.
The Cemetery Authority may take and hold any plot conveyed or devised to it by the plot owner so that it will be
inalienable, and interments shall be restricted to the persons designated in the conveyance or devise. (Ord. 592
§ 1, 2003).
4.04.230 Authorization of one plot owner sufficient.
The Cemetery Authority reserves the right to permit an interment upon receiving written authorization of any plot
owner, even if plots are owned by more than one person. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.240 Urn not to be disturbed.
Once an urn containing human remains is within the confines of the Cemetery, no one shall be permitted to open
the urn without the consent of the deceased’s legal representative. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.250 Regulations of improvement.
The manner of improvement and embellishment of burial plots shall be subject to the approval and regulation of
the Cemetery Superintendent who shall make such regulation as shall tend to the greatest degree of permanence
and protection, and give to the grounds and buildings an appearance of harmony and design as far as is possible
under existing conditions and consistent with the purpose to which they are intended and dedicated. (Ord. 592 §
1, 2003).
4.04.260 Grave identification.
Permits issued by the Cemetery Superintendent are required for all grave markers, monuments, and
headstones. All markers, monuments, headstones, and foundations for monuments shall conform to permit
conditions.
The Cemetery Authority reserves the right to prohibit the erection of any vault, monument, headstone or marker
considered by the Cemetery Superintendent inappropriate, either in size, material, design, workmanship, or
location on the grave, burial plot, lot, block or section. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).

hazardous may be removed by order of the Cemetery Superintendent. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.290 Trees and shrubs.
Trees and shrubs shall be planted only by permission of the Cemetery Superintendent. If any tree or shrub
becomes hazardous in the opinion of the Cemetery Superintendent or interferes with the general design of the
Cemetery, the Cemetery Superintendent shall have the right to remove such tree or shrub, or any part thereof.
(Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.300 Grade.
The Cemetery Superintendent shall determine the grade of all plots and reserves the right to change the grade of
any plot as he or she deems necessary. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.310 Right to replat, regrade and use property.
The Cemetery Authority reserves the right to enlarge, reduce, replat or change the boundaries or grading of any
section or part of the Cemetery; to modify, relocate, improve, or regrade roads, drives or walks, or any part
thereof; to lay, maintain and operate, alter, or change pipe lines, gutters, sprinkling systems, and drainage
facilities; to use Cemetery property not held by individual plot owners for any and all cemetery purposes,
including the interring and preparing for interment of human remains, or for any activity necessary, incidental, or
convenient thereto. The Cemetery Authority reserves to itself, and to those lawfully entitled thereto, a perpetual
right of ingress and egress over plots for the purpose of passage to and from other plots. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.320 Reservation of roads, walkways, and alleyways.
No easement or right of interment is granted to any plot owner in any road, avenue, drive, alley or walk within the
Cemetery. Any road, drive, alley or walk within the Cemetery may be used as a means of access to the burial
grounds or buildings for so long as the Cemetery Authority devotes it to that purpose. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).
4.04.330 Flower receptacles and flowers.
The Cemetery Superintendent shall have the authority to remove all floral designs and flowers from any lot or
grave within three days after they have been placed thereon, or as soon as, in the judgment of the Cemetery
Superintendent, they become unsightly. The Cemetery Authority shall not be liable for floral pieces, baskets, or
frames to which such floral pieces are attached. The Cemetery Authority shall not be liable for lost, misplaced,
or broken flower vases or containers. The Cemetery Authority reserves the right to regulate the method of
decorating plots in order to maintain design harmony consistent with the purpose to which the Cemetery is
dedicated. No flowers, bushes, trees, or shrubs may be planted anywhere within the Cemetery without the
express written consent of the Cemetery Superintendent. (Ord. 592 § 1, 2003).

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 4 CEMETERY REGULATIONS Page 159 of 870
The Cemetery Authority shall take reasonable precaution to protect plots, monuments, markers, copings,

from causes beyond its reasonable control, particularly from damage caused by the elements, acts of God, acts

Persons within the Cemetery grounds must walk or ride only on the designated roads, avenues, drives, alleys

service performed by all employees of applicant within the City during the previous calendar year, and dividing

of one full-time employee according to the custom or laws governing such employment. In computing the
average number of persons employed, a fraction of one-half or more of the customary or equal annual full-time
employee hours shall be considered as one additional employee. “Persons employed” includes proprietors and
persons who have an interest in the business as well as relatives and members of the family who render
services. An individual, relative, or employee who furnishes only occasional services to a business, shall not be
included in the computation of average number of individuals employed or engaged as specified in this chapter.
For the purposes of this chapter, an individual furnishing occasional services is an individual who is employed or
engaged in the business no more than 400 hours in a calendar year.
B. “Business” shall mean professions, trades, and occupations and all and every kind of calling whether or not
carried on for profit.
C. “Collector” as used in this chapter shall be deemed to be the person(s) directed to administer this chapter by
the Council.
D. “Gross receipts” shall mean the total amount of the sale price of all sales and the total amount charged or
received for the performance of any act, service, employment or product of whatever nature, for which a charge
is made or credit allowed, whether or not such service, act, employment or product is done or produced as a
part of or in connection with the sale of materials, goods, wares or merchandise. Included in gross receipts shall
be all receipts, cash, credits and property of any kind or nature, and any amount for which credit is allowed by
the seller to the purchaser without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the property sold, the cost
of the material used, labor or service costs, interest paid or payable, the cost of transportation of the property
prior to its purchase, or losses or other expenses. Excluded from gross receipts shall be cash discounts allowed
and taken on sales; any tax required by law to be included in or added to the purchase price and collected from
the consumer or purchaser; and such part of the sale price of property returned by purchaser upon rescission of
the contract of sale as is refunded either in cash or by credit. (Ord. 386 § 3, 1982; Ord. 342 § 1, 1978; prior code

cashier’s check or certified check payable to the City; or cash in the amount of $150.00, which sum shall
be forfeited to the City if award is made to the bidder sending it, and if the bidder thereafter fails or refuses
to enter into contract within 30 days after receiving notice of the award. Bidding shall be on the basis of a
percentage of the gross receipts from collections in the City to be paid by the contractor to the City in
monthly installments as collections are made. The Council shall have the right to reject any and all bids and
also to accept a bid other than the lowest bid if the Council determines that, because of experience,
financial responsibility, or other cause determined by Council to be sufficient, the acceptance of such lower
bid is for the best interest of the City.
2. All contracts awarded on this basis may contain such terms and conditions as the Council may
determine at the time of calling for bids to be necessary and proper. By its resolution calling for bids, the
Council shall prescribe the terms and conditions to be included in the contract awarded and a record of
such terms and conditions to be included shall be kept in the office of the City Clerk for examination by
prospective bidders. The call for bids issued by the Clerk shall refer to the record on file with the Clerk for a
statement of the exact terms and conditions upon which the contract will be made.

under subsection (B) of this section shall contain such provisions as the Council may at the time of calling for
bids determine to be necessary or proper.
D. No contract entered into under this section shall bar the Council from amending this chapter from time to time
in any way considered by the Council to be desirable or proper, including changes in the garbage and rubbish
rates prescribed in CMC 8.16.050; provided, however, that in the event that any amendment substantially affects
the operations of the contractor, the contractor may provide that the contractor shall have the option to terminate
the contract upon notice to be provided in said contract. (Ord. 397 §§ 2, 3, 1984; prior code § 9.2-14).

B. At its discretion, the City may pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies to collect unpaid fines and/or
fees imposed pursuant to this chapter. Pursuit of one remedy does not preclude the pursuit of any other remedy.

attorneys’ fees. Such collection costs shall be in addition to any penalties, interest, and/or late charges imposed
upon the unpaid fine. (Ord. 669 § 2, 2010).

other remedy to which it is entitled under law or equity. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to preclude the
imposition of any criminal penalty, nor shall anything in this chapter be deemed to conflict with any penalty or
provision under State law, or prohibit any conduct authorized by the State or Federal Constitutions. (Ord. 669
§ 2, 2010).

9.17.040 Violation.
9.17.050 Termination – Excessive false alarms.

9.17.010 Definitions.
The following terms are defined for use in this chapter:
A. “Alarm system” means an assembly of equipment and devices or a single device such as a solid state unit
which uses electrical energy to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to which the Police
Department or Fire Department is expected to respond. In this chapter, the term “alarm system” includes but is
not limited to the terms “automatic holdup alarm system,” “burglar alarm system,” “holdup alarm system,” “fire
alarm system,” and “manual holdup alarm system,” as those terms are hereinafter defined. Alarm systems which
monitor temperature, humidity or any other condition not directly related to the detection of an unauthorized
intrusion into premises or an attempted robbery at premises are specifically excluded from the provisions of this
chapter. Also excluded from this definition and from the coverage of this chapter are alarm systems used to alert
or signal persons within the premises in which the alarm system is located of an attempted unauthorized
intrusion or holdup attempt. If a system employs an audible signal emitting sounds or a flashing light or beacon
designed to signal persons outside the premises, the system is within the definition of “alarm system” and is
subject to this chapter.
B. “Automatic holdup alarm system” means an alarm system in which the signal transmission is initiated by the
action of the robber.
C. “Burglar alarm system” refers to an alarm system signaling an entry or attempted entry into the area
protected by the system.
D. “False alarm” means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper
installation, without an unlawful entry, or through the negligence of the owner or lessee of an alarm system or
said person’s employees or agents or other cause.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 9 PUBLIC PEACE AND WELFARE Page 258 of 870
E. “Holdup alarm system” refers to an alarm system signaling a robbery or attempted robbery.
F. “Manual holdup alarm system” refers to an alarm system in which the signal transmission is initiated by the
direct action of the person attacked or by an observer of the attack.
G. “Subscriber” means a person who buys or leases or otherwise obtains an alarm signaling system and
contracts with or hires an alarm business to monitor or service the alarm device. (Ord. 675 § 2, 2011).
9.17.020 Purpose.
The City of Calistoga declares that law enforcement responses to repeated false alarms as defined in this
chapter pose a critical drain on limited police personnel resources, endanger responding officers, and deprive
the general taxpayer of a preventive police presence, thereby endangering the general health and welfare of the
community at large. (Ord. 675 § 2, 2011).
9.17.030 Testing.
A. No alarm system designed to transmit emergency messages directly to the Police Department or Fire
Department shall be tested or demonstrated without first notifying the Police Department dispatcher.
B. No alarm system relayed through intermediate services to the Police or Fire Department will be tested to
determine police response without first notifying the police dispatcher.
C. Any testing done without proper advance notification shall be classified as a “false alarm” for purposes of this
chapter. All notices shall be prior to the testing date unless the Police Chief gives special permission otherwise.
All notices shall include the time, date, owner’s or subscriber’s name, address and the name of the
representative responsible for the testing, and said person’s employer’s name, address and telephone number.
(Ord. 675 § 2, 2011).
9.17.040 Violation.
There shall be no charge for four false alarms per calendar year. Any false alarms over four false alarms per
year shall be deemed a public nuisance and subject to penalty as provided in CMC 1.08.010. (Ord. 675 § 2,
2011).
9.17.050 Termination – Excessive false alarms.
The Police Chief or Fire Chief is authorized to require that the owner or lessee of any alarm system directly
connected to the department disconnect such device until it is working in such a manner as will not produce a
high frequency of false alarms. The Police Chief or Fire Chief may require disconnection if 10 false alarms are
received in any 12-month period. The Police Chief or Fire Chief may, after giving notice to the subscriber, order
disconnection of the system for non-cooperation of the subscriber, or for violations of this chapter. (Ord. 675 § 2,
2011).

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 9 PUBLIC PEACE AND WELFARE Page 259 of 870
9.17.060 Evidence of false alarms.
In determining whether an alarm is a false alarm, all circumstances shall be considered. Setting off an alarm
may cause a person who was attempting a break-in to flee. In investigating whether an alarm is false, a careful
check will be made for signs of attempts to break in, such as scratches around windows. (Ord. 675 § 2, 2011).

the parking citation, a copy of the parking citation to the registered owner.

agency or the issuing officer determines that the issuing officer was in error in issuing the parking citation, the
issuing officer or the issuing agency may recommend, in writing, that the parking citation be cancelled. The
recommendation shall state the reason or reasons for cancellation, and the recommendation shall be filed with
the processing agency.

enforcement agency be grounds for cancellation.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 10 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC Page 268 of 870

registered owner served with a notice of delinquent parking violation has made a bona fide sale or transfer of the

10.06.140 Contesting parking citation – Procedure.
A. If an operator or registered owner contests a parking citation or a notice of delinquent parking violation, the
processing agency shall do all of the following:
1. First, either investigate with its own records and staff or request that the issuing agency investigate the
circumstances of the citation with respect to the contestant’s written explanation of the reason or reasons
for contesting the parking citation.
If, based on the results of that investigation, the processing agency is satisfied that the violation did not
occur, because the registered owner was not responsible for the violation by virtue of having sold, rented,
or leased the vehicle, or because legally supportable or mitigating circumstances as set forth in the City’s
administrative policy warrant a dismissal, the processing agency shall cancel the parking citation and make
an adequate record of the reason or reasons for canceling the parking citation. The processing agency shall
mail the result of the investigation by first class mail to the contestant within 10 days of the decision.
2. If the contestant is not satisfied with the results of the investigation provided for in subsection (A)(1) of
this section, the contestant may, within 15 days of the mailing of the results of the initial investigation,
deposit the amount of the parking penalty and other related fees or provide proof of an inability to deposit
the parking penalty, and request an administrative review.
3. If the contestant prevails at the administrative hearing, then the full amount of the parking penalty
deposited shall be refunded.
B. The administrative review procedure shall consist of the following:
1. The contestant shall make a written request for administrative review on a form and in a manner
satisfactory to the processing agency and any request to contest the parking citation either in person or by
written declaration.
2. If the contestant is a minor, that person shall be permitted to appear at a hearing or admit responsibility
for a parking citation without the necessity of the appointment of a guardian. The processing agency may
proceed against the minor in the same manner as if the minor were an adult.
3. The administrative review shall be conducted before an examiner designed to conduct the review by the
City Council or by the processing agency.
C. The issuing officer shall not be required to participate in an administrative review. The issuing agency shall
not be required to produce any evidence other that the parking citation or copy thereof and information received
from the Department identifying the registered owner of the vehicle.
This documentation in proper form shall be considered prima facie evidence of the violation.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 10 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC Page 271 of 870
D. The processing agency’s final decision shall be in writing and delivered personally to the contestant or the
contestant’s agency or delivered by first class mail within 10 working days following the hearing.
E. If the contestant is not the registered owner of the vehicle, all notices to the contestant required under this
section shall also be given to the registered owner by first class mail.
10.06.150 Collection of unpaid parking penalties.
Except as otherwise provided below, the processing agency shall proceed under subsection (A) or (B) of this
section, but not both, in order to collect an unpaid parking penalty.
A. File an itemization of unpaid parking penalties and other related fees with the Department for collection
pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760 or the successor statute thereto.
B. If more than $400.00 in unpaid parking penalties and other related fees have been accrued by any one
registered owner or the registered owner’s renter, lessee, or sales transferee, proof thereof may be filed with the
court which has the same effect as a civil judgment. Execution may be levied and such other measures may be
taken for the collection of the judgment as are authorized for the collection of unpaid civil judgments entered
against a defendant in an action against a debtor.
The processing agency shall send notice by first class mail to the registered owner or renter, lessee, or sales
transferee indicating that a civil judgment has been filed and the date that the judgment shall become effective.
The notice shall also indicate the time: (1) that execution may be levied against that person’s assets, (2) that
liens may be placed against that person’s property, (3) that the person’s wages may be garnished, and (4) that
other steps may be taken to satisfy the judgment. The notice shall also state that the processing agency will
terminate the commencement of a civil judgment proceeding if all parking penalties and other related fees are
paid prior to the date set for hearing. If judgment is entered, then the City may file a writ of execution or an
abstract wit the court clerk’s office identifying the means by which the civil judgment is to be satisfied.
If a judgment is rendered for the processing agency, that agency may contract with a collection agency licensed
pursuant to Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 6850) of Division 3 of the California Business and Professions
Code to collect the judgment.
The processing agency shall pay the established first paper civil filing fee at the time an entry of civil judgment is
requested.
C. If the registration of the vehicle has not been renewed for 60 days beyond the renewal date and the citation
has not been collected by the Department pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760, or the
successor statute thereto, then the processing agency may file proof of unpaid penalties and fees with the court
which has the same effect as a civil judgment as provided above in subsection (B) of this section.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 10 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC Page 272 of 870
D. The processing agency shall not file a civil judgment with the court relating to a parking citation filed with the
Department unless the processing agency has determined that the registration of the vehicle has not been
renewed for 60 days beyond the renewal date and the citation has not been collected by the Department
pursuant to the California Vehicle Code Section 4760, or the successor statute thereto.

given the copy of the citation information.
2. Determine whether the notice of delinquent parking violation has been filed with Department or if a civil
judgment has been entered pursuant to CMC 10.06.150.

proceedings for that citation shall cease.

Department pursuant to the provisions of the California Vehicle Code, and payment of the parking penalty has
been made, along with any other related fees, then the proceedings for that citation shall cease.
D. If the notice of delinquent parking violation has been filed with the Department and has not been returned by
the Department, and payment of the parking penalty along with any other fees applied by either the Department

hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. Therefore, the presence of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof, on
private or public property, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, constitutes a public nuisance which
may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 516 § 1, 1995).

which does not require his presence. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, by registered mail, at least 10 days

administration or removal of the vehicle, or parts thereof, against the property upon which the vehicle, or parts
thereof, is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such land owner.

and posted on the newsrack, or if no identification is displayed on the newsrack, merely posted on the newsrack.
The notice shall state the violation or violations which constitute the basis of the notice, the City’s intent to

A. Any water consumer shall have the right to demand at least once a year that the meter through which water is
furnished be examined and tested by the Department for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not it is
registering correctly the amount which is being delivered through it to the consumer.
If the meter is found to register one percent or more in excess of the actual quantity passing through it, then an
adjustment as defined in subsection (B) of this section shall be made. If the meter registers less than one
percent in excess of the actual quantity, then the water consumer shall be liable for all costs associated with the
testing. These costs will be determined by Council resolution.
B. If the meter is found to register one percent or more in excess of the actual quantity passing through the
meter, the charge made for water passing through the meter for the current period shall be adjusted by reducing
the bill in accordance with the percentage of such excess.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 13 PUBLIC SERVICES Page 357 of 870
C. Whenever a meter is out of repair such that it fails to register correctly the amount of water passing through it

basis. The percentage of the water reduction shall be applied to the quantity value of the City’s water rate
structure. The rate rationing schedule shall be adopted from time to time by Council resolution. (Ord. 464 § 3,
1991).

comply with the provisions of this Article VII, any other provisions of this code to the contrary notwithstanding.
Charges for reconnection or restoration of service which has been terminated pursuant to this section shall be at
the rates and on the condition set by resolution of the Council for a new water service connection. (Ord. 464 § 3,
1991).

restriction or prohibition specified in this chapter. (Ord. 464 § 3, 1991).
13.04.400 Temporary suspension of service.
A. The City will exercise reasonable diligence to provide continuous and adequate water service to consumers
and to avoid any shortage or interruption of delivery of water, but cannot guarantee complete freedom from
interruption.
B. The City shall have the right to suspend water service temporarily to make necessary repairs or
improvements to the water system.
C. In each case of temporary suspension of service, the City will notify the consumers affected if circumstances
permit and will prosecute the work required to be made by the water system with due diligence and with the least
possible inconvenience to consumers.
13.04.410 City’s right to apportion among consumers.
During any period of threatened or actual water shortage, the City shall have the right to apportion its available
water supply among consumers in such manner as appears most equitable under the circumstances then
prevailing and with due regard to public health and safety.
13.04.420 City not liable for interruption of service.

A. This chapter applies to video service providers holding State franchises to provide video service within the
City of Calistoga under the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 (“DIVCA”), codified in
California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the
definitions contained in DIVCA apply to this chapter. This chapter is intended to supplement, not to duplicate or
contradict, DIVCA and this chapter shall be construed in light of that intent.
B. Pursuant to DIVCA, the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) has the exclusive authority to grant
and administer State franchises for video service. However, DIVCA confers certain rights and responsibilities on
the City with respect to State video franchise holders operating within the City, including but not limited to,
receipt of fees for rent of rights-of-way in the form of a franchise fee and additional fees for support of public,
educational, and governmental (“PEG”) access channels. DIVCA also requires the City to establish and enforce
penalties, consistent with State law, against all State video franchise holders operating within the City for
violations of customer service standards established by State law.
C. Nothing contained in this chapter exempts a State franchise holder from compliance with all ordinances, rules
or regulations of the City now in effect or which may be hereafter adopted which are not inconsistent with this
chapter or DIVCA, or obligations under any franchise previously issued by the City, insofar as those may be
enforced under DIVCA.

D. The rights reserved to the City under this chapter are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether
reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any
other rights which may be held by the City. The City reserves its rights to the lawful exercise of police and other
powers the City now has or may later obtain. Except as otherwise provided by DIVCA, a State franchise shall
not include, or be a substitute for:
1. Compliance with generally applicable requirements for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a
business within the City, including, but not limited to, compliance with the conditions that the City may
establish before facilities may be constructed for, or providing, non-video services;
2. Any permit or authorization, other than a State franchise, required in connection with operations on or in
public rights-of-way or public property, including, but not limited to, encroachment permits, street work
permits, pole attachment permits and street cut permits; and
3. Any permit, agreement or authorization for occupying any other property of the City or any private person
to which access is not specifically granted by the State franchise. (Ord. 715 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).

D. The franchise fee required pursuant to subsection (A) of this section and the PEG fee required pursuant to
subsection (B) of this section shall each be paid to the City quarterly, in a manner consistent with California
Public Utilities Code Section 5860. The State franchise holder shall deliver to the City, by check or other means
specified by the City, a payment for the franchise fee and a separate payment for the PEG fee not later than 45
days after the end of each calendar quarter. Each payment made shall be accompanied by a report detailing how
the payment was calculated, containing such information as the City Manager or his or her designee may
require, consistent with DIVCA.
E. The City shall provide written notification to State franchise holder(s) at such time that the City wishes to
implement the PEG support fee. State franchise holders so notified shall commence payment of the fee to the
City 60 days after City notification of PEG fee implementation. (Ord. 715 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).

business records of a holder of a State franchise to ensure compliance with CMC 13.12.020 in a manner
consistent with California Public Utilities Code Section 5860(i). (Ord. 715 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).

specified in this chapter, the City shall impose a late charge at the rate per year equal to the highest prime
lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus one percent. (Ord. 715 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015).
13.12.050 PEG access channel capacity, interconnection, and signal carriage.
A. PEG Channel Capacity.
1. A State franchisee that has been authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission to provide
video service in the City shall designate and activate three PEG channels within three months from the date
that the City requests that the State franchisee designate and activate these PEG channels. However, this
three-month period shall be tolled for such a period, and only for such a period, during which the State
franchisee’s ability to designate or provide such PEG capacity is technically infeasible, as provided in
Section 5870(a) of the California Public Utilities Code.
2. A State franchisee shall provide an additional PEG channel when the standards set forth in Section
5870(d) of the California Public Utilities Code are satisfied by the City or any entity designated by the City
to manage one or more of the PEG channels.
B. PEG Carriage and Interconnection.
1. State franchisees shall ensure that all PEG channels are receivable by all subscribers, whether they
receive digital or analog service, or a combination thereof, without the need for any equipment other than
that needed to receive the lowest cost tier of service. PEG access capacity provided by a State franchisee
shall be of similar quality and functionality to that offered by commercial channels (unless the PEG signal is
provided to the State franchisee at a lower quality or with less functionality), shall be capable of carrying a
National Television System Committee (NTSC) quality television signal, and shall be carried on the State
franchisee’s lowest cost tier of service. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated
numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers for the
PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited
by federal law. After the initial designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be
changed without the agreement of the City unless federal law requires the change.
2. The holder of a State franchise and an incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to
interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG programming. If a State franchisee and an
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 13 PUBLIC SERVICES Page 398 of 870
incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement for PEG carriage,
the City shall require the incumbent cable operator to allow the State franchisee to interconnect its network
with the incumbent cable operator’s network at a technically feasible point on the State franchisee’s
network as identified by the State franchisee. If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available,
the State franchisee shall make interconnection available to the PEG channel originator and shall provide
the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the State
franchisee requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. (Ord. 715 § 1 (Exh. A),
2015).
13.12.060 Customer service penalties.
A. Any holder of a State franchise shall comply with all applicable State and federal customer service and
protection standards pertaining to the provision of video service.
B. The City will provide any holder of a State franchise written notice of any material breach of applicable
customer service and protection standards, and will allow the franchise holder at least 30 calendar days from the
receipt of the notice to remedy the specified material breach. A material breach that is not remedied by the State
franchise holder within the remedy period shall subject the State franchise holder to the following penalties to be
imposed by the City:
1. For the first occurrence of a material breach, a penalty of not more than $500.00 for each day of each material
breach, not to exceed $1,500 for each occurrence of a material breach.
2. For the second violation of the same nature within 12 months, a penalty of $1,000 for each day of each
material breach, not to exceed $3,000 for each occurrence of the material breach.
3. For a third or further violation of the same nature within 12 months, a penalty of $2,500 for each day of each
material breach, not to exceed $7,500 for each occurrence of the material breach.
C. Any notice and any penalty may be issued or imposed by the City Manager, or the City Manager’s designee.
Any notice shall be in writing. Notices shall be transmitted by United States Postal Service certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or by private commercial delivery or courier service for
same day or next business day delivery with delivery and receipt signature required.
D. The State franchise holder may appeal any finding of material breach or imposition of penalties to the City
Council. Any appeal must be made within 30 calendar days of receipt by the State franchise holder of the finding
of material breach or the imposition of penalties, and must be submitted in writing to the City Clerk and the City
Manager in order to be placed on a City Council agenda for consideration. Any appeal must contain a detailed
explanation of why the appellant believes that the finding of material breach or the imposition of penalties is
inconsistent with statutory requirements.

incorporate into its network the capability to permit the City to override the audio portion of all channels
simultaneously in times of emergency. In addition, each State franchise holder may be required to designate a
channel, which may be a PEG channel, to be used for audio and video emergency broadcasts. The State

15.46.010 Purpose, scope and application.
A. Purpose. Calistoga has experienced and will continue to experience moderate to great earthquakes due to its
proximity to numerous active and potentially active faults. Many commercial buildings are a serious threat to the
life and safety of people who live and work in the community in the event of an earthquake. The primary goal of
this chapter is to reduce the risk of death and injury resulting from damage to existing unreinforced masonry
buildings from earthquakes in an economically feasible manner.
This chapter provides procedures for the systematic review and upgrading of unreinforced masonry and
concrete buildings within the City to reduce the risk of death and injury in the event of an earthquake.
B. Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings with unreinforced masonry walls designed
under building codes in effect prior to the effective date of this chapter.
Any such buildings with seismic strengthening in place prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter shall be within the scope of this chapter and shall, therefore, be evaluated according to the provisions of
this chapter and modified to comply with this chapter if deficient.
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to
reduce the risk of life loss or injury on both subject and adjacent properties and will not necessarily prevent loss
of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing building that complies with these standards. The
requirement for compliance with these standards does not preclude the utilization, at the building owner’s option,
of more extensive strengthening method that might further prevent or limit loss of life or injury or building

1. The housing development project would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety
unless the project is disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a lower
density.
2. There is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the adverse impact identified other than
disapproval of the housing development project or approval upon condition that the project be developed at
a lower density.
C. In approving or in conditionally approving a tentative map for the conversion of a mobile home park to another
use pursuant to Government Code Section 66427.4, the Planning Commission shall be required to:
1. Take steps to mitigate any significant adverse impact of the conversion on the ability of displaced mobile
home park residents to find adequate space in a similarly developed mobile home park or other suitable
replacement housing;
2. Find that there already exists land zoned for replacement housing or adequate space in other mobile
home parks for those residents who will be displaced;
3. Require the subdivider to take steps to mitigate any significant adverse impacts of the conversion on the
ability of the displaced mobile home park residents to find adequate space in a mobile home park or other
suitable housing; or
4. Make a finding, based upon substantial evidence, that mitigation pursuant to subsections (C)(1) and
(C)(3) of this section is not feasible. As used herein, “feasible” shall mean capable of being accomplished
in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental,
social and technological factors.

D. The Planning Commission may deny a tentative map on any grounds provided by law including, without
limitation, a finding that the discharge of waste from the proposed subdivision into an existing community sewer
system would result in, or add to, violation of existing requirements prescribed by a State Regional Water
Quality Control Board. A tentative map shall be denied if any of the following findings are made:
1. That the proposed map is not consistent with the General Plan, applicable specific plans, or other
applicable provisions of this code;
2. That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with the General Plan,
applicable specific plans, or other applicable provisions of this code;
3. That the site is not physically suitable for the type and/or density of development;
4. That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial
environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Planning Commission may approve such a tentative map if an environmental impact
report was prepared with respect to the project and a finding was made pursuant to Section 21081(c) of
CEQA that specific economic, social or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or
project alternatives identified in the environmental impact report;
5. That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements are likely to cause serious public health
problems;
6. That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements of record or
easements established by court judgment, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of
property within the proposed subdivision;
7. That all requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act and the rules and procedures adopted
by the Council pursuant thereto have not been met;
8. That the applicant has failed to submit complete or adequate information; or
9. Subject to Government Code Section 66474.4 that the land is subject to a contract entered into pursuant
to the California Land Conservation Act of 1965 (commencing with Section 51200 of the Government Code)
and that the resulting parcels following a subdivision of the land would be too small to sustain their
agricultural use.
16.10.050 Extensions of time limits.
A. Any applicable time limits for acting on a tentative map may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider
and Planning Commission or Council. A waiver of applicable time limits may be required of the subdivider to
permit concurrent processing of related project approvals or environmental review on the same project.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 489 of 870
B. Prior to the expiration date, the subdivider may apply in writing for an extension of time. Each application shall
be made at least 30 days before expiration, but in no case shall said request be made sooner than 60 days prior
to the expiration. All requests for extensions shall be accompanied by a fee as established by Council resolution.
C. Once an application for extension is timely filed, the map shall be automatically extended as provided in
Government Code Section 66452.6(e).
D. An extension of time may be granted if the Planning Commission finds the subdivision, at the time the
application for the extension of time is heard, conforms to the then-existing General Plan, is consistent with the
zoning of the parcels and conforms to the improvement standards that are being imposed upon similar new
subdivisions. The Planning Commission may condition its approval by subjecting the subdivider to any increase
in applicable development fees or to new development fees which have occurred since the approval of the map.
The Planning Commission may extend the date on which the map expires up to 36 additional months and/or
increments up to 36 months.
E. Approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in accordance
with Government Code Section 66498.1. Such rights shall expire one year following the recordation of the final
map. Where multiple final maps are recorded on various designated approved phases of a project covered by a
single vesting tentative map, the time limit set forth herein shall begin for each phase when the final map for that
phase is recorded. In accordance with Section 66452.6(g) of the State Subdivision Map Act, a subdivider may
apply for a one-year extension of the initial time period in accordance with subsection (B) of this section.
16.10.060 Expiration.
A. An approved or conditionally approved tentative map or vesting tentative map shall expire 24 months after its
approval or conditional approval unless an extension is approved as provided in CMC 16.10.060. However, if a
subdivider who is filing multiple final maps is made subject to a requirement to construct, improve or finance the
construction or improvement of certain public improvements outside the boundaries of the tentative map, as set
forth in Government Code 66452.6, or if the tentative map is on property subject to a development agreement
authorized by Government Code Sections 65864 et seq., then the expiration date shall be extended in
accordance with Government Code Section 66452.6(a). An extension to the expiration date may also be
approved as provided in CMC 16.10.080.
B. The period of time specified in subsection (A) of this section shall not include any period of time during which
a development moratorium is in effect as provided in Government Code Section 66452.6.
C. The period of time specified in subsection (A) of this section shall not include any period of time during which
a lawsuit has been filed and is pending in a court of competent jurisdiction involving the approval or conditional
approval of a tentative map only if a stay of the time period is approved by the Planning Commission, as
provided in Government Code Section 66452.6.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.

D. The expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall terminate all proceedings, and no
final map on all or any portion of the real property included within an expired tentative map shall be filed without
first processing a new tentative map.
16.10.070 Survey required.
An accurate and complete survey of the land to be subdivided shall be made by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor and be approved by the City Engineer prior to approval of a final map or parcel map. The
survey shall conform to the information requirements and standards of the Subdivision Map Act.
16.10.080 Final maps and parcel maps.
A. The City Engineer shall review the preliminary final map and any other required information and the subdivider
shall make corrections and/or additions until acceptable to the City Engineer.
B. The Council shall consider the final map for approval at its next regular meeting after the City Clerk receives
the map. Before approving the final map, the Council shall consider approval of the subdivision improvement
agreement in accordance with the requirements of CMC 16.18.070.
C. The Council shall approve the final map if the Council finds that the map meets all the requirements and
conditions imposed by the State Subdivision Map Act and by this title, which were applicable to the subdivision
at the time of the approval of the tentative map. If the subdivision improvement agreement and/or final map is
unacceptable, the Council shall make its recommended corrections, instruct the Director of Public Works and
Director of Planning and Building to return the map to the subdivider to revise the agreement and/or revise the
final map and defer approval until an acceptable agreement and/or final map has been resubmitted.
D. If the subdivision improvement agreement and final map are approved by the Council, it shall instruct the City
Clerk to execute the agreement on behalf of the City. At the time the Council approves the final map, it shall also
accept, accept subject to improvement, or reject any offer of dedication.
E. The City Clerk shall certify on the final map the action by the Council. If at the time the final map is approved,
any streets, paths, alleys, public utility easements, rights-of-way for local transit facilities or storm drainage
easements are not accepted by the Council, the offer of dedication shall remain open and the Council may, by
resolution at any later date, and without further action by the subdivider, rescind its action and accept and open
the streets, paths, alleys, rights-of-way for local transit facilities or storm drainage easements which acceptance
shall be recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
F. The Council may accept by resolution any dedications lying outside the subdivision boundary which require a
separate grant deed. The acceptance shall be shown on the grant deed with reference to the resolution before
the grant deed is recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
G. The Council shall not postpone or refuse approval of a final map because the subdivider has failed to meet a
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 491 of 870
tentative map condition requiring construction or installation of off-site improvements on land which neither the
subdivider nor the City has sufficient title or interest to permit the improvements to be made. In such a case, the
City shall follow the procedure according to Government Code Section 66462.5.
H. The subdivider shall submit to the Director of Public Works the original tracing of the map and any duplicates
per county requirements, corrected to its final form and signed by all parties required to execute the certificates
on the map. Original signatures shall appear on the original drawing. Upon receipt of all required certificates and
submittals, the Director of Public Works shall sign the appropriate certificates and transmit the original map to
the City Clerk. The date the map shall be deemed filed with the Council is the date on which the City Clerk
receives the map.
16.10.090 Phasing.
Multiple final maps relating to an approved or conditionally approved tentative map may be filed prior to the
expiration of the tentative map if the subdivider, at the time the tentative map application is filed, notifies the
Director of Planning and Building in writing of the subdivider’s intention to file multiple final maps on the tentative
map in accordance with Government Code Section 66456.1. In providing the notice, the subdivider shall define
the number or configuration of the proposed multiple maps. The Planning Commission shall approve the
sequence of map approvals. After filing of the tentative map application, the Director of Planning and Building,
the Director of Public Works and the subdivider shall concur in the filing of multiple final maps.
The filing of a final map on a portion of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall not invalidate
any part of the tentative map. Each final map which constitutes a part, or unit, of the approved or conditionally
approved tentative map shall have a separate subdivision number. The subdivision improvement agreement
executed by the subdivider shall provide for the construction of improvements as required to constitute a logical
and orderly development of the whole subdivision.
16.10.100 Filing with the County Recorder.
Upon approval of the final map by the Council and receipt thereof from the Director of Public Works, the City
Clerk shall execute the appropriate certificate on the certificate sheet and shall, subject to the provisions of
Government Code Section 66464, transmit the map.

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 496 of 870
16.14.050 Dedication of solar easements.
A. As a condition of approval of a tentative map or tentative parcel map, there may be imposed, in accordance
with the provisions of Section 66475.3 of the State Subdivision Map Act, a requirement that the subdivider
dedicate easements for the purpose of assuring that each parcel or unit in the subdivision shall have the right to
receive sunlight across adjacent parcels or units in the subdivision for any solar energy system, as defined in
Section 801.5 of the California Civil Code. In establishing such easements, consideration shall be given to
feasibility, contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided and cost. Required easements shall not result in
reducing allowable densities or the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building or a structure under
applicable planning and zoning in force at the time such tentative map or tentative parcel map is filed.
B. At the time of tentative map or tentative parcel map approval, the Planning Commission shall specify the
following:
1. The standards for determining the exact dimensions and locations of such easements.
2. Any restrictions on vegetation, buildings and other objects which would obstruct the passage of sunlight
through the easement.

A subdivider shall be required to dedicate easements to provide public access to or along the shore lines of
public natural resources, including a public waterway, river or stream, lake or reservoir, in accordance with the
criteria set forth in Government Code Sections 66478.4 through 66478.14.
16.14.070 Reservations.
A. As a condition of approval of a tentative map or tentative parcel map, the Planning Commission or Council
may require the subdivider to reserve sites, appropriate in area and location, for parks, recreational facilities, fire
stations, libraries or other public uses according to the standards and formula contained in this section.
B. Where a park, recreational facility, fire station, library, or other public use is shown on any applicable specific
plan or the General Plan the subdivider may be required by the City to reserve sites as so determined by the
City in accordance with the principles and standards contained in the plans or implementing laws. The reserved
area must be of such size and shape as to permit the balance of the property within which the reservation is
located to develop in an orderly and efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make
development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible. The reserved area shall
conform to the plans and shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit an efficient division of the
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 497 of 870
reserved area in the event that it is not acquired within the prescribed period.
C. The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall, at the time of approval of the final or
parcel map, enter into a binding agreement to acquire such reserved area within two years after the completion
and acceptance of all improvements unless such period of time is extended by mutual agreement.
D. The purchase price shall be the market value thereof at the time of the filing of the tentative map or tentative
parcel map plus the taxes against such reserved area from the date of the reservation and any other costs
incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance of such reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any
loan covering such reserved area.
E. If the public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved does not enter into such a binding
agreement, the reservation of such area shall automatically terminate.
16.14.080 Bridge crossing and major thoroughfares fees.
A. The purpose of this section is to make provision for assessing and collecting fees as a condition of approval
of a parcel or final map or as a condition of issuing a building permit for the purposes of defraying the actual or
estimated costs of constructing bridges or major thoroughfares pursuant to Section 66484 of the State
Subdivision Map Act.
B. Whenever the following words are used in this section, they shall have the following meaning:
1. “Construction” shall mean design, acquisition of right-of-way, administration of construction contracts
and actual construction.
2. “Major thoroughfare” shall mean a roadway as shown on the circulation element of the General Plan
whose primary purpose is to carry through traffic and provide a circulation network for the City.
C. Prior to filing a parcel or final map which includes land within an area of benefit established pursuant to this
section, the subdivider shall pay or cause to be paid any fees established and apportioned to the property
pursuant to this section for the purpose of defraying the actual or estimated cost of constructing bridges or major
thoroughfares.
D. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for construction on any property within an area of benefit established
pursuant to this section, the applicant for such permit shall pay or cause to be paid any fees established and
apportioned pursuant to this section for the purpose of defraying the actual or estimated cost of constructing
bridges over waterways or constructing major thoroughfares, unless such fees have been paid pursuant to
subsection (C) of this section.
E. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (C) and (D) of this section:
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 498 of 870
1. Payment of bridge fees shall not be required unless the planned bridge facility is an original bridge
serving the area or an addition to any existing bridge facility serving the area at the time of adoption of the
boundaries of the area of benefit.
2. Payment of major thoroughfare fees shall not be required unless the major thoroughfares are in addition
to, or a reconstruction of, any existing major thoroughfares serving the area at the time of the adoption of
the area of benefit.
F. Prior to establishing an area of benefit, a public hearing shall be held by the Council, at which time the
boundaries of the area of benefit, the costs, whether actual or estimated, and a fair method of allocation of costs
to the area of benefit and fee apportionment, and the fee to be collected, shall be established. The notice of such
hearing shall contain preliminary information related to the boundaries of the area of benefit, estimated cost and
the method of fee apportionment.
G. At any time not later than the hour set for hearing objections to the proposed bridge facility or major
thoroughfare, any owner of property to be benefitted by the improvement may file a written protest against the
proposed bridge facility or major thoroughfare or against the extent of the area to be benefitted by the
improvements or against both of them. Such protest must be in writing and must contain a description of the
property in which each signer thereof is interested, sufficient to identify the same and if the signers are not
shown on the last equalized assessment roll as the owners of such property, must contain or be accompanied
by written evidence that such signers are the owners of such property. All such protest shall be delivered to the
City Clerk and no other protest or objections shall be considered. Any protests may be withdrawn by the owner’s
making the same, in writing, at any time prior to the conclusion of the public hearing.
H. If there is a written protest filed with the City Clerk by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the
property to be benefitted by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area
represented to less than one-half of that to be benefitted, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned,
and the Council shall not, for one year from the filing of that written protest, commence or carry on any
proceedings for the same improvements under the provision of this section. If any majority protest is directed
against only a portion of the improvement then all further proceedings under the provisions of this section to
construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year, but the
Council may commence new proceedings not including any part of the improvement or acquisition so protested
against. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Council within such one-year period, from commencing and
carrying on new proceedings for the construction of a portion of the improvement so protested against if it finds,
by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of more than one-half of the area of the
property to be benefitted are in favor of going forward with such portion of the improvement or acquisition.
I. If the Council finds that a majority protest has not been made, they shall make the determinations required by
subsection (F) of this section and decide whether or not to confirm the area of benefit. The Council shall
announce its decision by resolution, which shall be recorded with the office of the County Recorder. There are

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 499 of 870
hereby established fees for the purposes of defraying the actual or estimated cost of constructing the bridge or
thoroughfare as described in such resolution as the Council may adopt pursuant to this section. The fees and the
area of benefit to which such fees are apportioned shall be established as set forth in the resolution. Such
apportioned fees shall be applicable to all property within the area of benefit and shall be payable as condition of
approval of a parcel or final map or as a condition of issuing a building permit for such property or portions
thereof.
J. Notwithstanding the provision of subsection (I) of this section, payment of such fees shall not be required for:
1. The use, alteration or enlargement of an existing building or structure or the erection of one or more
buildings or structures accessory thereto, or both, on the same lot or parcel of land. However, the total
value, as determined by the Director of Planning and Building, of all such alteration, enlargement or
construction completed within any one-year period shall not exceed one-half of the current market value, as
determined by the Director of Planning and Building, of all existing building on such lot or parcel of land, and
the alteration or enlargement of the building shall not change its classification of occupancy as defined by
Section 501 of the Uniform Building Code.
2. The following accessory buildings and structures: private garages, children’s playhouses, radio and
television receiving antennas, windmills, silos, tank houses, shops, barns, coops and other buildings which
are accessory to one-family or two-family dwellings.
K. Upon application by the subdivider or applicant for a parcel or final map or a building permit, the Planning
Commission may recommend to the Council to accept a substitution or consideration in lieu of fees required
pursuant to this section, provided:
1. The Council finds upon recommendation of the Director of Public Works the substitute consideration has
a value equal to or greater than the fee; and
2. The substitute consideration is in a form acceptable to the Council.
16.14.090 Storm drainage and sanitary sewer fees.
The Council may impose fees authorized by Sections 66483 et seq. of the State Subdivision Map Act by
adopting an ordinance in conformance with the requirements set forth therein.
16.14.100 Supplemental improvement capacity.
A. As a condition of approval of a tentative map or a tentative parcel map, there may be imposed a requirement
that improvements installed by the subdivider for the benefit of the subdivision contain supplemental size,
capacity, number or length for the benefit of property not within the subdivision and that those improvements be
dedicated to the public. However, when such supplemental size, capacity, number or length is solely for the
benefit of property not within the subdivision, the City shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 66486 and
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 500 of 870
66487 of the State Subdivision Map Act, enter into an agreement with the subdivider to reimburse the subdivider
for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost
the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such
improvements.
B. The Council shall determine the method for payment of the costs required by a reimbursement agreement,
which method may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
1. The collection from other persons, including public agencies, using such improvements for the benefit of
real property not within the subdivision, a reasonable charge for such use.
2. The contribution to the subdivider of that part of the cost of the improvements that is attributable to the
benefit of real property outside the subdivision and the levy of a charge upon the real property benefitted to
reimburse the City for such costs, together with interest thereon, if any, paid to the subdivider.
3. The establishment and maintenance of local benefit districts for the levy and collection of such charge or
costs from the property benefitted.
C. No charge, area of benefit or local benefit district shall be established unless and until a public hearing is
noticed and held thereon by the Council and the Council finds that the charge, area of benefit or local benefit
district is reasonably related to the cost of such supplemental improvements and the actual ultimate
beneficiaries thereof.
D. In addition to the notice required by CMC 16.14.080(F), written notice of the hearing shall be given to those
who own property within the proposed area of benefit as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, and the
potential users of the supplemental improvements insofar as they be ascertained at the time. Such notices shall
be mailed by the City Clerk at least 10 days prior to the date established for the hearing.
16.14.110 Interim public school classroom facilities.
The City may require a subdivider to dedicate land or pay fees instead, or a combination of both, for interim
classroom and related facilities for elementary or high schools to alleviate conditions of overcrowding caused by
new residential development, in conformance with Government Code Sections 65970 through 65980.

requirements identified in the environmental document adopted for the project in any plan prepared for the
subdivision pursuant to the conservation and safety and floodplain regulations of this code.
C. Deed restrictions when required shall run with the land and be enforceable by subsequent owners of property
lying within the subdivision. When deemed necessary to effectuate conditions on approved maps, the City shall
be named a third party beneficiary of those restrictions and the restrictions shall be filed concurrently with the
map and noticed in the owner’s certificate.
D. To the extent legally feasible, the subdivider shall assure long-term maintenance of the improvements not
accepted by the City or other public entity by use of a homeowner’s association, maintenance agreement,
participation in established maintenance district, or other similarly enforceable vehicle approved by the City

number of intersections.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 503 of 870
16.16.030 Circulation and traffic.
A. The subdivision shall be consistent in concept, alignment and level of improvement with the circulation
element of the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan, as well as any street connection policy. Where
necessary to ensure traffic safety and ease of circulation, off- and on-site traffic-control devices and
improvements, such as signing, striping, signalization, traffic islands, channelization, access limits and
provisions, turn lanes, etc. shall be required. On-site parking shall be required to meet the minimum zoning
regulations.
B. Satisfactory access to the subdivision and to each lot shall be provided by public streets meeting all
applicable standard specifications. Subdivisions with streets longer than 500 feet shall be required to provide
multiple access. Access shall be deemed satisfactory only if it will allow reasonable ingress and egress for
emergency vehicles. In the event a public street is not necessary for future street connections, a private street
may be permitted upon a finding by the Planning Commission or Council that a private street is justified because
of the topography or other natural features of the land or because of limitations imposed by adjacent developed
property. In such case the subdivider shall be required to provide a feasible method for maintenance of, and
parking enforcement on, such private street(s), which shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Public
Works and City Attorney.
C. All streets shall be designed and constructed to ensure the public health, safety and welfare, and to meet the
relevant standards set forth in the Public Works and Fire Department specifications, and CalTrans standard
specifications, and applicable City of Santa Rosa specifications. In addition:
1. Where a subdivision abuts upon a street or highway of importance, the Director of Public Works may
require parallel service roads and may limit the right of access to the street or highways.
2. The frontage of each lot shall be improved to its ultimate geometric section to the centerline of the street,
including street structure section, curbs, sidewalks, driveway approaches and transitions. Where
necessary to provide adequate circulation and safety, two-way traffic flow shall be provided by sufficient
pavement construction beyond the centerline of the street a minimum distance of 12 feet past centerline.
3. All streets shall, as far as practicable, be in alignment with existing and adjacent streets by continuation
of centerlines, or by adjustment by curves, and shall be in general conformity with the plans made for the
most advantageous development of the area in which the subdivision lies. Streets shall be required to
intersect one another at an angle as near to a right angle as is practicable in each specific case. Where a
street joins acreage, provision may be required for adequate street access thereto.
4. In cases where rural conditions exist upon recommendation of the Public Works and Planning and
Building Directors the Planning Commission may approve modifications to street design and/or construction
materials.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 504 of 870
D. Pedestrian, equestrian and bike paths may be required to provide access to schools, parks, rivers and other

Works. Upon recommendation of the Public Works and Planning and Building Directors, vintage street fixtures
may be used.
H. Driveways shall be designed and improved in such a way as to preserve the public health, safety and welfare
considering such factors as terrain, grade lengths, etc.
I. Bridges shall be designed and constructed to meet the weight and width requirements of the Public Works and
Fire Department standards, and applicable CalTrans standards.
16.16.040 Drainage.
A. Storm water runoff from the subdivision shall be collected and conveyed by an approved storm drainage
system. The storm drainage system shall be designed by a registered civil engineer for ultimate development of
the watershed and shall be capable of collecting and conveying runoff generated by a 100-year storm. The
system shall provide for the protection of abutting and off-site properties that may be adversely affected by any
increase in runoff attributed to the development; off-site storm drain improvements may be required to satisfy
this requirement. In addition, retention ponds, drainage swales and/or check dams may be required to reduce offsite
peak storm flow generated by projects to the historic flow.
B. Improvements shall be designed to meet the public works standard specifications. Drainage improvements for
runoff shall be engineered to minimize erosion through the use of rocked culvert inlets and outfalls, energy
reducers, the correct location of culverts, etc. Design features shall include reseeding exposed slopes as well as
minimizing the use of artificial slopes. Improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the approved plans
and specifications.
16.16.050 Grading.
A. Development shall maximize retention of natural land forms such as rolling hills, ridgetops, areas of extensive
vegetation and water courses. Grading shall not produce large flat planes or sharp angles at the intersection with
the natural terrain. Slopes shall be rounded to blend with existing terrain. Specific grading criteria in Chapter
19.08 CMC shall apply.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 505 of 870
B. Grading plans shall be required for all subdivisions. When necessary, the plan shall provide for both on and
off-site grading and shall be submitted as part of the subdivision’s improvement plan. No grading shall be
commenced until the tentative map or tentative parcel map has been approved and a grading permit is issued.
Issuance of building permits or release of security for improvement agreements may be conditioned upon receipt
of approved written assurance by a registered civil engineer that the lot grading and building pad elevations have
been done in conformance with the approved plan and/or geotechnical requirements.
16.16.060 Landscaping.
A landscaping plan may be required for subdivisions and shall be required for common or dedicated open space
and where necessary to prevent erosion or to replace vegetation lost during construction. In all subdivisions,
existing trees shall be preserved where feasible. In accordance with provisions of Chapter 19.01 CMC, trees
shall be required.
16.16.070 Energy conservation.
The design of the subdivision shall provide, in accordance with Section 66473.1 of the State Subdivision Map Act
and to the extent feasible, for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities.
16.16.080 Fire protection.
A. Each subdivision shall provide all necessary protective measures and facilities, such as fire hydrants, and
shall be designed in accordance with the City’s Standard Specifications and the Board of Fire Underwriters. Type
and location of fire hydrants shall be as specified by the Fire Chief and Director of Public Works.
B. Commercial subdivisions shall provide sufficient water capacity, flow and storage to ensure the protection of
the public health, safety and welfare.
16.16.090 Underground utilities.
A. All existing and proposed utilities within the subdivision, including, but not limited to electric, communication
and cable television lines shall be placed underground except:
1. Facilities exempted by the Public Utilities Commission;
2. Metal poles supporting only street lights;
3. Surface mounted transformer, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets and concealed
ducts, in commercial or industrial subdivisions only;
4. Upon approval of the Director of Public Works, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and/or surface mounted
transformers may be approved in residential subdivisions.
For the purpose of this section, the subdivision boundary shall be considered to be the centerline of the street or
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 506 of 870
streets adjacent to the subdivision.
B. No additional poles shall be installed outside of the subdivision in order to comply with this section unless
specifically approved by the Director of Public Works. This may require undergrounding to the nearest existing
poles beyond the subdivision boundaries and/or undergrounding, with the owner’s approval, of existing overhead
services to properties on the opposite side of the street.
C. The Council may waive the undergrounding requirement for existing overhead transmission and distribution
lines for tentative maps and tentative parcel maps upon finding that:
1. The length of the required undergrounding of existing overhead facilities on peripheral streets is less than
200 feet; and
2. It is unlikely that additional undergrounding will occur on adjacent properties within 10 years because of
the development presently existing on adjacent properties; and
3. The visual burden of leaving the utilities above ground will be insignificant.
As a condition of such waiver, the City may require that conduits for future undergrounding be included within
designated streets within the subdivision. The waiver shall not apply to services to the subdivided property.
D. Connections for all utility lines placed under streets shall be extended to the right-of-way line and their
location shall be marked upon the curb or sidewalk. All such lines shall be installed prior to final street paving.
16.16.100 Scenic areas.
In areas such as ridges, hilltops, properties zoned RR-H (rural residential:hillside), and other scenic areas,
development shall ensure adequate mitigation for protection and/or preservation of the scenic resources.
Development shall be encouraged to use the form of the land and vegetation to ensure separation of building
areas and minimal exposure from roads or other building areas. The use of plantings, generally trees, consistent
and compatible with those of the area may be required to mitigate the extent of exposure of the development
area in conjunction with land forms, existing vegetation and other features. Screening required for shielding of
development areas, not necessarily the immediate house site, shall consist of natural materials of the area,
preferably using natural vegetation or land form modification to conform to the natural terrain. In addition the
provisions of Chapter 19.08 CMC are applicable.
16.16.110 Resource areas.
Subdivisions affecting resources described in the General Plan, any applicable specific plan, or the zoning
ordinance, shall be subject to the following requirements:
A. Design of projects shall recognize the environmental resource characteristics of the site and be designed in
such a manner to allow for the preservation and continued production of the particular resource.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 507 of 870
B. Development shall not adversely affect the natural course of riparian habitat of any intermittent, seasonal, or
permanent waterway. Mitigation measures shall be required where development may result in impacts to such
areas.
C. Development shall not adversely affect the Napa River and tributary streams. Impact upon these areas by a
project shall be mitigated.
D. Development shall not adversely affect areas identified as significant wildlife habitat, and impacts upon these
areas by a project shall be mitigated.
E. Extensive changes or removal of vegetation shall demonstrate minimal adverse impacts on microclimate
conditions. Erosion protection and vegetation shall be required in the event of vegetation removal.
F. Whenever significant archaeological or paleontological sites may be located within the project area, an
appropriate survey by qualified archaeologists shall be made and mitigation measures implemented prior to
development of the site.
G. Development shall not adversely affect the existing volume of any body of water, substantially increase
chemical or nutrient pollution, or otherwise contribute to the deterioration of the quality and quantity of water in
any body or water.
H. Where any of the proposed lots adjoins an agricultural pursuit, the City may require an increased building
setback line for those lots to protect the agricultural operation and/or residential neighbors.
I. Development shall not adversely affect any historic site located within the proposed development and impacts
shall be mitigated.
J. A resource management/restoration plan may be required and suggested measures implemented.
16.16.120 City water supply.
A. All new subdivisions shall be required to connect to the City water system unless an exception is granted
pursuant to the provisions of CMC 13.04.170. If an “auxiliary water supply” will also be used, backflow
prevention devices shall be installed to isolate the auxiliary supply from the City’s supply. Water service shall be
brought to the property line of each lot being served and for residential lots shall be no more than one-inch
service. Commercial and industrial services shall be no more than two inches for domestic use and six inches
for fire protection, unless alternative installation measures are approved by the Director of Public Works. A
minimum 15-foot wide waterline easement is required for all water facilities outside the public street right-of-way.
B. In the event there is inadequate pressure to serve the subdivision, the subdivider shall install those facilities
required to ensure adequate pressure including, without limitation, pumps, water tanks, hydropneumatic tanks, or
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 508 of 870
other approved equipment.
C. All water mains shall be of C900 PVC CL200 or Ductile Ironpipe CL200 and shall be no less than eight-inch
diameter. The Public Works Department may permit six-inch diameter mains in areas where fire hydrants are
not required and the water main will not be extended for future use. (Ord. 539 § 7, 1998).
16.16.130 Sewage disposal.
A. All new subdivisions shall be required to connect to the City’s sanitary sewer system, except for single-family
residential subdivisions on property designated on the General Plan Land Use Map Rural Residential when
granted an exception pursuant to subsection (B) of this section. Such subdivisions may utilize a septic disposal
system; provided, that the minimum parcel size is two acres and the overall density is not greater than 0.5
dwelling units per acre (one unit per two acres).
B. Exceptions. Owners of property designated on the General Plan Rural Residential (including all overlays)
proposing to subdivide said property may petition the Council for an exception to the requirement to connect to
the City’s sanitary sewer facilities; provided, that the proposed minimum parcel size is two acres and the overall
density is not greater than 0.5 dwelling units per acre (one unit per two acres).
1. The following procedures shall be followed for the consideration of petitions for an exception to the
requirements of this section:

c. The likelihood of adjoining property(ies) to develop and the need for the extension of public sewer
facilities to accommodate such development;
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 16 SUBDIVISIONS Page 509 of 870
d. The potential environmental effects resulting from the installation of public facilities given the
physical conditions and improvements present at the property including, but not limited to: slope, soil
conditions, tree cover, existing features and structures, etc., which might present constraints to the
extension of public sewer facilities;
e. The physical conditions and improvements present at the property including, but not limited to:
slope, soil conditions, tree cover, existing features and structures, etc., which might present significant
ongoing costs for maintenance of the public facilities;
f. The ability to provide public service to the frontage of the adjoining property(ies);
g. The adequacy of the proposed private system to satisfy the requirements of the Napa County
Environmental Health Department.
3. Granting of an exception by the City Council shall not have the effect of limiting the City’s rights to
further condition the approval of the proposed subdivision. Said conditions or requirements may include but
shall not be limited to the following:
a. The property owner requesting the exception shall design and install the public sewer main across
the frontage of the subject property including the extension, if any, of the public facilities from the
existing closest point. Appropriate dedication of right-of-way shall be made to accommodate said
installation. Said design, installation and dedication shall occur prior to the occupancy of the new
development and shall not be subject to reimbursement or other credit by the City of Calistoga. An
agreement for reimbursement from private development may be executed.
b. In the event the property owner does not wish to extend the public sewer main prior to occupancy of
the new development, the property owner requesting the exception shall enter into an improvement
agreement with the City, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney, to require the design and installation
of the public sewer main extension within a reasonable time period of a finding by the City that the
public sewer main extension is necessary to support area development. The agreement shall include
surety adequate to cover design and construction costs, and shall include a provision for surety
increase to cover future design and construction cost inflation.
c. A home owners association (HOA) or other entity or binding agreement, acceptable to the City
Attorney, shall be created and maintained in perpetuity to ensure the long-term maintenance of the
common and/or private facilities (septic systems, sewer lines, etc.). The HOA shall maintain a
sufficient fund reserve as determined by the Director of Public Works at all times to ensure that
maintenance of the private facilities will occur as necessary. Duties and obligations of the HOA shall
be stipulated in covenants, codes and restrictions (CC&Rs) which shall govern the private property.

the City Attorney and shall be recorded prior to occupancy of any new development of the subject
property.
All private sewer systems are subject to the approval of the County Department of Environmental Health. Prior
to City approval of any subdivision proposing to utilize a private sewer disposal system, a letter shall be
submitted by the Health Officer stating findings and setting forth recommendations on the ultimate subdivision
layout. (Ord. 619 § 2, 2005).
16.16.140 Minimum subdivision elevation.
No residential lot may be created by subdivision which will be subject to periodic inundation or overflow from
storm drainage or flood waters. The building floor elevations shall be not less than the minimum building floor
elevation established by the floodplain regulations of the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA).
The Director of Public Works may require that the top of the curb elevations be designed so as to ensure
adequate evacuation of persons by automobile in the event of a 100-year flood. All elevations shall be referenced
to the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey or to elevations established by the Director of Public Works.
16.16.150 Fencing.
Each parcel or lot within the subdivision that is adjacent to property containing a public facility shall have an
approved fence adequate to prevent unauthorized access between the properties. A fence of adequate height

B. The City shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has
been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of the State Subdivision Map
Act or this title if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or the public
safety. The authority to deny such a permit or approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner
of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is either the current owner of record or a
vendee thereof with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of
an interest in such real property.
C. If the City issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any real property illegally subdivided, the
City may impose those additional conditions which would have been applicable to the division of the property at
the time the current owner of record acquired the property. If the property has the same owner of record as at
the time of the initial violation, the City may impose conditions applicable to a current division of the property. If
a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record in accordance with the provisions of CMC

with the provisions of this title or State Subdivision Map Act, or wish to refer the decision to the Planning
Commission, the Director of Planning and Building shall set the issue before the Planning Commission. If a
determination of compliance is made, the Planning Commission shall cause a certificate of compliance to be
filed with the County Recorder. If the Planning Commission determines that such real property does not comply

Commission making such a determination and establishing such conditions, the Director of Planning and Building
shall issue a conditional certificate of compliance which shall be filed with the County Recorder. Such certificate
shall serve as notice to the property owner or vendee who has applied for the certificate pursuant to this section,
a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property that fulfillment and
implementation of the conditions set forth in the certificate shall be required prior to the subsequent issuance of
a permit or other grant or approval for the development of the property. Compliance with such conditions shall
not be required until such time as a permit or other grant of approval for development of such property is issued
by the City.

16.22.050 Notice of violation.
If the Planning Department has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the provisions of the
State Subdivision Map Act or this title, a notice of intention to record a notice of violation shall be mailed by the
Department by certified mail to the current owner of record. The notice shall describe the property in detail,
name the owners, describe the violation and state that the owner will be given the opportunity to present
evidence. The notice shall also contain an explanation as to why the subject parcel is not lawful under Sections
66412.6(a) and (b) of the State Subdivision Map Act. The notice shall specify the date, time and place for a
meeting at which the owner may present evidence to the Director of Planning and Building and City Attorney why
a notice of violation should not be recorded.
The meeting shall be held no sooner than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date of mailing of the notice
of intention to record a notice of violation. If, within 15 days of receipt of the notice, the owner fails to file with the
Department a written objection to recording the notice of violation, the Department shall file the notice of violation
for record with the County Recorder. If, after the owner has presented evidence, staff determines that there has
been no violation, the Department shall mail a clearance letter to the then-current owner of record. If, however,
after the owner has presented evidence, staff determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, the
Department shall record the notice of violation for record with the County Recorder. The notice of violation, when
recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of the violation to all successors in interest in such
property.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Sections:
17.08.010 Purpose.
17.08.020 Affordable housing requirements – Residential development.
17.08.030 Affordable housing incentives.
17.08.040 Affordable housing requirements – Nonresidential development.
17.08.050 Affordable Housing Fund.
17.08.010 Purpose.
The City recognizes the importance of working towards a balance of jobs and housing in the community,
promoting housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households and addressing the special housing
needs of such groups as seniors, farmworkers and the disabled. Because of the high cost of land and financing,
the private market has difficulty addressing these needs. Therefore, the City establishes the following
regulations and incentives, along with the Affordable Housing Fund to promote the development of affordable and
special needs housing in Calistoga. (Ord. 709 § 2, 2015).
17.08.020 Affordable housing requirements – Residential development.
A. Purpose. It is the intent of the City to partially offset the impacts of market-rate residential development on the
potential development of affordable housing in the community because the development of market-rate housing
reduces the inventory of developable sites within the City limits and increases the demand for services that
generally employ lower-wage workers. Therefore, market-rate projects shall support the development of
affordable housing by meeting the requirements of this section.
B. Applicability.
1. The provisions of this section shall apply to residential subdivisions of five or more parcels or
condominiums, and to rental projects of five or more units, with the exception of the following:
a. Projects that are to be developed pursuant to the terms of a development agreement or vesting
subdivision map executed prior to the effective date of the ordinance adopting these regulations.
b. Projects that received subdivision map approval prior to the effective date of the ordinance adopting
these regulations.
C. Inclusionary Requirements.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 17 ZONING Page 571 of 870
1. Ownership projects with between five and 19 dwelling units shall meet their inclusionary housing
requirement through the payment of an in-lieu fee, as provided in subsection (C)(5)(a) of this section, for
each unit in the project.
2. Ownership projects with 20 or more dwelling units and rental projects of five or more units shall provide
inclusionary housing units as follows:
a. At least 20 percent of the project’s total dwelling units shall be sold or rented at prices or rents
affordable to moderate-income households and shall be restricted to their purchase or rental and
occupancy by such households (“inclusionary units”).
b. Alternatively, at least 10 percent of the project’s total dwelling units shall be sold or rented at prices
or rents affordable to low-income households and shall be restricted to their purchase or rental and
occupancy by such households (“inclusionary units”).
3. Target Household and Affordability Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
a. “Moderate-income household” shall mean a household whose annual gross income does not exceed
120 percent of median income adjusted by actual household size for households in the County of
Napa, California, as published from time to time by the State of California.
b. “Low-income household” shall mean a household whose annual gross income does not exceed 80
percent of median income adjusted by actual household size for households in the County of Napa,
California, as published from time to time by the State of California.
c. A unit is “affordable” if it meets the requirements for affordable housing costs for moderate-income
or low-income households, as applicable, established by Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5 and
regulations adopted by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (California
Code of Regulations Title 25, Sections 6910 through 6924) determining affordability of residential
housing units based upon family size and income levels. Housing costs shall include homeowner
association fees, if applicable.
4. Fractional Units. In determining the number of inclusionary units required, fractional units that may result
from the application of these requirements shall be satisfied by one of the two following methods, at the
discretion of the applicant:
a. Fractional numbers of inclusionary units may be “rounded up” to the nearest whole integer and
treated as a whole inclusionary unit.
b. Payment of a portion of the in-lieu fee allowed pursuant to subsection (C)(5)(a) of this section in an
amount equivalent to the remaining fractional portion of the inclusionary unit requirement.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 17 ZONING Page 572 of 870
5. Alternatives. Upon a finding by the Planning Commission or City Council, as appropriate, that the on-site
provision of the required inclusionary units is not feasible or appropriate, the applicant shall meet the
inclusionary requirement through one or more of the following alternatives:
a. In-Lieu Fee Payment.
i. The inclusionary housing requirement may be satisfied through the payment of an affordable
housing in-lieu fee for each unit in the project.

inclusionary units required for the project. Identification of the land to be dedicated shall be
accomplished prior to approval of the discretionary permit for the residential development project.
ii. In addition to any other findings required by the Calistoga Municipal Code, any project approval
for an in-lieu land dedication shall include a finding that the land to be dedicated is not subject to
liens, is served or proposed to be served by municipal services, including water, sewer, roads,
electricity, telephone and other similar customary services, and contains no unusual planning or
development constraints.
iii. In-lieu land shall be dedicated to the City or for-profit or nonprofit affordable housing developer.
The City Council may approve, conditionally approve or reject such offer of dedication. If the City
Council rejects such offer of dedication, the applicant or developer shall be required to meet the
inclusionary housing requirement by other means set forth in this section.
c. Off-Site Inclusionary Units.
i. Some or all of the inclusionary units required for a project may be constructed on another site or
sites within the City limits. The resultant linked project sites shall be reviewed concurrently by the
City. Inclusionary housing units not built on the site of the proposed original project shall be

units unless an alternative schedule based on extenuating circumstances is adopted as part of project
approval.
2. Inclusionary units shall be distributed throughout the residential project site to the fullest extent
practicable.
3. Rental housing that is subject to the same affordable housing restrictions may be used to fulfill an

and quality of the market-rate units.
6. The lot size of inclusionary units may be smaller than that of the market-rate units in a subdivision,

project design in terms of appearance, materials and finished quality, as determined through the design
review process.

regulations:
For the purpose of this section, the average slope of a lot or parcel shall be determined according to the formula:
S =
0.0023 IL
A
where:
S is the average slope in percent;
I is the contour interval in feet;
L is the combined length of contour lines in feet;
A is the gross area in acres of the parcel or lot as applicable.
B. In measuring the slope, a topographic base map prepared by the United States Geological Service (USGS) or
similar map as approved by the City Engineer shall be used. Contour measurement shall be made at contour
intervals no more than 10 feet.
C. Each individual lot resulting from the proposed subdivision of hillside land shall require an average slope (S)
calculation. No average slope for an individual lot shall exceed 30 percent. Existing legal lots of record with
greater than 30 percent slope shall be allowed to contain only one dwelling unit.
D. In calculating the average percent of slope, any part of a parcel may be excluded from the calculation if
requested by the owner and the Planning Commission so elects. However, in calculating allowable land use
densities applicable to the parcel, only the land used in the slope calculation shall be used. If land is excluded
from the calculation of density, the land must remain undeveloped and a deed restriction recorded.
E. The minimum land area per dwelling unit shall not be less than “a” as determined by the formula, where “S” is
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 17 ZONING Page 593 of 870
the average slope of a lot or a parcel not exceeding 30 percent:
a =
1
1.089 –
0.017798S
F. Minimum lot sizes shall also be determined in additional ways:
1. Except for clustered development designs, minimum lot sizes shall be determined by the Planning
Commission to range from 40,000 square feet to 200,000 square feet depending on the availability of City
sewer and water services, as indicated in the General Plan.
2. Clustered development designs, as encouraged in the General Plan and as allowed to provide incentives
to create open space, may contain smaller lot sizes when determined appropriate by the Planning
Commission. In any other instances where it might be unclear what is the minimum lot size allowed, the
Planning Commission shall make that determination.
G. Lands in excess of an average slope of 30 percent shall be shown on subdivision maps in either of two ways:
1. As permanent open space shown on all maps maintained by a homeowner association, open space
association, some other type of district, or other similar organization as approved by the Planning
Commission; or
2. As land included within the designated subdivision lots (those lots with average slopes of 30 percent or
less). The area of lands over 30 percent average slope cannot be used in any area or density calculations
with those lands of slopes 30 percent or under (see subsection (D) of this section). (Ord. 699 § 2, 2014).

The Community Commercial (CC) District is intended to implement the Community Commercial land use

provide for the day-to-day needs of residents, and because of their operational characteristics and space needs
(storage, size, parking, etc.) are considered appropriate for the CC district.
The CC district is also intended to provide a transition between the more intense activities in the DC district and
the less intense activities in the residential districts adjacent to commercial areas. Therefore, mixed residentialcommercial
uses are appropriate in the CC district. Except for visitor accommodations and live-work units, all
newly constructed floor area located above a first floor is encouraged to be for resident-serving commercial uses
and/or residential.
In order to maintain and enhance Calistoga’s small-town character, development in the CC district shall be
guided by relevant policies of the General Plan’s Community Identity Element and the character areas, gateways
and entry corridors of the Land Use Element. (Ord. 714 § 4 (Exh. A), 2015).

Article I. General Provisions
17.24.010 Purpose.
The purpose of the planned development district is to provide locations for well-planned developments that

individual zoning district regulations. (Ord. 719 § 2, 2015).
17.24.020 Base and combining PD districts.
A. A PD may be established as a base district or as a combining district. When used as a combining district, the
PD designation may be combined with any base zoning district.

such as building height, lot coverage, parking, landscaping and lot sizes and dimensions.
B. Standards for lot area and dimensions, coverage, yards, building heights, landscaping and parking for uses in
a PD base district shall be the standards of the zoning district governing uses most similar in nature and function
to the uses proposed in the PD district. Exceptions to these standards may be allowed by the Planning
Commission and the City Council when it can be demonstrated that such modified standards would result in
more desirable development and are warranted in terms of the relationship of the total proposed development or
units thereof in the General Plan. (Ord. 719 § 2, 2015).
17.24.050 Application requirements.
An application for a PD district classification shall be accompanied by:
A. A written and/or diagrammatic project description that provides sufficient information to evaluate the merits of

certain development standards. In accordance with Government Code Section 65852.2, this chapter shall not be
considered in the application of any local ordinance, policy or program to limit residential growth, and does not
propose to preclude the creation of accessory dwelling units or serve as the basis for denial of a building permit.

C. An accessory dwelling unit may be rented or leased; provided, that it is rented or leased for periods of 30
consecutive days or more.
D. Utilities.
1. The utility services for a newly constructed accessory dwelling unit that is detached from the primary
unit, including water, sewer and electricity, shall be separately metered from the primary dwelling unit.
2. A new or separate utility connection is not required if an accessory dwelling unit is created within the
existing space of the one-family residence or an accessory structure, and no related connection fee or
capacity charge shall be assessed.

permits required by various sections of this title. Uses that require use permit approval have been determined to
have a special character that makes their establishment as a permitted or accessory use without prior review
impractical and undesirable. This review shall be for the purpose of determining that each proposed use is, and
will continue to be, compatible with surrounding existing and planned uses. It is also for the purpose of
establishing special conditions as may be necessary to ensure the harmonious integration and compatibility of
uses in the neighborhood and with surrounding areas. (Ord. 728 § 4, 2017).

determine the completeness of the application.
4. Only an application for a use permit which has been determined to be complete shall be processed
pursuant to the requirements of this title.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 17 ZONING Page 727 of 870
C. The filing of the application for a use permit shall not preclude the securing of additional information from the
developer necessary for the proper consideration of a use permit nor does it insure that the use permit request
complies with the law and with the requirements of this title.
D. If other approvals are required by this title, an application for a use permit may be filed and processed
concurrently with the related entitlement request(s), and shall be acted upon simultaneously by the decisionmaking
authority.
E. Following the denial of a use permit application or the revocation of a use permit, no application for such
permit for the same or substantially the same use and design or use of the same or substantially the same site
shall be filed within one year from the date of denial or revocation. (Ord. 728 § 4, 2017).
17.40.030 Review procedures.

Commission for action.
B. The Planning Commission shall act on a use permit application following a public hearing.
C. Action on a use permit application may include approving the permit in its original or modified form, and with
such terms and conditions that are deemed appropriate or necessary as required by CMC 17.40.040. If no terms
or conditions are specified, the use permit shall be considered unconditional and valid for an indefinite period,
unless the use is abandoned for more than 180 days.
D. In approving or conditionally approving a use permit application, the decision-making authority shall make the
following findings that the proposed use:
1. Is in accord with the General Plan and any applicable planned development.
2. Is in accord with all applicable provisions of this title.
3. Will not substantially impair or interfere with the development, use or enjoyment of other property in the
vicinity.
4. Is consistent with and enhances Calistoga’s history of independently owned businesses, thus
contributing to the uniqueness of the town, which is necessary to maintain a viable visitor industry and

1. A building permit is issued and the applicant, in good faith, has diligently commenced construction and
performed substantial work and incurred substantial liabilities in reliance thereon; or
2. A certificate of occupancy is issued for the structure which was the subject of the use permit application;
or
3. The site is occupied and the activity has commenced, if no building permit or certificate of occupancy is
required.
B. The Director may extend the time limit established by subsection (A) of this section by up to 12 months for a
use permit’s approval to be exercised, subject to the following:
1. A written request for an extension of time shall be filed with the Planning and Building Department at
least 30 days before the expiration of the one-year period, together with the filing fee required by resolution
of the City Council. Expiration of the approval will be stayed until the decision on the extension request if
the request is filed 30 days before the original expiration.
2. In approving a time extension, the Director shall determine that:
a. The applicant has made a good faith effort to exercise the approval. The burden of proof is on the
applicant to establish, with substantial evidence beyond the control of the applicant (e.g.,
demonstration of financial hardship, legal problems with the closure of the sale of the parcel, poor
weather conditions in which to complete construction activities, etc.), why the permit or approval
should be extended.
b. Conditions of the site and in the vicinity are substantially the same as when the approval was
originally granted.
3. A use permit shall remain valid as long as the approved use is maintained in continuous operation and in
full compliance with any adopted conditions of approval.
4. A use permit shall become null and void under either of the following circumstances:

17.43.010 Purpose and intent.
Home occupation permits are intended to limit enterprises conducted within homes in residential zoning districts
to those which are clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the residence. A home occupation permit
allows for gainful employment in the home by the occupant(s) of the dwelling to the extent that the enterprise
does not have associated characteristics which would reduce the surrounding residents enjoyment of their
neighborhood. (Ord. 714 § 5, 2015. Formerly 17.21.010).

Home occupations shall be permitted in the following residential zoning districts: R-R, RR-H, R-1, R-2, R-3,
MHP, and PD when combined with an underlying residential classification. In the event a residence is located in
a commercial or industrial zoning classification and is a legal nonconforming use or legally established in
accordance with the provisions of this title, a home occupation permit may be issued. In the event the primary
use as a residence ceases, the continued use of the structure shall be in accordance with the applicable zoning
classification. (Ord. 714 § 5, 2015. Formerly 17.21.020).
17.43.030 Permitting and revocation procedures.
A. Authority for a home occupation permit shall be vested with the Planning and Building Department. A public
hearing shall not be required for the issuance of a home occupation permit.
B. An application for a home occupation shall be made on forms provided by the Planning and Building
Department and shall be accompanied by fees as approved by Council resolution.
C. Upon approval of a home occupation permit, a business license shall be obtained and shall be maintained
annually for the life of the home occupation. In the event of an employee, proof of worker’s compensation shall
be provided prior to the issuance of a business license.
D. Failure to maintain a valid business license may result in revocation of a home occupation permit.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 17 ZONING Page 740 of 870
E. Failure to comply with the conditions of operation as stated in CMC 17.43.030 may result in the revocation of
a home occupation permit.
F. Once revoked a home occupation permit for the same or a similar type of occupation shall not be issued to
the same person or address for a period of one year from revocation. (Ord. 714 § 5, 2015. Formerly 17.21.030).
17.43.040 Conditions for operation.
The following conditions shall apply to all home occupation permits:
A. The home occupation shall be conducted entirely within a dwelling and/or a garage and must be clearly
subordinate to the use of the property for residential purposes.
B. A home occupation within a garage shall not impair the daily use of the garage by maintaining storage area for
at least one automobile.
C. The home occupation shall not alter the appearance of the dwelling unit such that the structure is likely to be
recognized as serving a nonresidential use (either by color, materials or construction, lighting, signs, sounds,
noise, vibration and the like).
D. There shall be no signs other than the name and address of the resident(s).
E. There shall be no advertising on or in the vicinity of the property or otherwise which identifies the home
occupation by street address.
F. No commercial vehicles may be used for delivery of materials, with the exception of occasional and
reasonable courier services to or from the premises, and no more than one vehicle larger than a three-quarterton
truck may be used in connection with a home occupation.
G. Activities conducted, equipment, or hazardous materials shall be identified on the permit application and shall
not change the fire safety or occupancy classifications of the premises.
H. No use shall create or cause hazards or nuisances due to noise, dust, vibration, odors, smoke, glare,
electrical interference or other reasons.
I. Not more than one employee other than the resident(s) of the dwelling shall be allowed to work, gather or
congregate on the premises in connection with a home occupation with the exception of babysitters or domestic
staff. Home occupation utilizing an outside employee must provide additional adequate parking.
J. Winery-related home occupations shall be limited to administrative activities, barrel aging and storage. Indoor
storage of up to two barrels or 50 cases of wine shall be permitted. Home wineries shall comply with any grape
sourcing requirements that are applicable to the facility at which the fruit used to produce the wine is crushed.

be permitted on the premises.
K. Home occupations utilizing an outside employee shall provide adequate worker’s compensation.

attached garage not normally associated with residential use.
N. The home occupation shall not result in the use of water, sewer, electrical or natural gas utilities in amounts
greater than normally used for residential purposes.
O. The home occupation permit shall be valid only for the person to whom it is issued, at the address at which it
is issued, and during the period of time for which a valid, unexpired City business license is in effect. Failure to
properly renew said license or failure to comply with any of the conditions of approval will render the permit null
and void. (Ord. 714 § 5, 2015; Ord. 679 § 12, 2012. Formerly 17.21.040).
17.43.050 Prohibited home occupation uses.

accommodation will comply with the findings required by subsection (A) of this section, including, without
limitation, conditions that require alternative reasonable accommodations that provide an equivalent level of
benefit.

appealed pursuant to procedures set forth in Chapter 1.20 CMC (Appeals). (Ord. 691 § 2, 2013).

18.04.020 Findings of fact.
18.04.030 Statement of purpose.
18.04.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
18.04.010 Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred
upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Calistoga does hereby adopt the following floodplain
management regulations. (Ord. 564 § 2, 2000).
18.04.020 Findings of fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of the City of Calistoga are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood
damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 564 § 2, 2000).
18.04.030 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this title to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer

Calistoga Municipal Code Title 18 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT Page 778 of 870
lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood
hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and ensure that
those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 564 § 2, 2000).
18.04.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this title includes methods and provisions to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards,
or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help
accommodate or channel flood waters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and
E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 564 § 2, 2000).

elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the
property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that
those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is
subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. (Ord. 564 § 2,

result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Council requires that the variance be exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional.
Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved
through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the
property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. (Ord. 564 § 2,
2000).

Chapter 18.24
VARIANCE PROCEDURE
Sections:
18.24.010 Nature of variances.
18.24.020 Requests for variances.
18.24.030 Conditions for variances.
18.24.010 Nature of variances.
The variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances
pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property
with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an
exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to
the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not
to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the
implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood
elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and
reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance
guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a
variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives
other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 564 § 2, 2000).
18.24.020 Requests for variances.
A. The City Council shall hear all requests for variances.
B. In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this title, and the:
1. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
2. Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on
the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
4. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
5. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 18 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT Page 802 of 870
6. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion
damage;
7. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that
area;
9. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
10. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at
the site; and
11. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and
bridges.
C. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community
official that:
1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and
2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
3. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the
Office of the Napa Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land.
D. The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their
issuance, and will report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 564 § 2, 2000).
18.24.030 Conditions for variances.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new
development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Chapters 18.16 and
18.20 CMC have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 18 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT Page 803 of 870
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in CMC 18.08.185)
upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result. (Ord. 564 § 2, 2000).

19.01.010 Purpose.
A. In enacting this chapter, the Council finds that this City is primarily a residential and tourist community and
that the economics of property values is inseparably connected with the rural attractiveness of the area, to which
much is contributed by the wooded hillsides and the native and ornamental trees scattered throughout our City.
Further, the Council finds that such trees contribute to the health, safety, welfare and well-being of the City and
the residents thereof by:
1. The establishment of natural watershed areas;
2. The control of damage resulting from soil erosion and flooding; and
3. The known capacity of trees for the conversion to oxygen from carbon dioxide thereby reducing air
pollution.
B. The Council finds that the destruction of trees injures the scenic beauty of the City; causes erosion of topsoil,
creates flood hazard and risk of landslides; reduces property values, increases the cost of construction and
maintenance of draining systems through the increased flow and diversion of surface waters; and eliminates one
of the prime oxygen producers in this area.
C. For these reasons, the Council finds it is in the public interest, convenience and necessity to enact
regulations controlling the removal of trees within this City. (Ord. 465, 1991).
19.01.020 Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall be construed as defined in this section.
A. “Arborist” shall mean an arborist certified by the Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture

B. “DBH (diameter at breast height)” shall mean the diameter of a tree at four and one-half feet (54 inches)
above the ground on the high side of the trunk, as determined from a measurement of the circumference at that
level and by the formula:
Diameter = Circumference ÷ (3.142)
In the case of a tree with two or more trunks, the DBH height is the sum of the diameters of all the trunks at
breast height.
C. “Disturbance” shall mean any action which is likely to damage or to produce a negative impact of detrimental
effect on the life or health of a tree. (See CMC 19.01.040(C)).

19.02.010 Purpose.
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare by: (A)
ensuring that development remains within the limits established by the City’s General Plan; (B) encouraging
growth that is properly matched with essential public facilities and services; and (C) preserving the unique smalltown
character of the community which is vital to protecting the existing quality of life and strengthening the local
economy and tax base. This chapter provides a mechanism for the City to select development proposals based
on a set of specific development objectives including, but not limited to, housing that is affordable to families with
lower and moderate incomes, infill development or redevelopment over development at the City’s edges, and
mixed-use development. (Ord. 664 § 2, 2009; Ord. 660 § 2, 2009; Ord. 624 § 1, 2005; Ord. 616 § 1, 2004).
19.02.020 Objectives.
Protection of the public health, safety and general welfare requires the City establishes a growth management
system to accomplish the following:
A. Facilitate and implement the City’s General Plan, including the goals and policies contained in the land use,
housing, community identity, open space, economic development, conservation and infrastructure elements,
which cannot be accomplished by zoning ordinances alone;
B. Provide a reasonable and understandable mechanism to phase growth over the term of the General Plan at a
pace that does not exceed the City’s ability to provide the resources, services and facilities necessary to
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 19 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Page 814 of 870
accommodate its existing residents and businesses; avoids large fluctuations in the rate of population and
employment growth; and maintains compliance with the City’s share of the region-wide housing need to minimize
exposure to legal challenges, provide access to funding to secure affordable housing development, and ensure
vital State subventions are protected into the future;
C. Regulate new residential growth in accordance with the population growth rate established in the General
Plan;
D. Regulate the pace of new nonresidential growth in accordance with the goals and objectives established in the
General Plan;
E. Give preference to lower-income housing development by encouraging developers to include subsidized
housing in their projects beyond the minimum amount required by local ordinance or to provide equitable
financial assistance to the community to accomplish this goal;
F. Give preference to moderate-income housing development by encouraging developers to pursue residential
developments which through deed restrictions or other provisions will ensure their long-term availability to
households of moderate incomes;
G. Promote infill development over new development at the edges of town;
H. Integrate new growth into existing developed areas which encourages reinvestment in the maintenance and
rehabilitation of older residential neighborhoods or established commercial areas, expansion of existing uses,
enhances efficient use of municipal services by avoiding unnecessary extensions, and promotes housing near
employment centers which tends to be more affordable to a broader economic segment of the community;
I. Reduce dependency on the automobile by providing a mix of housing types in pedestrian-oriented
neighborhoods located near City parks, commercial retail uses and services, and public transit;
J. Provide a balance of residential and nonresidential growth to ensure the community’s unique quality of life and
economic well-being; and
K. Recognize Federal and State preemptions on residential development, such as for second dwelling units, and
establish a process for providing resources to residential units with existing prior City commitments and where
substantial investments in the implementation of infrastructure are already in place. (Ord. 664 § 2, 2009; Ord.
660 § 2, 2009; Ord. 624 § 1, 2005; Ord. 616 § 1, 2004).

The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 19 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Page 819 of 870
within the five-year cycle, pursuant to the following formulas:
Annual Residential Allocation = Population x 1.35 percent/Household Size
“Population” is based upon the most recent available estimates provided by the State Department of
Finance.
“Household Size” reflects the average number of persons per household, as provided by the State
Department of Finance.
Where the “Annual Residential Allocation” is a fraction, this amount shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
number. Final assessment of population generation will be based upon information provided by the U.S. Census
Bureau (H33. Population by Units in Structure by Tenure).
Annual Nonresidential Allocation = Water Supply x Percentage Distribution for Nonresidential Uses
“Water Supply” is the total amount of water (in acre-feet) available to serve Calistoga in the calendar year.
“Percentage Distribution” is the percentage of water supply to be designated for nonresidential uses as
specified in Chapter 13.16 CMC.
B. Following the Planning and Building Director’s report provided in subsection (A) of this section, the City
Manager shall prepare and distribute a written report to the City Council assessing community conditions,
including the adequacy of existing services and facilities, availability of resources and current development and
growth trends. In conjunction with this report the Public Works Director shall provide information on current
water use by all land uses, the quantity of unallocated water including the quantity and total percentage of overall
system losses and emergency reserves, the quantity of wastewater which is being treated, and the permitted
treatment capacity of the wastewater treatment plant taking into consideration the ability to properly dispose the
treated effluent. The report shall also include a determination on whether there is sufficient capacity to serve
projected allocations for the upcoming year and for the five-year cycle. Allocations shall not be made by the City
where there is inadequate water or wastewater treatment capacity.
The City Manager’s report shall present the Planning Commission’s annual recommendation to the City Council
regarding the proposed development objectives for the upcoming year. The City Manager’s report may
recommend that certain development objectives be adopted by City Council.
C. Within 30 days from receipt of the City Manager’s report, and not later than September 15th of each year, the
City Council, by resolution, shall confirm the number of residential units and amount of water for nonresidential
use available for allocation and establish a list of development objectives for residential and nonresidential
development by order of priority for the upcoming year. The list may or may not include the general development
objectives identified in CMC 19.02.070(A) and (B), and shall be consistent with goals and policies in the City’s
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 19 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Page 820 of 870
General Plan. The list shall be used by the City to evaluate applications for allocations in the event that the
number of allocations requested in a given year exceeds the number of allocations that are available for that
year. When the availability of annual allocations for residential units is less than what would normally be allowed
for accommodating a population growth rate of 1.35 percent, priority in awarding allocations for residential units
shall be given to lower income housing projects and to special needs housing projects.
D. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the allocation confirmed in subsection (C) of this section, as
having adequate water and wastewater treatment capacity to serve the development, shall represent the amount
of residential and nonresidential development that may receive allocations in a calendar year.
E. Where there is no allocation available for distribution by the City, a resolution shall be adopted by the City
suspending the allocation procedures contained in this chapter until the following calendar year.
F. Annual allocations may be increased by drawing from unused annual allocations in previous, current or future
five-year cycles, as approved by City Council resolution; provided, that the combined average residential
allocations do not result in a population growth rate of more than 1.35 percent or a nonresidential water
distribution exceeding the quantity specified in Chapter 13.16 CMC for the five-year cycle(s) from which the
allocations are drawn.
G. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no development may be determined to be complete or will be
approved until the development has received an allocation pursuant to the following procedures:
1. Not later than November 30th of each year, the City shall conduct a competitive evaluation of
applications for annual residential or nonresidential allocations, if such have been determined to be
available, and shall award allocations by resolution. The competitive evaluation shall begin with an open
enrollment period in which applications for allocations shall be submitted. The enrollment period shall be
noticed in a local newspaper of general circulation and shall be open for a period of no less than 30 days.
2. Applications for annual allocations shall be submitted to the Planning and Building Department before the
close of regular business hours on the last day of open enrollment period. Applications shall be
accompanied by the required submittal materials and fee, as provided in CMC 19.02.040.
3. No application for development shall be processed by the City unless the land use proposed is
determined by the Planning and Building Department to be consistent with the General Plan’s Land Use
Designation as reflected on the current Land Use Map (Figure LU-4) and the City’s Zoning District as
reflected on the current Zoning District Map. (Note: Any required General Plan amendment or rezoning will
need to be secured prior to requesting allocations.)
4. Applications which are not in conformity with the adopted General Plan Land Use Designation and Zoning
District on the date of submittal, or require an amendment to the adopted General Plan or Zoning

Ordinance, excluding applications on property designated as Planned Development in the General Plan and
Zoning Ordinance, and which are not consistent with key General Plan goals, objectives and policies shall
not be eligible for an allocation.
5. Upon the close of the period by which applications for allocations may be accepted, the Planning and
Building Department shall review each application for completeness. Applications determined to be
incomplete after the close of the application period will not be recommended by staff to receive an
allocation.
6. All applications received shall be evaluated by the City Council and awarded allocations in accordance
with the preferences established in CMC 19.02.070.
7. Applications for projects exceeding available annual allocations may be awarded allocations from the
combined average annual allocation identified under subsection (F) of this section; provided, that the
allocations do not result in a population growth rate of more than 1.35 percent or a nonresidential water
distribution exceeding the quantity specified in Chapter 13.16 CMC for the five-year cycle(s) from which the
allocations are being drawn.
8. Applicants who are not awarded an allotment shall be sent notice of such decision within 10 days after
the decision. Such notice shall inform the applicant of the decision and the right to reapply for an allocation
in the next application period. Such applicants will not be subject to filing fees provided the same
application is resubmitted.
9. Applications for the construction of residential units sponsored by a nonprofit housing organization that
fulfill the City’s remaining regional housing need in the very-low, low- and moderate-income housing
categories as defined by the General Plan may be submitted at any time during the year for consideration
of an allocation reservation for the next allocation period.
H. Once a development has received an allocation, all required discretionary and nondiscretionary approvals and
permits necessary to commence construction must be obtained within 24 months of the date of allocation. In the
case of a subdivision, recordation of a final subdivision map or final parcel map must be completed within 36
months of the date of allocation. With respect to subdivisions, the following additional provisions shall apply:
1. All necessary permits for construction on the lots of record shall be obtained and construction
commenced on all lots of record within three years of the recordation of the final map.
2. Thirty percent of the required water and wastewater connection fee shall be paid for all of the lots of
record within 18 months of the recordation of the final map.
3. If at the end of the three-year period, the processing of permits for construction has not been obtained
and construction commenced, the water and wastewater connection fee paid to the City shall be forfeited.

This chapter shall be known as the City “Stormwater Runoff Pollution Control Ordinance,” and may be cited as
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 19 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Page 831 of 870
such, and will be referred to herein as “this chapter.” (Ord. 707 § 1, 2015; Ord. 607 § 1, 2004).
19.05.020 Purpose and intent.
The purposes of this chapter are to protect the health, safety and general welfare of City of Calistoga residents;
to protect water resources and to improve water quality; to protect and enhance watercourses, fish, and wildlife
habitat; to cause the use of management practices by the City and its citizens that will reduce the adverse
effects of polluted runoff discharges on waters of the State; to secure benefits from the use of stormwater as a
resource; and to ensure the City is compliant with applicable State and Federal law. This chapter seeks to
promote these purposes by:
A. Prohibiting illicit discharges to the stormwater conveyance system;
B. Establishing authority to adopt minimum requirements for stormwater management, including source control
requirements, to prevent and reduce pollution;
C. Establishing authority to adopt requirements for development project site design, to reduce stormwater
pollution and erosion both during construction and after project is complete;
D. Establishing authority to adopt requirements for the management of stormwater flows from development
projects, both to prevent erosion and to protect and enhance existing water-dependent habitats; and
E. Establishing authority to adopt standards for the use of off-site facilities for stormwater management to
supplement on-site practices at new development sites. (Ord. 707 § 1, 2015; Ord. 607 § 1, 2004).
19.05.030 Definitions.
A. The following words, when used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings:
1. “BASMAA Post-Construction Manual” means the most recent version of the Bay Area Stormwater
Management Agencies Association (BASMAA) Post-Construction Manual.
2. “Best management practices (BMPs)” means schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, general
good housekeeping practices, pollution prevention and educational practices, maintenance procedures, and
other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants directly or indirectly to
stormwater, receiving waters, or stormwater conveyance systems. BMPs also include treatment practices,
operating procedures, and practices to control site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or water disposal, or
drainage from raw materials storage.
3. “City” means the City of Calistoga.
4. “Construction activity” means any activity that involves soil disturbing activities including, but not limited
to, clearing, paving, grading, disturbances to ground such as stockpiling, and excavation.
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 19 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Page 832 of 870
5. “Development” means any activity that moves soils or substantially alters the preexisting vegetated or
manmade cover of any land. This includes, but is not limited to, grading, digging, cutting, scraping,
stockpiling or excavating of soil, placement of fill materials, paving, pavement removal, exterior
construction, substantial removal of vegetation where soils are disturbed including but not limited to
removal by clearing or grubbing, or any activity which bares soil or rock or involves streambed alterations
or the diversion or piping of any watercourse. Development does not include routine maintenance to
maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or the original purpose of the facility, nor does it include
emergency construction activities (i.e., land disturbances) required to protect public health and safety.
6. “Development runoff requirements” means the provisions in the Phase II Stormwater Permit that contain
design standards or performance criteria to address both the construction and post-construction phase
impacts of new projects and redeveloped projects on stormwater quality and quantity.
7. “Director of Public Works” or “Director” means the Director of the City of Calistoga Department of Public
Works.
8. “Discharge of a pollutant” or “discharge” means the release, addition or deposit of any fluid, liquid, solid,
flowing substance, or any other material or substance to the City’s stormwater conveyance system.
9. “Employee training program” means a documented employee training program which may be required to
be implemented by a business pursuant to a stormwater pollution prevention plan for the purpose of
educating its employees on methods of reducing discharge of pollutants to the stormwater conveyance
system.
10. “Enforcement agency” means the City of Calistoga Public Works Department.
11. “Enforcement Official” or “authorized Enforcement Official” means the Director of Public Works or his
or her designee or any agent of the City authorized to enforce compliance with this chapter.
12. “Erosion and sediment control plan” means a plan prepared to control erosion and sediment discharges
from a construction site that meets those criteria identified in the most recent version of the Napa
Countywide Erosion and Sediment Control Plan Model Template and any issued technical bulletins.
13. “Illicit discharge” means any discharge to a stormwater conveyance system or receiving water that is
not composed entirely of stormwater that is prohibited under local, State, or Federal statutes, ordinances,
codes or regulations. The term “illicit discharge” does not include discharges that are regulated by an
NPDES permit (other than the Phase II Stormwater Permit) and discharges that are identified under CMC
19.05.060, Exceptions to discharge prohibition.
14. “Illicit connection” means a pipe, facility, or other device, whether on the surface or subsurface, which
The Calistoga Municipal Code is current through Ordinance 741, and legislation passed through December 4, 2018.
Calistoga Municipal Code Title 19 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Page 833 of 870
allows an illicit discharge to enter the stormwater conveyance system or receiving water regardless of
whether said drain or connection had been previously allowed, permitted, or approved by a government
agency.
15. “Incidental irrigation runoff” (i.e., nonagricultural) means unintended amounts (volume) of runoff, such
as unintended, minimal overspray from sprinklers that escapes the landscaped area of intended use. Water
leaving an intended use area is not considered incidental if it is part of the facility design, if it is due to
excessive application, if it is due to intentional overflow or application, or if it is due to negligence.
16. “Low impact development (LID)” means a sustainable practice that benefits water supply and
contributes to water quality protection. LID uses site design and stormwater management to maintain the
site’s predevelopment runoff rates and volumes. The goal of LID is to mimic a site’s predevelopment
hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff close to the
source of rainfall.
17. “Maximum extent practicable (MEP)” means a technology-based standard established by Congress in
the Clean Water Act Section 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) for stormwater discharge that municipalities must meet. MEP
is generally the result of emphasizing pollution prevention and source control best management practices
(BMPs) primarily (as the first line of defense) and in combination with treatment methods serving as

requirements to control runoff to prevent flooding for the protection of safety and property.
1. Prior to and/or during construction, the Enforcement Official may establish controls on the volume and
rate of stormwater runoff from new developments and redevelopment as may be appropriate to minimize
peak flows or total runoff volume, and to mimic the predevelopment site hydrology (for two-, 10-, and 100-
year, 24-hour events or as directed by Public Works Director). These controls may include limits on
impervious area or provisions for detention and retention of runoff on site.
2. The Enforcement Official may require, as a condition of project approval, permanent structural controls
designed for the removal of sediment and other pollutants and for control on the volume and rate of
stormwater runoff from the project’s added or replaced impervious surfaces. The selection and design of
such controls shall be in accordance with criteria established or recommended by Federal, State, and local
agencies, and, where required, the BASMAA Post-Construction Manual and any issued technical bulletins.
Where physical and safety conditions allow, the preferred control measure is to retain drainage ways,
above ground and in as natural a state as possible or other biological methods such as bioretention areas.
