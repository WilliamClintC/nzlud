PREFACE 
The Lincoln, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1982, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the city attorney. Beginning with the republication in 2015, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the 2015 Code were the 1982 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
This 2015 republication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice-President of Supplement Department, and Connie Hamilton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. The publisher is most grateful to Dia Gix, Deputy City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city. 
This republication brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 991B , passed May 28, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title, division, chapter and article. In addition, each title has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the beginning. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of 2015, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning in 2015, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning in 2015, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 5, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

(Ord. 479B §1(part), 1986)  
CHAPTER 1.20 - ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS 
 
1.20.005 - Legislative findings and statement of purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that there is a need for an alternative method of enforcement for minor violations of this code and applicable Uniform Codes. The city council further finds that an appropriate method of enforcement for minor violations is an administrative citation program as authorized by Government Code Section 53069.4. 
(b)  The procedures established in this chapter shall be in addition to criminal, civil or any other legal remedy established by law which may be pursued to address violations of this code or applicable Uniform Codes. 
(c)  The city council finds and determines that enforcement of this code, other ordinances adopted by the city, conditions on entitlements and terms and conditions of city agreements are matters of local concern and serve important public purposes. Consistent with its powers as a general law city, the city of Lincoln adopts this administrative citation program in order to achieve the following goals: 
(1)  To protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of Lincoln; 
(2)  To gain compliance with this code and Uniform Codes, ordinances and regulations in a timely and efficient manner;

Section 36801 Government Code of the state of California requires that the city council meet after a general municipal election to choose one of its members as mayor and one of its members as mayor pro tempore or vice-mayor.

(Ord. 674B §1(part), 1999)  
2.06.020 - Establishment of rotation. 
Effective on the first Tuesday following the general municipal election in November, 2000, the rotation for councilmembers determining who shall be chosen to serve as mayor and vice-mayor shall be based, to the extent possible, on the following rules and policies: 
(1)  The position of mayor shall be filled by an incumbent with at least two years of serviceon the city council; 
(2)  Upon the election or appointment of a new councilmember, the new individual shall be placed at the bottom of the rotation list. In the event of an election of more than one new individual to the city council, the ranking of order of the new councilmembers shall be in relation to the number of votes received at the election. The individual with the greatest number of votes shall be placed immediately below the incumbents including incumbents who are reelected. The individual with the second greatest number of votes shall be placed below the first and so on. Following an election, the previous incumbent mayor shall be placed in the rotation above the newly elected councilmembers and below other incumbents, including incumbents who are reelected. Incumbents shall stay in their position in the rotation relative to other incumbents, even after reelection. 
(3)  In instances where there are four or five new individuals elected to the city council, those individuals filling positions with shorter terms remaining shall be placed at the top of the rotation list, in order of votes received at the election. Councilmembers with longer terms shall be placed below the shorter term councilmembers on the rotation list, in order of votes received at the election.

(4)  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in these regulations may be considered. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.030 - Motel occupancy taxAmountWhere payable. 
(a)  For privilege of occupancy in any motel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. 
(b)  The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the motel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the motel. 
(c)  If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the motel, the tax administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.040 - Motel occupancy taxPersons exempt. 
No tax shall be imposed upon: 
(1)  Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided; 
(2)  Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business; 
(3)  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

3.21.050 - Motel occupancy taxCollection. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by the ordinance codified in this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt when requested for payment from the operator. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.060 - Motel occupancy registration certificate. 
Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in these regulations or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any motel renting occupancy to transients shall register such motel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a "motel occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
(1)  The name of the operator; 
(2)  The address of the motel; 
(3)  The date upon which the certificate was issued. 
(4)  "This Motel Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Motel Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the motel occupancy tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in any unlawful manner, nor to operate a motel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this county. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.070 - Reports and remittances. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.080 - Failure to remit taxPenalties. 
(a)  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of tax. 
(b)  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
(c)  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section.

In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties for the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
(e)  Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.090 - Operator failure to collect and report taxDetermination of taxNoticeHearing. 
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last-known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.21.100. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.100 - Appeal. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.110 - Records kept for three years. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of any payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.120 - Refunds. 
(a)  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under the ordinance codified in this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section; provided, a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
(b)  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator, that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
(c)  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
(d)  No refund shall be paid under the provision of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)  
3.21.130 - Action by city to collect tax. 
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provision of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. 
(Ord. 658B §1(part), 1998)

Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the city jail for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid.

Article VII. - Public Projects Subject to the Public Contract Code 
 
3.24.250 - Prequalification of bidders. 
(a)  Purpose. This section is enacted pursuant to Section 20101 of the California Public Contract Code, which authorizes the city to establish a system for prequalification of prospective bidders on public works construction and maintenance projects. In addition, pursuant to the city's general police powers under California Constitution Article 11, Section 7, the city desires to apply this process to the award of public works maintenance contracts in order to ensure that bidders are qualified to perform city public works maintenance. 
(b)  Prequalification of Bidders. 
(1)  The city hereby establishes a system for prequalification of prospective bidders for public works construction and maintenance projects. The city may use the prequalification system identified in this section for any public works project. 
(2)  The community development director is authorized to adopt and apply a uniform system of rating bidders for each project based on: 
a.  The requirements of Section 20101 of the California Public Contract Code, and 
b.  The model guidelines and standardized questionnaire created by the state of California Department of Industrial Relations, as modified at the city engineer's discretion to address the needs of the particular project, or projects, to which they are to be applied. 
(3)  a.  Prequalification of prospective bidders shall be conducted for public works projects that involve the construction, retrofitting, remodeling, renovation or expansion of public buildings, water or wastewater treatment facilities, water works; maintenance of roadways, drainage facilities, roadway landscaping, or parks; or require significant specialized experience or expertise, unless the city engineer determines that it is in the best interests of the city to forego prequalification of prospective bidders on a particular project. In making his or her determination whether it is in the best interests of the city to forego prequalification of prospective bidders on a particular project, the city engineer's decision shall be supported by one or more of the following reasons: 
1.  Prequalification of prospective bidders is likely to unreasonably adversely affect the cost of the project; 
2.  The complexity, scale or cost of the project does not warrant use of this prequalification process; 
3.  There is an urgent need, based upon concerns for the health and safety of the public, to pursue the project on an expedited basis; 
4.  The particular project is of such a specialized nature that there is a very limited pool of qualified potential bidders, and for this reason the purposes of the prequalification process may be accomplished by use of a bid questionnaire; or 
5.  The project will not be competitively bid. 
b.  Notwithstanding subsection (b)(3)a. of this section, the city engineer is authorized to require prequalification of prospective bidders on any public works project or to engage in a program of prequalification of prospective bidders, on public works projects on a recurring basis as provided in Section 20101 of the California Public Contract Code. 
(4)  If prequalification of prospective bidders is required for a particular project, the city engineer shall determine which bidders are qualified to bid that project based upon the uniform system of rating bidders. If the city engineer determines any bidder is not qualified to bid a project, the city engineer shall provide to the bidder written notice that includes the basis for the determination and an identification of any supporting evidence therefor, and an opportunity for the bidder to appeal the determination pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. A copy of all prequalification determinations shall be filed with the city clerk at least ten days prior to the scheduled bid opening. 
(c)  Appeals. 
(1)  Any person aggrieved by a determination made by the city engineer pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section may appeal the determination only by complying with the requirements set forth in this subsection. Such an aggrieved person shall be referred to herein as "appellant." Without a timely appeal, the appellant waives any and all rights to challenge the decision of the city engineer, whether by administrative process, judicial process or any other legal process or proceeding. 
(2)  The appellant shall submit a written notice of appeal to the city clerk, along with a complete written description of all factual and legal bases for the appeal and accompanied by a fee in the amount established by resolution of the city council, no later than ten days after the city has mailed written notice of the determination made by the city engineer. Should the appellant prevail in its appeal, the deposit shall be returned to the appellant and the city shall bear the costs of the appeal. If the appellant does not prevail, the deposit shall be used to pay all costs associated with the appeal. If the deposit is insufficient to pay the entirety of the costs of the appeal, the appellant shall pay the remaining costs within 30 days after the decision. Any failure by the appellant to timely pay any outstanding appeal costs, as required herein, shall be considered by the city in future prequalification proceedings. 
(3)  If the appellant gives the required notice of appeal, provides the necessary deposit, and requests a hearing, the hearing shall be conducted so that it is concluded no later than five business days prior to the last date for the receipt of bids on the project or 20 days following the city's receipt of the notice of appeal, whichever is sooner. The hearing shall be an informal process conducted by an arbitrator, who shall be an attorney experienced in public works and construction matters. The arbitrator may be selected by the mutual consent of the appellant and the city. If an agreement cannot be reached regarding the selection of the arbitrator, the appellant and the city shall each exchange a list of three arbitrators they would be willing to accept. In turn, beginning with the appellant, each party shall strike one name from the other party's list until only one name remains and that remaining person shall be the arbitrator. If the arbitrator selected is unavailable, the parties shall repeat the process until they succeed in selecting an available arbitrator. 
(4)  At the hearing, the appellant and the city shall each be provided an opportunity to be represented by legal counsel and to present or rebut any evidence bearing upon the issues presented in the appeal. Each party shall bear his, her, its, or their own attorneys' fees, regardless of the outcome of the appeal. 
(5)  The arbitrator shall consider relevant evidence presented during the hearing and provide a written decision on the appeal to the city, with a copy to the city clerk, and the appellant within one business day after the close of the hearing. The time identified in this section for providing the arbitrator's decision may be extended only by consent of the city and the appellant and such an extension shall not affect or require a delay in a scheduled time for opening of bids for any public works project. Failure by the arbitrator to render a timely decision shall be deemed a denial of the appeal. 
(6)  The arbitrator's decision shall be final.

(1)  The disposition of the remainder of a larger parcel which was acquired and used in part for street purposes; 
(2)  Acquisitions, dispositions, or abandonments for street widening; or 
(3)  Alignment projects, provided such dispositions for street purposes, acquisitions, dispositions, or abandonments for street widening or alignment projects are of a minor nature.

(c)  The disposition of real property shall be by competitive proposals unless the city council determines that disposition without competitive proposals is in the best interests of the city.

(c)  The city manager shall approve the disposition of commodities and/or equipment when the estimated value of an individual item is less than $2,000.00; however, city council approval is required if the value is equal to or exceeds $2,000.00.

CHAPTER 3.28 - PUBLIC FACILITIES REIMBURSEMENT FEE 
 
3.28.010 - Purpose. 
The city council has determined to prepare a public facilities element of the Lincoln general plan pursuant to Government Code Section 65303 and an environmental impact report and financing plan for the public facilities element (hereinafter referred to collectively as the program) to provide for the public health, safety, and welfare and the orderly physical development of the city. The city has entered into a reimbursement agreement dated as of December 13, 1988, to aid in financing preparation of the program. Under this agreement three developers have advanced to the city the full cost of preparation of the program and the city has agreed to reimburse to them that portion of the amounts advanced that exceeds their proportionate fair share of the cost. The city council determines that a reimbursement fee is needed to spread the cost of preparation of the program to all benefitted properties and to meet the city's reimbursement obligation. In establishing the fee described in the following sections the city council has found the fee to be consistent with the city's general plan and, pursuant to Government Code Section 65913.2, has considered the effects of the fee with respect to the city's housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan. 
(Ord. 515B §1, 1988)  
3.28.020 - Public facilities element reimbursement fee. 
A public facilities element reimbursement is established on the annexation of territory into the city. The city council shall, in a council resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fee, describe the benefit area on which the fee shall be imposed, describe the program and its estimated cost, describe the reasonable relationship between the fee and the annexation to which it shall apply, and set forth the time of payment. As described in the fee resolution, the reimbursement fee shall be paid as a condition of submitting an application to the city for annexation of the territory to which it applies to the city. On an annual basis, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the preparation of the program and whether the fee is still needed. 
(Ord. 515B §2, 1988)  
3.28.030 - Limited use of fee. 
The funds raised by payment of the reimbursement fee shall be placed in a separate interest-bearing account for the benefit of those developers advancing to the city the cost of preparation of the program (the "reimbursement fee account") and such funding, along with all accrued interest earnings on the funds, shall be used solely to reimburse the developers as provided in the reimbursement agreement. 
(Ord. 515B §3, 1988)  
3.28.040 - Fee waiver. 
The fee established in this chapter shall be waived for any applicant for annexation who is a party to the reimbursement agreement under the terms and conditions and as provided for in the reimbursement agreement. 
(Ord. 515B §4, 1988)  
3.28.050 - Fee adjustment. 
Any applicant for annexation who is subject to the fee established in this chapter may apply for a reduction or waiver of the fee based on a lesser degree or complete absence of any reasonable relationship between the annexation and the benefits of the program to that annexation and the amount of the fee. The application shall be in writing and filed with the director of community development concurrently with the annexation application, accompanied by a fee in the amount of $250.00 to cover the cost of the hearing. The application shall state in detail the factual basis for the reduction or waiver request. The city council shall consider the application at a noticed public hearing held no later than 60 days thereafter. The city council shall approve the application in whole or in part only upon finding that due to specific and specified factors particular to the proposed annexation that the information in the program is not fully beneficial or applicable to the proposed annexation. The decision of the city council shall be final. The procedure and hearing requirements of this section shall not apply to a fee waiver under Section 3.28.040. 
(Ord. 515B §5, 1988)  
CHAPTER 3.30 - DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED PROPERTY 
 
3.30.010 - Disposition of unclaimed property. 
(a)  Any unclaimed property not governed by statute, after being held 90 days from the date the owner was notified by letter to claim the property, may be sold at public auction by the director of public safety, or his designee, provided that notice of such sale shall be given by the director at least five days prior to the date of sale in the newspaper. 
(b)  Unclaimed property that is needed for public use, need not be sold and if the unclaimed property is of the type that would not normally be sold at auction, it shall be destroyed. 
(c)  Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 217, toys or bicycles which have been unclaimed for at least 60 days, instead of being sold at public auction, may be turned over to those organizations as provided for in Welfare and Institutions Code Section 217.

(2)  Establish such reasonable rules and procedures, designed to promote the utilization of such public, educational and/or governmental access programming and subject to the approval of the city council, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, whereby the licensee shall accept and cablecast such public, educational and/or governmental access programming upon the cable television system as shall be provided to the licensee by such persons and entities. 
(3)  Make all reasonable efforts to coordinate the cablecasting of public, educational and/or governmental access programming upon the cable television system at the same time and upon the same channel designations as such programming is cablecast upon other cable television systems with the city.

(a)  A licensee shall provide a connection of its basic tier of video service (including, without limitation, all PEG channels) to every local governmental facility (whether county, city, school district, or special district) without cost to the government owner or operator of the facility. This requirement shall apply to any newly-constructed or newly-acquired facility during the term of the license, and licensee shall provide connections to such newly-constructed or acquired facilities within 90 days of a notice to do so from the city. The service required by this section shall be provided without cost during the entire term of the license. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the licensee from agreeing to provide additional services and connections to those same facilities. 
(b)  In the event that licensee shall build a network capable of providing high speed access to the Internet or other nonvideo services, licensee shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide such services to every local governmental facility in the city without cost to the government owner or operator of the facility.

5.36.530 - Privacy. 
Subject to federal and state law, each licensee shall operate in such a manner as to protect the privacy of its customers, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Neither the licensee nor any other person, agency, or entity shall tap, or arrange for the tapping or monitoring of any cable, line, signal input device, or customer outlet or receiver for any purpose whatsoever, except that the licensee may conduct tests of the functioning of the system where necessary in order to ensure proper maintenance of the system and to collect performance data for agencies regulating the quality of signals, and the licensee may conduct system-wide or individually addressed "sweeps" for the sole purpose of verifying system integrity (including individual security system integrity), controlling return path transmissions, billing for pay services, or collecting aggregate data on viewing patterns by channel. 
"Tapping" means observing a communications signal exchange where the observer is neither of the communicating parties, whether the exchange is observed by visual, aural or electronic means, for any purpose whatsoever. The provision of interactive service shall not be construed to be "tapping" or "monitoring" under this section. 
(2)  The licensee shall not place in any dwelling unit or other facility any equipment capable of two-way communications without the written consent of the customer, and shall not utilize the two-way communications capability of the system for customer surveillance of any kind without the written consent of the customer specifying how the data collected will be used and by whom. Tenants who occupy premises connected by the CATV system shall be deemed to be customers within the meaning of this section regardless of who actually pays for the service. The written consents shall be, and shall show on their face that they are, revocable by the customer at any time by written communication mailed by the customer to the licensee. No penalty shall be invoked for a customer's failure to provide a written consent or for his or her revocation thereof, and all written consents shall so state on their face. The licensee shall not make such written consent a condition precedent to receipt by a customer of noninteractive service. The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to require consent as a condition precedent to system-wide or individually addressed "sweeps" for the sole purpose of verifying system integrity, controlling return-path transmissions, billing for pay services, or collecting aggregate data on viewing patterns by channel. 
(3)  No cable, line, wire, amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment associated with CATV services shall be attached to any residence or other private property without first securing the written permission of the owner or tenant of the property. If such permission is later lawfully revoked, whether by the original or subsequent owner or tenant, the licensee shall remove forthwith all of the equipment and promptly restore the property to its original condition. The licensee shall perform all installations in a workmanlike manner and shall be responsible for any damage to residences or other property caused by the installation. 
(4)  No licensee or officer, agent or employee thereof shall sell, or otherwise make available, lists of the names and addresses of its customers, or any list which identifies, by name or otherwise individual subscriber viewing habits, to any person, agency, or entity for any purpose whatsoever except that the licensee shall, upon request, provide lists of names and addresses of its customers to authorized representatives of the city so that the city may enforce the conditions of any license or the provisions of this chapter. Names and addresses of customers within the possession of the city shall not be subject to public inspection or review. 
(5)  A licensee may release the number of customers, but only as a total number and as a percentage of the potential customers within the city or any given area within the city. When indicating the number of customers viewing a particular channel, a licensee shall indicate only the total number of customers viewing during the relevant time and, the percentage of all customers which they represent, but not the identity of any customer. 
(6)  No polls or other two-way responses of customers shall be conducted whether for commercial purposes, in connection with community use, or otherwise unless the program of which the poll is a part contains an explicit disclosure of the nature, purpose, and prospective use of the results of the poll. The licensee shall supervise and monitor all polls in which responses are received through the CATV system, and shall adopt and enforce measures which ensure that personally identifiable information concerning a customer, including his or her viewing habits and response or responses to the inquiry or inquiries, is not received by any third party, including the party sponsoring the poll. 
(7)  A licensee shall not tabulate any test results, nor permit the use of the system of such tabulation, which would reveal the commercial product preferences or opinions of individual customers, members of their families or their invitees, licensees or employees, without advance written authorization by the customers. 
(Ord. 747B §3(part), 2003)  
5.36.540 - Nondiscrimination.

Not later than the date of each payment, each licensee shall file with the city manager a written statement signed under penalty of perjury by an officer of the licensee which identifies in detail the sources and amounts of gross revenues received by a licensee during the quarter for which payment is made. 
(b)  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this section.

Unless a development is determined by the city to be exempt or is granted a waiver, the following design standards shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites. When a site development plan is submitted that is a redevelopment project as defined in Section 8.60.030 of this chapter, decisions on permitting and on-site storm water requirements shall be determined by the city. This criterion is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the city. 
(1)  A storm water management plan must be prepared and submitted for approval by the city that indicates how the design standards identified in this section will be complied with. The plan must illustrate sufficient engineering analysis to show that the proposed storm water management measures are capable of controlling runoff from the site in compliance with a method deemed acceptable by the city. 
(2)  Post-development peak storm water runoff discharge rates shall not exceed the estimated pre-development rate for developments where the increased peak storm water discharge rate will result in increased potential for downstream erosion.

CHAPTER 13.05 - CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL 
 
13.05.010 - Purpose. 
(a)  The purposes of this chapter are: 
(1)  to protect the city water system against actual or potential cross-connections by isolating within premises, contamination or pollution that may occur because of undiscovered or unauthorized cross-connections on premises; 
(2)  to eliminate existing connections between the city water system and other sources of water that are not approved as safe and potable for human consumption; 
(3)  to prevent the making of cross-connections in the future; and 
(4)  to encourage the exclusive use of public water systems as sources of water supply. 
(b)  It is the intent of this chapter to recognize that there are varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of protection should be commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
(Ord. 540B §1(part), 1990)  
13.05.020 - Definitions. 
The meanings of terms used in this chapter are as follows: 
"Air-gap separation" means a physical separation between the discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or nonpressure receiving vessel. An "approved air-gap separation" shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the overflow rim of the receiving vessel and in no case shall be less than one inch. 
"Approved," as herein used in reference to backflow prevention assemblies, means approval by the city. 
"Atmospheric vacuum breaker (nonpressure)" means backflow prevention device containing a shutoff valve followed by a valve body containing a float-check, a check seat and an air inlet port. 
"Auxiliary water system" means any water supply on or available to a customer's premises other than the city water system. 
"Backflow" means the undesirable reversal of the flow of water or any mixture of water and other liquid, gas or other substance into the distribution pipes of the city water system from any source or sources. 
"Certified backflow prevention device tester" means a person who has been certified by the city as having the necessary training and competence to test backflow prevention assemblies. 
"Cross-connection" means any unprotected actual or potential connection or structural arrangement between any part of the city water system used or intended to supply water for human consumption, and any source or system containing used water, industrial fluid, gas or other substance that is not or cannot be approved as safe, wholesome and potable for human consumption. 
"Double check valve assembly" means a backflow prevention device incorporating two, single, independently acting check valves, a shutoff valve at each end of the device and necessary appurtenances for testing as required by the city. 
"Pressure vacuum breaker assembly" means a backflow prevention device incorporating one or two independently operating, loaded check valve(s), an independently operating loaded air inlet valve, a shutoff valve at each end of the device and necessary appurtenances for testing as required by the city. 
"Reduced pressure principle assembly" means a backflow prevention device incorporating two independently acting check valves, a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure relief valve, a shutoff valve at each end of the device and necessary appurtenances for testing as required by the city. 
"Service connection" means the point at which the city water system piping ends and the water system piping of the customer begins. If a meter is installed as part of the city water system, then the term "service connection" means the downstream end of the meter. 
(Ord. 540B §1(part), 1990)  
13.05.030 - Protection required. 
(a)  Protection shall be required at each service connection from the city water system that supplies water to premises having an auxiliary water system. 
(b)  Protection shall be required at each service connection from the city water system that supplies water to premises on which any substance is or may be handled in such a manner as to permit entry into the city water system, including water originating from the city water system which is or may be subjected to deterioration in sanitary quality. 
(c)  Protection shall be required at each service connection to any premises that has cross-connections unless such cross-connections are abated to the satisfaction of the city. 
(Ord. 540B §1(part), 1990)  
13.05.040 - Type of protection. 
The type of protection required shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard. In determining the degree of hazard and the type of protection required, the following criteria shall be issued: 
(1)  At each service connection to any premises where there exists an auxiliary water system with no known cross-connections, the city water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. 
(2)  At each service connection to any premises on which there is an auxiliary water system where cross-connections are known to exist, the city water system shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. 
(3)  At each service connection to any premises on which an objectionable but nonhazardous substance is, or may be, handled in such a manner as to permit entry into a city water system, the city water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve backflow prevention assembly or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. 
(4)  At each service connection to any premises on which any hazardous substance is or may be handled in such a manner as to permit entry into the city water system, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation. The air-gap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock and all piping between the service cock and any receiving vessel shall be visible. If these conditions cannot reasonably be met, the city water system shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure principal backflow prevention assembly, provided that this alternative is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations adopted per Section 13.05.200 of this chapter. 
(5)  At each service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage pumping station, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation. The air-gap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock and all piping between the service cock and any receiving vessel shall be visible. If these conditions cannot reasonably be met, the city water system shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, provided that this alternative is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations adopted per Section 13.05.200 of this chapter. 
(6)  A swivel-ell connection is authorized cross-connection control for non-dual plumbed systems. Swivel-ell connections shall not be used on dual plumbed systems. A dual plumbed system is a system that utilizes separate piping systems for reclaimed water and potable water within a facility and where the reclaimed water is used for either of the following purposes: to serve plumbing outlets (excluding fire suppression systems) within a building, or outdoor landscape irrigation at individual residences. 
A swivel-ell connection shall be designed to preclude the simultaneous use of both potable and reclaimed water sources to supply a distribution system at the same time. The swivel-ell may be manually switched between the reclaimed water source connection and the potable water source connection to supply the use area's distribution system. In no case shall it be acceptable for the potable water supply to be directly connected to a reclaimed water supply. The public services department shall document that all site specific conditions have been satisfied prior to the use and connection of a swivel-ell connection. The public services department may at any time require installation of a permanent air-gap separation between the potable water supply and the reclaimed water distribution system. 
The following is required for all reclaimed water projects, including those that have a swivel-ell connection: 
a.  No simultaneous use of the potable water supply and the reclaimed water supply shall be allowed in the same distribution system. 
b.  Prior to construction of any facilities, written approval shall be obtained from the public services department. 
c.  Only disinfected tertiary reclaimed water is used. 
d.  Each reclaimed water distribution system may only be supplied from a single reclaimed water feed line. There shall be no other inter-connections between the reclaimed water distribution system and potable water system within the use area or facility. 
e.  The swivel-ell connection (which includes the reclaimed water service, potable water service, and the service riser to the facility or use area) must be located above ground, color coded in accordance with the Health and Safety Code Section 116815, and have appropriate signs. Security precautions must be provided (e.g. locked gate valves, warning signs, etc.) to prevent interconnections, vandalism, and unauthorized use. The city shall inspect each location on a minimum annual basis to verify that a switchover has not occurred without the purveyor's approval. Meters must be provided on both connections and records of water use maintained. 
f.  The potable water service connection must be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly (RP). The swivel-ell connection must be located downstream of the RP assembly. The need for on-site backflow protection must also be evaluated. 
g.  To avoid simultaneously using both sources, swivel-ell connections must be designed such that a tee connection, or other prefabricated mechanical appurtenances, cannot readily be substituted for the swivel-ell. The reclaimed water and potable water service connections should not approach the use area service riser at an angle of 180°. 
h.  The RP on the potable water supply line must be tested in accordance with Title 17, Section 7605 immediately prior to a switchover from the reclaimed water supply to the potable water supply. The completed test report must be sent to the Regional Board prior to activation. 
i.  The public services department and regional board must be notified within 24 hours of each switchover. 
j.  The city shall supervise the switchover and activation of the potable water service; and subsequent deactivation.

CHAPTER 13.34 - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION CONTROL  
Article I. - General Provisions 
 
13.34.010 - Findings of fact. 
The city council adopts this chapter based upon the following findings: 
(1)  The Federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") provides for the regulation and reduction of pollutants discharged into waters of the United States by extending National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") requirements to stormwater and urban runoff discharges into the City of Lincoln's ("city's") stormwater conveyance system. 
(2)  Stormwater flows from individual properties to the municipal storm drain system and then ultimately discharges to Waters of the United States. 
(3)  The city has obtained permit coverage under the Phase II Small NPDES Permit. Under the provisions of the general permit for the discharge of stormwater from small municipal separate storm sewer systems ("MS4s") ("Phase II Small NPDES Permit"), the city is required to possess the necessary legal authority and implement appropriate procedures to regulate the discharge of pollutants and nonstormwater discharges into the city's stormwater drainage system. 
(4)  The Phase II Small NPDES Permit requires the city to regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by stormwater discharges by any user, to prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4, and to establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this ordinance 
(Ord. No. 894B , § 1, 12-9-2014)  
13.34.020 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to ensure the health, safety, and general welfare of citizens, and to protect and enhance water quality of watercourses and water bodies in a manner pursuant to and consistent with the federal CWA by reducing pollutants in stormwater discharges associated with the municipal storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable and by controlling the introduction of pollutants to the municipal storm drainage system.

(Ord. No. 926B , § 6, 11-15-2016)  
15.04.250 - Findings. 
The city council finds that the regulations enacted by this chapter and the modifications to the California Construction Code Standards are reasonably necessary because of local climatic, topographical, or geographical conditions present within the city of Lincoln. Pursuant to California Health and Safety Code, Section 18941.5, the city of Lincoln has made certain modifications based on these climatic, topographical and geographical conditions as follows: 
Average yearly rainfall for the city is approximately 1622 inches. This rainfall normally occurs from October to April. During the summer months, there is generally no measurable precipitation. Temperatures for this dry period average from 80 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and are frequently accompanied by light to gusty northerly winds. The city is surrounded by several hundred acres of grassland, which in conjunction with the dry and sometimes windy climate creates a hazardous fire situation that has led to extensive grass and brush fires in recent years. Over the past decade, the city has grown in population and continues development extending from the urban core into these grassland areas and at some locations, oak tree covered areas. In these areas of the city, wind-driven fires could lead to severe consequences, as has been the case on several occasions in similar areas of the state. 
Uniquely for a city of its size, the city is bisected by several topographical features, including two ravines (Auburn Ravine and Markham Ravine), one railroad line (Union Pacific), and State Highway 65 and State Highway 193. As a result, the city is divided into four different areas, including the East-side (east of the railroad), West-side (west of the railroad), Lincoln Hills (south of Auburn Ravine), and Twelve Bridges (south of Twelve Bridges Drive). Traffic between these areas is channeled into several thoroughfares which must cross the creeks, railroad tracks, and state highways by means of bridges or at grade crossings (which are sometimes blocked by trains with only one overpass). Heavy traffic congestion on the city's major streets already acts as a barrier to timely response for fire equipment and emergency services. In the event of an accident or other emergency at one of the main points of intersection between the road, creek, or railroad sections, portions of the city could become isolated or emergency response times could be sufficiently slowed so as to increase the risk of substantial injury or damage. 
These local climatic, topographical and geographical conditions could potentially create serious concerns regarding the potential for an explosive fire situation and the inability of the city to provide a rapid emergency services response to various areas of the city. Additionally, there are areas of the city that have larger homes located within their confines and private gated areas where homes are further apart. As a result, it is necessary to mitigate these issues by amending the California Residential, Building and Fire Codes as provided for in California Health and Safety Code Sections 17958 et seq., requiring installation of horn/strobe devices for townhouses and one- and two-family dwellings during activation of the code-required dwelling sprinkler system. 
Failure to enact this chapter with the amendments outlined could place the residents of the city of Lincoln in a condition which would be perilous to their health and safety and therefore, pursuant to California Government Code Section 65961(a)(1), the requirements for horn/strobe devices during activation of the code-required dwelling sprinkler system as required by this chapter shall be imposed as a condition to the issuance of a building permit for townhouses and one- and two-family dwellings pursuant to the requirements of the California Building and Residential Codes of the California Building Standards.

15.05.020 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter: 
"Electronic submittal" means the utilization of electronic e-mail, submittal via the internet or facsimile. 
"Reasonable restrictions" on a solar energy system are those restrictions that do not significantly increase the cost of the system or significantly decrease its efficiency or specified performance, or that allow for an alternative system of comparable cost, efficiency, and energy conservation benefits. 
"Restrictions that do not significantly increase the cost of the system or decrease its efficiency or specified performance" means: 
(1)  For water heater systems or solar swimming pool heating systems: an amount exceeding ten percent of the cost of the system, but in no case more than $1,000.00, or decreasing the efficiency of the solar energy system by an amount exceeding ten percent, as originally specified and proposed. 
(2)  For photovoltaic systems: an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 over the system cost as originally specified and proposed, or a decrease in system efficiency of an amount exceeding ten percent as originally specified and proposed. 
"Small residential rooftop solar energy system" means all of the following: 
(1)  A solar energy system that is no larger than ten kilowatts alternating current nameplate rating or 30 kilowatts thermal. 
(2)  A solar energy system that conforms to all applicable state fire, structural, electrical, and other building codes as adopted or amended by the city, and all state and city health and safety standards. 
(3)  A solar energy system that is installed on a single- or two-family dwelling. 
(4)  A solar panel or module array that does not exceed the maximum legal building height as defined by the city. 
"Solar energy system" means either of the following: 
(1)  Any solar collector or other solar energy device whose primary purpose is to provide for the collection, storage, and distribution of solar energy for space heating, space cooling, electric generation, or water heating. 
(2)  Any structural design feature of a building, whose primary purpose is to provide for the collection, storage, and distribution of solar energy for electricity generation, space heating or cooling, or for water heating. 
"Specific, adverse impact" means a significant, quantifiable, direct, unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, and written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. 
(Ord. No. 909B , § 2(Exh. A), 10-13-2015)

CHAPTER 15.32 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[5] 
Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 841B, §§ 1, 2, adopted Oct. 13, 2009, repealed Ch. 15.32 in its entirety and enacted a new Ch. 15.32 to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 15.32, §§ 15.32.01015.32.240, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 499B § 1(part), adopted in 1987; Ord. 640B §§ 18, adopted in 1996; Ord. 771B §§ 14, adopted in 2004. 
 
Article I. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods 
 
15.32.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Lincoln does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations based on the California Model Floodplain Management Ordinance for Non-Coastal Communities, December 2006. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
15.32.020 - Finding of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards, which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
15.32.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within floodprone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
15.32.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
Article II. - Definitions 
 
5.32.050 - Interpretation.

(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
15.32.060 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings: 
"A zone" - See "Special flood hazard area." 
"Accessory structure" means a structure that is either: 
(1)  Solely for the parking of no more than 2 cars; or 
(2)  A small, low cost shed for limited storage, less than 150 square feet and $1,500.00 in value. 
"Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
"Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. 
"Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
"Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this ordinance. 
"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
"Area of special flood hazard" - See "Special flood hazard area." 
"Base flood" means a flood which has a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this ordinance. 
"Base flood elevation" (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade - i.e., below ground level - on all sides. 
"Building" - See "Structure". 
"Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before December 8, 1981. 
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for receiving the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
"Flood", flooding" or "floodwater" means: 
(1)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
(2)  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
"Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
"Flood hazard zone" means an area subject to flooding that is delineated as either a special hazard area or an area of moderate hazard on an official flood insurance rate map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The identification of flood hazard zones does not imply that areas outside the flood hazard zones, or uses permitted within flood hazard zones, will be free from flooding or flood damage. 
"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the FIRM, the FBFM, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see "Flooding." 
"Floodplain administrator" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes such state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water, and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Article VI of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Hardship" as related to Article VI of this ordinance means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
"Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
(1)  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The flood opening standard in subsection 15.32.160(c); 
b.  The anchoring standards in subsection 15.32.180(a); 
c.  The construction materials and method standards in subsection 15.32.180(b); 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.32.190. 
(2)  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent. 
"Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
"Moderate hazard area" means an area in the floodplain subject to a half-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or federal insurance rate map (FIRM) as zone B or X (shaded). 
"New construction" means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after December 8, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after December 8, 1981. 
"Non-urban area" or "not urbanizing area" means developed an area or area outside a developed area in which there are fewer than 10,000 residents. Lincoln is an urban area and does not constitute any non-urban or urbanizing area. 
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
"One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" - see "Base Flood." 
"Program deficiency" means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. 
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Article VI of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Sheet flow area" - see "Area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, or AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, as well as a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means: 
(1)  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damaged occurred; or 
(2)  Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive loss." 
"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "Start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement to correct existing violations or existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Urban area" means a developed area in which there are 10,000 residents or more. All lands within the city limits of Lincoln are considered an urban area. 
"Urban level of flood protection" means the level of protection that is necessary to withstand flooding that has a 1-in-200 chance of occurring in any given year using criteria consistent with, or developed by, the California Department of Water Resources. "Urban level of flood protection" shall not mean shallow flooding or flooding from local drainage that meets the criteria of the national Federal Emergency Management Agency standard of flood protection. 
"Urbanizing area" means a developed area or an area outside a developed area that is planned or anticipated to have 10,000 residents or more within the next ten years. Lincoln is an urban area and does not consist of any non-urban or urbanizing areas. 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
15.32.120 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Lincoln, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
15.32.130 - Severability. 
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
Article IV. - Administration 
 
15.32.140 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The city engineer is hereby appointed to administer, implement and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009)  
15.32.150 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Permit Review. 
a.  Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
b.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
c.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
d.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Lincoln; and 
e.  All letters of map revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
(2)  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
a.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions about Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value." 
b.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
(3)  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.32.080, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article V. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
(4)  Notification of Other Agencies. 
a.  Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse: 
1.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
2.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
3.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
b.  Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations: 
1.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
2.  All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries: 
Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
(5)  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
a.  Certification required by subsection 15.32.180(3)a. and Section 15.32.210 (lowest floor elevations); 
b.  Certification required by subsection 15.32.180(3)b. (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
c.  Certification required by subsection 15.32.180(3)c. (wet floodproofing standard); 
d.  Certification of elevation required by subsection 15.32.200(a)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
e.  Certification required by subsection 15.32.230(2) (floodway encroachments); and 
f.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(6)  Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.32.170. 
(7)  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.32.090. 
(8)  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
(9)  Planning. Assure city's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
(10)  Non-conversion of Enclosed Areas Below the Lowest Floor. To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant with the floodplain management ordinance in effect at the time of conversion, the floodplain administrator shall: 
a.  Determine which applicants for new construction and/or substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are five feet or higher; 
b.  Enter into a "Non-Conversion Agreement for Construction within Flood Hazard Areas" or equivalent with the city of Lincoln.

Article VII. - Variance Procedure[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 913B , § 3(Exh. A), adopted June 28, 2016, renumbered Art. VI, §§ 15.32.24015.32.260, as Art. VII, §§ 15.32.28015.32.300. 
 
15.32.280 - Natures of variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this article of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 841B, § 2, 10-13-2009; Ord. No. 913B , § 3(Exh. A), 6-28-2016)  
15.32.290 - Conditions for variance. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles IV and V of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Article II of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
(e)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.

Title 16 - SIGNS  
CHAPTER 16.01 - GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS 
 
16.01.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The city council finds as follows: 
(1)  The purpose of this title is to encourage signs which are integrated with, and harmonious to, the buildings and sites which they occupy, to eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays, to preserve and improve the appearance of the city as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade, and to restrict signs which increase the probability of accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision. 
(2)  The regulations established by this title are intended to appropriately limit the placement, type, size, and number of signs allowed within the city, and to require the proper maintenance of signs. By adopting this title, the city intends to regulate signs on the basis of location, relationship to land uses, illumination, motion, size, height, orientation, separation, safety of physical structures, and the public need for functional information. 
(3)  Intent as to public forum. The city declares its intent that not all city property shall function as a public forum, unless some specific portion of city property is named herein as a public forum of one particular type; in such case, the declaration as to public forum type shall apply strictly to, and only to the specified area and for the specified time period. 
(4)  The purposes of these limitations and requirements are to: 
a.  Safeguard and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and advance the goals, policies, and strategies of the city's general plan; 
b.  Reduce or avoid traffic and/or safety hazards to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians, caused by visual distractions and obstructions, or to impede their access; 
c.  Protect and enhance the character and setting of the city against visual blight by preventing a proliferation of signs that will detract from, and obscure, the scenic qualities of the city and its individual buildings and neighborhoods; 
d.  Promote the aesthetic and environmental values of the community by providing for signs that do not impair the attractiveness of the city as a place to live, work, and shop; 
e.  Promote the public health, safety, and welfare by setting reasonable, nonarbitrary, and nondiscriminatory standards and procedures to facilitate the improvement and protection of the environment by prohibiting the misuse and/or proliferation of signs. 
f.  This title sets forth standards and minimum requirements to safeguard life, safety, property, and public welfare by regulating the size, height, construction, location, electrification, operation, and maintenance of all signs and sign structures exposed to public view within the city. The pleasing visual appearance and traffic safety of the city cannot be preserved and achieved by measures less restrictive than the procedures and standards of this title. 
(Ord. No. 897B , § 2(Exh. A), 3-24-2015)  
16.01.020 - Enforcement authority. 
(a)  The community development director or designee (hereinafter known as "director") for purposes of this title is authorized and directed to enforce all provisions of this title. 
(b)  Any violations of this title shall be subject to enforcement remedies, penalties, and abatement provided by the City's Municipal Code, including, without limitation, Chapters 1.16 through 1.18, inclusive, and Chapter 8.08, and state and federal law. Each sign and each day a violation exists is considered a separate violation when applying criminal, civil or administrative penalties. Except where necessary for the immediate protection of the public peace, health, safety, or welfare, no enforcement action shall be taken under this title unless the person alleged to be violating the provision of this title is given not less than five days' written notice to cease the violation. Such notice shall be given in person or by mail to the record owner of the property upon which the violation exists. 
(c)  In adopting this title, the city acts in its proprietary capacity as to city property, as defined herein, within the city. This title is adopted in accordance with the freedom afforded to cities pursuant to the city's general and police powers; California Constitution Article XI, Section 7; California Government Code Sections 65000 et seq., 65850(b), 38774, and 38775; Business and Professions Code Sections 5200 et seq., 5230, and 5490 et seq.; Penal Code Section 556; and other applicable state laws. The provisions of this title constitute the "city sign ordinance." 
(d)  Any person dissatisfied by an act or determination of an official of the city relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this title may appeal such act or determination to the city planning commission, and thereafter the city council, as provided for under Chapter 18.94. The fee for such appeals shall be established by resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 897B , § 2(Exh. A), 3-24-2015)  
16.01.030 - General principals governing sign regulations. 
(a)  Regulatory Interpretations. The city shall apply this title in a content-neutral manner. The noncommunicative aspects of all signs shall comply with the regulations and standards set forth in this title. "Noncommunicative aspects" includes regulations that do not relate to the content of the sign, including, for example, the time, place, manner, location, size, height, illumination, spacing, and orientation of signs. 
(b)  Planned Development Districts/Sign Criteria. In addition to the sign regulations set forth in this title, each planned development and other areas of the city with approved sign criteria, may have additional or separate regulations for signs in its plan area. Where those planned development districts do not regulate signage, these provisions shall apply. 
(c)  Substitution of Noncommercial Message. In each instance and under the same conditions to which this title permits any sign, a sign containing an ideological, religious, or other noncommercial message shall be permitted wherever a commercial message is permitted. 
(d)  Content Neutral. It is the city's policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner that is content neutral as to noncommercial messages which are within the protections of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the corollary provisions of the California Constitution. 
(e)  Property Owner's Consent. No sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner(s) of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed. 
(f)  Legal Nature of Signage Rights and Duties. As to all signs attached to real or personal property, the signage rights, duties and obligations arising from this title attach to and travel with the land or other property on which a sign is mounted or displayed. 
(g)  Severance. If any section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion, or provision of this title is held invalid or unconstitutional, or unenforceable, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any other section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion, or provision of this title which can be given effect without the invalid portion. In adopting this title, the city council affirmatively declares that it would have approved and adopted the title even without any portion which may be held invalid or unconstitutional, or unenforceable. 
(Ord. No. 897B , § 2(Exh. A), 3-24-2015)  
16.01.040 - Applicability; permit required.

(c)  Signs Must be Permitted or Exempted. Unless specifically authorized by this title or other applicable law, no signs may be displayed on city property, except in or on a traditional public forum or a forum so designated by the city, and in accordance with this title. Any unauthorized sign posted on city property may be summarily removed by the city as a trespass and a public nuisance.

The cost of removal and of any damage to city property resulting from the placement or removal of a sign under this subsection shall be charged to the person who placed the sign or caused the sign to be placed.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1 of the Government Code of the State of California) (the "Vesting Tentative Map Statute"). The purpose of this chapter is to establish appropriate local procedures for the implementation of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute. 
To accomplish this purpose, the regulations contained in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. 
(Ord. 644B §1(part), 1997)  
17.18.020 - Consistency. 
No land shall be approved and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the general plan or any applicable specific plan or which is not permitted by Title 18 (Zoning) or any other applicable provisions of this code. A subdivider may file an application for a vesting tentative map for a subdivision which is inconsistent with the general plan and a specific plan if said application is accompanied with an application to amend the general plan and/or specific plan that would eliminate the inconsistency. 
(Ord. 644B §1(part), 1997)  
17.18.030 - Definitions. 
A "vesting tentative map" means a tentative map for a subdivision that shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "vesting tentative map" at the time it is filed in accordance with Section 17.18.040 and is thereafter processed in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
(Ord. 644B §1(part), 1997)  
17.18.040 - Filing and processing. 
A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in the Lincoln Municipal Code for a tentative map except as hereinafter provided in this chapter. 
At the time a vesting tentative map is filed the subdivider shall also supply the following information: 
(1)  Preliminary utility, sewer, water, storm drain and road plans; 
(2)  Preliminary grading plans; 
(3)  Information on the uses to which the parcels will be put; 
(4)  Traffic circulation and impact; 
(5)  Flood control and impact; 
(6)  Information as specified in Government Code Sections 6596.5(d), (f) and 65850.2; 
(7)  Any other matters deemed necessary by the director of community development. 
(Ord. 644B §1(part), 1997)  
17.18.050 - Fees. 
Upon filing a vesting tentative map the subdivider shall pay fees required by either city ordinance or resolution for filing and processing of a tentative map. 
(Ord. 644B §1(part), 1997)  
17.18.060 - Expiration. 
The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by the Lincoln Municipal Code for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map and those provisions for expiration and extension set forth in Government Code Section 66452.6. 
(Ord. 644B §1(part), 1997)  
17.18.070 - Rights of a vesting tentative map. 
(a)  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer the rights as provided for in Government Code Section 66498.1. These rights shall apply to residential, commercial and industrial parcels. 
(b)  The rights conferred by a vesting tentative map shall continue for a two-year period after the recording of the final map. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, the two-year initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. All of said final maps must be recorded within the time period set forth in Section 17.18.060 or the vesting tentative map approval shall expire for those maps for which final maps are not timely recorded. 
(c)  The two-year initial time period set forth in subsection B of this section shall be automatically extended for any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit, if one is required, or for any required design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds 30 days from the date a complete application is filed. 
(d)  A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the expiration of the initial two-year time period.

(Ord. 324B §6-1 (part), 1977)  
17.28.020 - Restriction of density, timing or sequence of development.

(Ord. 324B §6-1(part), 1977)  
17.28.030 - Zoning conformity. 
Except as provided in Sections 17.28.210, 17.28.220, 17.28.230 and 17.28.250, which shall govern in the case of any conflict with provisions of the zoning ordinance, all subdivisions shall result in lots which comply with the requirements set forth for the particular uses in the zoning ordinance.

17.28.040 - Flood damage prevention ordinance conformity. 
All subdivisions, and the improvements required in connection therewith, located within areas of special flood hazard as designated in the flood insurance study for the city of Lincoln, shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 15.32, Flood Damage Prevention. If a provision of this title and Chapter 15.32 conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent requirements or restrictions shall prevail.

Each route of access to collector streets or major streets and its point of connection therewith shall be adequate to safely accommodate the composition and volume of vehicular traffic generated by the land uses it serves. In determining the adequacy of a route of access, the deployment of fire equipment or other emergency services shall be considered by the commission and the council. A tentative map which makes use of local streets which pass through a predominantly residential neighborhood as a route of access to industrial, commercial or other subdivisions, generating traffic which would conflict with a residential character of the neighborhood, may be denied. 
(Ord. 324B §6-10, 1977)

When a street is temporarily dead-ended, a barricade or temporary turning area or temporary connection to another street shall be required unless waived in writing by the commission upon recommendation of the city engineer. The commission or council may require, at the end of a dead-end street, that a turnaround be provided when the future extension of the street is remote.

CHAPTER 18.29 - A-D AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT 
 
18.29.000 - Purpose. 
Well-located and well-composed agricultural land is a major natural resource that cannot be made nor increased. This type of land is the source of essential food stuffs and fibers. An important aspect to this resource are lands within the city that are economically restricted to grazing and animal husbandry due to location, geological formation and chemical/organic composition. It is important to preserve both productive agricultural lands and grazing lands. The purpose, therefore, of this classification is to accomplish this objective by holding to high minimum area standards, permitting only such uses as are related to agricultural production or are similar thereto and by discouraging the encroachment of urban type development and especially that which would be marginal in character and disruptive of sound long range planning and economic factors. Reasonable consideration, however, shall be given by the city to rezoning of land in this classification at such time as the orderly development of the city and the general welfare necessitate development of portions of this land for residential and related uses.

b.  Any open-air storage of hay, straw, shavings or similar organic materials shall maintain a distance of not less than 35 feet from any boundary property line, and a distance of not less than 45 feet from any building containing a dwelling unit or accessory living quarters on the same premises; 
(4)  Greenhouses, when incidental to agricultural uses on premises; 
(5)  Marketing of products on the premises, provided: 
a.  Only one stand shall be permitted on the premises and such stand shall contain not more than 500 square feet of floor area, and shall not be located in any required yard or open space on the premises; 
(6)  Pasturing and grazing; 
(7)  Public stables and riding academies provided: 
a.  Any stable or barn shall not be located closer than 75 feet to any boundary property line, or to any building containing a dwelling unit on the same premises, 
b.  Any corrals, exercise yards or rings shall maintain a distance of not less than 45 feet from any building containing a dwelling unit on the same premises,

CHAPTER 18.35 - REDEMPTION AND RECYCLING FACILITIES 
 
18.35.000 - Purpose. 
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to make the redemption and recycling of reusable materials convenient to the consumer in order to reduce litter and increase the recycling of reusable materials by providing for the permitting and regulating of recycling activities within the city. 
(Ord. 500B §1(part), 1987)  
18.35.010 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter: 
(1)  "Administrative permit" means a permit issued by the director of community development pursuant to the requirements of Section 18.35.020 of this chapter. 
(2)  "Collection facility" means a center for the acceptance by donation, redemption, or purpose of recyclable materials from the public. Such facility does not use power-driven processing equipment except as indicated in Section 18.35.040. Collection facilities may include the following: 
a.  Reverse vending machine(s); 
b.  Small collection facilities which occupy an area of not more than 500 square feet and may include: 
1.  A mobile unit; 
2.  Bulk reverse vending machines or a grouping of reverse vending machines occupying more than 50 square feet; 
3.  Kiosk-type units which may include permanent structures; and 
4.  Unattended containers placed for the donation of recyclable materials. 
(3)  "Mobile recycling unit" means an automobile, truck, trailer, or van licensed by the department of motor vehicles which is used for the collection of recyclable materials. A mobile recycling unit also means the bins, boxes, or containers transported by trucks, vans, or trailers and used for the collection of recyclable materials. 
(4)  "Recycling facility" means a center for the collection and/or processing of recyclable materials. A certified recycling facility or certified processor means a recycling facility certified by the California Department of Conservation as meeting the requirements of the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act of 1986. A recycling facility does not include storage containers or processing activity located on the premises of a residential, commercial, or manufacturing use and used solely for the recycling of material generated by that residential property, business, or manufacturer. Recycling facilities include those facilities as set forth in the definition of "collection facilities" above. 
(5)  "Recyclable material" means reusable material including but not limited to metals, glass, plastic, and paper which are intended for the reuse, remanufacture, or reconstitution for the purpose of using the altered form. Recyclable material does not include refuse or hazardous materials. 
(6)  "Reverse vending machine(s)" is an automated mechanical device which accepts at least one or more types of empty beverage containers including but not limited to aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles and issues a cash refund or a redeemable credit slip with a value of not less than the container's redemption value as determined by the state. A reverse vending machine may sort and process containers mechanically provided that the entire process is enclosed within the machine. In order to accept and temporarily store all three container types in a proportion commensurate with their relative redemption rate and to meet the requirements of certification as a recycling facility, multiple grouping of reverse vending machines may be necessary. A bulk reverse vending machine is a reverse vending machine that is larger than 50 square feet, is designed to accept more than one container at a time, and will pay by weight instead of by container.

CHAPTER 18.41 - WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES  
Article I. - General 
 
18.41.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide uniform standards for the design, placement and permitting of wireless telecommunication facilities consistent with applicable federal requirements. The standards are intended to minimize the adverse visual impacts and operational effects of these facilities through appropriate design, siting and screening techniques while providing for the communication needs of residents, local businesses and governmental agencies. 
(Ord. 690B §2 (part), 2000)  
18.41.020 - Authority. 
Wireless telecommunication facilities are regulated at the federal, state and local level. In February 1996, the Federal Government enacted the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This Act contains provisions concerning the placement of antenna structures and other facilities for use in providing personal wireless services. Specifically, Section 704 preserves the right of local agencies to regulate these facilities based on aesthetics, visual impacts and land use impacts. 
(Ord. 690B §2 (part), 2000)  
18.41.030 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended: 
(1)  "Antenna" means any system of wires, poles, rods, discs or other similar devices used for the transmission or reception of radio frequency electromagnetic waves when such system is external or attached to the exterior of a structure. 
(2)  "Co-location" means the practice of sharing support structures and buildings by wireless telecommunications providers (either public or private). 
(3)  "Façade mounted antenna" means an antenna that is directly attached to or affixed to any building façade. 
(4)  "Flush mounted antenna" means an antenna mounted to a structure which does not project above the facade to which it is mounted, does not project more than 18 inches from the surface it is mounted to, and is a minimum of 15 feet above grade. 
(5)  "Ground mounted antenna" means an antenna with its support structure placed directly on the ground. 
(6)  "Lattice tower" means a three or more legged open structure designed and erected to support wireless telecommunication antennas and connecting appurtenances. 
(7)  "Monopole" means a single pole structure (non-lattice) designed and erected to support wireless telecommunications antennas and connecting appurtenances. 
(8)  "Panel antenna" means an antenna or array or antennas designed to concentrate a signal in a particular area. Panel antennas are typically flat, rectangular devices generally less than six square feet in size, although some types are larger. Also known as directional antennas. 
(9)  "Roof mounted" means an antenna directly attached to the roof of an existing building, water tank, tower or structure other than a telecommunications tower. 
(10)  "Stealthing" means improvements or treatments added to wireless telecommunications facility which mask or blend the proposed facility in to the existing structure or visual backdrop in a such a manner as to render it "minimally visible" to the casual observer. Stealthing may utilize, but does not require, concealment of all components of the wireless facility. 
(11)  "Wireless telecommunication facility" means any structure, antenna, pole, equipment and related improvements which support the wireless telecommunications industry in the transmission and/ or reception of electromagnetic signals.

CHAPTER 18.45 - RIDESHARING PROGRAM AND TRANSPORTATION PLANS  
Article I. - General Provisions 
 
18.45.010 - Ridesharing program established. 
The Lincoln ridesharing program is established. 
(Ord. 418B §1(part), 1982: Ord. 357B §11.01.000, 1979)  
18.45.020 - Purpose. 
The purpose and intent of the ridesharing program is to: 
(1)  Reduce total vehicle emissions in the South Placer region by reducing the number of vehicular trips that might otherwise be generated by home-to-work commuting; 
(2)  Reduce peak-hour traffic circulation in the South Placer region by reducing both the number of vehicular trips and the vehicular miles of travel that might otherwise be generated by home-to-work commuting. 
(Ord. 418B §1(part), 1982: Ord. 357B §11.01.010, 1979)  
18.45.030 - Objective of reducing commuter trips. 
The fundamental objective of the ridesharing program as established by this chapter is to reduce the average number of vehicular trips for home-to-work commuting to 25 percent fewer trips than would occur if all such trips were made in single-occupant motor vehicles. Large employment facilities will be expected to accomplish a higher percentage of this reduction than small employment centers in recognition of the greater opportunity for rideshare matches at large employment facilities.

(Ord. 357B §5.01.030, 1979)  
CHAPTER 18.47 - REQUESTS FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
 
18.47.010 - Purpose. 
This section provides a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking access under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies, procedures, and project entitlement exhibits or conditions of approval. 
(Ord. No. 879B, § 1, 3-26-2013)  
18.47.020 - Applicability. 
A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any property owner, duly authorized tenant or lessee who desires to implement improvements to a specific property that are designed to provide access to housing when the application of a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy, practice, project entitlement exhibit or condition of approval acts as a barrier to reasonable access. This section is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts. 
A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards, practices, and project entitlement exhibits or conditions of approval for the siting, development and use of structures and facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability with equal opportunity to access housing. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made in the manner prescribed by Section 18.47.030. 
(Ord. No. 879B, § 1, 3-26-2013)

All requests shall include the following information: 
(1)  The applicant's name, address and telephone number. 
(2)  The name, address, and telephone number of the property owner(s). 
(3)  The street address and assessor's parcel number of the property for which the request is being made. 
(4)  The current actual use of the property. 
(5)  A statement describing the basis for the claim that the applicant is entitled to and is being denied reasonable accommodation, including a description of the zoning law, provision, regulation, policy, project entitlement exhibit feature or condition of approval from which reasonable accommodation is being requested, a description of the specific accommodation requested, and an explanation of why the requested accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the applicant. 
(6)  Photos, site plans, drawings, and/or other graphics as may be needed to make the proposed changes clear. 
(7)  Concurrent review. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval, then the applicant may file the request concurrently with the application for discretionary approval. 
(Ord. No. 879B, § 1, 3-26-2013)  
18.47.040 - Review authority and procedure. 
(a)  Development Services Director or His/Her Designee. If no approval is sought other than a request for reasonable accommodation, then the request for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the Development Services Director, or his/her designee. The development services director or his/her designee shall make a written determination within five working days and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with Section 18.47.050. 
(b)  Other Review Authority. Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the authority reviewing the discretionary land use application. The applicable reviewing authority shall make a written determination and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with Section 18.47.050. 
(Ord. No. 879B, § 1, 3-26-2013)  
18.47.050 - Findings and decision. 
(a)  Findings. The written decision to grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on consideration of the following: 
(1)  Whether the property which is the subject of the request will be used by an individual or a group of individuals considered disabled under the Acts, and that the accommodation requested is necessary to make the specific property accessible to an individual with disabilities protected under the Acts; 
(2)  Whether there are alternative reasonable accommodations available that would provide an equivalent level of benefit, or if alternative accommodations would be suitable based on the circumstances of this particular case; 
(3)  Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; 
(4)  Whether the requested accommodation would be consistent with the general plan land use designation of the property which is the subject of the reasonable accommodation request, and with the general purpose and intent in the applicable zoning district; 
(5)  Whether the requested accommodation would present a substantial negative impact on the physical attributes of the property. 
(b)  Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation will comply with the findings required in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 879B, § 1, 3-26-2013)  
18.47.060 - Appeal of determination. 
A determination by the reviewing authority to grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 18.94 of this code.

CHAPTER 18.56 - CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS 
 
18.56.010 - TypesConsideration by planning commission. 
Conditional use permits, revocable, conditional or valid for a term, may be issued for any of the uses or purposes for which such permits are required or permitted by the terms of this title. Because of their unusual characteristics, conditional uses require special consideration so that they may be located and developed properly with respect to their effect on the surrounding property. The consideration of a conditional use permit application shall result in the issuance of written findings in support of the planning commission decision, which shall be based on substantial evidence in view of the whole record. To grant a conditional use permit, the planning commission shall find that the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use, building or structure applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city. 
(Ord. 807B § 8, 2006: Ord. 357B § 6.02.000, 1979)  
18.56.020 - Findings required. 
The city council is aware that from time to time persons in possession of property desire to use property for purposes which are not specifically provided for in this title. In order to carry out the intent of this title and to promote the general welfare of the community, the city council authorizes the planning commission to grant conditional use permits for uses which are not provided for in the district, subject to the following: 
(1)  A finding by the planning commission that the use is substantially similar in characteristic to a use or uses currently within the district; 
(2)  A finding by the planning commission that the use would be appropriate in the district applicable to the property as a permitted or conditional use; 
(3)  A finding by the planning commission that the proposed use, with the appropriate conditions, will not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace and morals, comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city; 
(4)  A finding that at least one of the findings in Section 15.32.250 of the municipal code is satisfied. 
(Ord. 357B § 6.02.010, 1979; Ord. No. 913B , § 5(Exh. C), 6-28-2016)  
CHAPTER 18.58 - VARIANCES

(Ord. 458B §7(part), 1984: Ord. 357B §6.03.000(1, 2), 1979)  
18.58.020 - Findings required to grant variance. 
The planning commission, or in the case of applications for variances pursuant to Section 18.58.050 the city planner, may grant a variance when it is determined that: 
(1)  The applicant has shown that because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location, buildings, or surroundings, the strict application of the requirements of this title are found to deprive the subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under the same classification. 
(2)  The grant of the variance would not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and the district in which the subject property is situated. 
(Ord. 458B §7(part), 1984: Ord. 357B §6.03.000(3), 1979)  
18.58.030 - Variance for otherwise unauthorized use or activity prohibited. 
The planning commission and the city planner shall not grant a variance which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zoning regulation governing the parcel of property for which the variance is requested. 
(Ord. 458B §7(part), 1984: Ord. 357B §6.03.000(4), 1979)  
18.58.040 - Written findings required. 
Whenever the planning commission or the city planner grants or denies a variance, the planning commission or the city planner, as the case may be, shall set forth in writing the findings on which the decision is based. 
(Ord. 458B §7(part), 1984)  
18.58.050 - Authority to act on variances. 
The city planner shall have authority to grant a variance from height and yard requirements up to 35 percent of the requirement set forth in the title, upon determining that the criteria set forth in Section 18.58.020 have been met and making the findings required by Section 18.58.020. The city planner may, in his or her discretion, schedule for hearing by the planning commission any application for a variance under his or her authority. The planning commission shall have the authority to grant all applications for variances. 
(Ord. 458B §7(part), 1984)  
18.58.060 - Appeal of action by city planner. 
Any applicant or other person aggrieved by a decision made by the city planner under Section 18.58.050 may appeal to the planning commission under Chapter 18.94.

(Ord. 807B §4, 2006; Ord. 797B §§4, 5, 2005; Ord. No. 935B , § 1, 1-10-2017)  
18.60.020 - Hearing required. 
(a)  Proceeding regarding a PCN determination for the issuance of a license from the ABC shall be scheduled for public hearing before the planning commission within 60 days of receipt of a completed application or as soon thereafter as the matter can be scheduled.

(b)  The hearing shall be held without regard to the technical rules of evidence and all persons desiring to appear shall be permitted to do so. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof that public convenience or necessity would be served by the issuance of the license. Therefore, the applicant shall provide all evidence necessary to show that the selling of alcoholic beverages at the applicant premises will serve public convenience or necessity and will be accomplished in a manner to eliminate any objections received pursuant to this section. In all cases in which an applicant applies for a PCN determination, the planning commission may exercise its discretion to issue or deny issuance of a letter of public convenience or necessity. In exercising its discretion, the planning commission shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The type of proposed use by the applicant; 
(2)  Whether the proposed use will be detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the community; 
(3)  Whether the use would enhance the economic viability of the area in which it is proposed to be located; 
(4)  The extent of support or opposition to the proposed license from members of the community; 
(5)  The number of licenses within a one-mile radius of the proposed licensed location; 
(6)  The type of licensed premises within a one-mile radius of the proposed licensed location and the extent to which the proposed license would cause a further over-concentration of the particular type of premises in the area; 
(7)  The background and the history of the applicant, including the nature and extent of problems on any premises where he or she has operated a licensed premises in the past; 
(8)  Whether the applicant has ever been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude or any offense related to the sale or use of alcoholic beverages; 
(9)  How close the proposed establishment will be to a residential neighborhood, place of worship, or school; 
(10)  Whether there is a history of police or crime-related problems in the area proposed for a license; and 
(11)  Whether the proposed license would enhance recreational or entertainment opportunities in the area. 
(c)  The planning commission may determine that the public convenience or necessity will be met and the health, safety or welfare of the community will be prompted only if certain conditions are imposed upon any license issued by the ABC. Such conditions shall be included in the planning commission's decision and shall be communicated to the ABC. The conditions may cover any matter relating to the privileges to be exercised under the license. If a letter is issued with conditions applied, it shall specifically set forth that the public convenience or necessity is served only if the conditions set forth in the letter are met by the applicant. Examples of such conditions can be, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Sales of beer and malt beverages shall be in quantities of not less than a six pack; 
(2)  Sales of wine shall be in containers of at least 750 ml; 
(3)  Wine coolers shall not be sold in quantities of less than factory packs of four;

(d)  If necessary, the hearing may be continued for further review. At the conclusion of the hearing, the planning commission shall determine whether the public convenience or necessity will be served by authorizing the issuance of a license for the applicant premises. The PCN determination shall be reduced to writing by the community development director who will author a PCN determination stating whether the planning commission finds public convenience and necessity will or will not be served by the issuance of a license from the ABC. The written determination shall be served by mail upon the applicant and the ABC within 15 business days of the decision of the planning commission. 
(e)  No letter of public convenience or necessity shall be issued by the planning commission pursuant to this section unless the applicant agrees, in writing, that if the ABC issues a license to sell alcoholic beverages, the license will be subject to all conditions imposed as part of the PCN determination at all times the license is in use and in effect. 
(Ord. 797B §4 (part), 2005)  
18.60.030 - ExpirationNo transfer of determination. 
(a)  A PCN determination in support of the issuance of a license for the ABC is only valid for one year from the date of the planning commission's action and the PCN determination shall so state. If no license to sell alcoholic beverages has been issued to the applicant for the applicant premises, within one year of issuance of a favorable PCN determination, the city's PCN determination shall be deemed withdrawn without the need for further action by the planning commission or the applicant, and the applicant must reapply if he/she seeks another PCN determination. 
(b)  Except as provided in Business and Professions Code section 23958.4, the PCN determination is not transferable to any other applicant or proposed licensee. Unless permitted by Business and Professions Code section 23958.4, any proposed licensee for the same premises must submit a new application and follow the procedures for the issuance of a PCN determination in this section. Nothing in this section precludes the city from protesting the issuance of a license from the ABC pursuant to other sections of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, including, but not limited to, section 23958. 
(Ord. 797B §4 (part), 2005)

CHAPTER 18.61 - CHILD DAY CARE USES 
 
18.61.010 - Purpose. 
Consistent with the findings of the state, the city council finds that child day care services are an essential service for working parents in the city of Lincoln and that child care services in family homes are desirable to parents and provide children with a residential environment that is conducive to healthy and safe development. Regulations in this chapter are intended to address child day care uses in both residential and nonresidential zoning districts consistent with the provisions of state law and in a manner that recognizes the need for such services and the importance of minimizing the effects on surrounding properties. 
(Ord. 745B §2(part), 2003)

(1)  Small Family Day Care Homes. In accordance with state law, small family day care homes operated under the standards of state law constitute an accessory use of residentially zoned and occupied properties and do not fundamentally alter the nature of the underlying residential use.

Certain exceptions, in the form of legitimate physical barriers and buffers, such as a streambed corridor, highway, or arterial that would provide comparable separation may be allowable as determined by the director of community development; 
d.  Traffic Control. To ensure that children are not placed at risk and that street traffic is not unduly interrupted, each large family day care home shall provide the equivalent of two loading/unloading parking spaces for child drop-off and pick-up. Loading spaces may be located in the driveway of the home or on the street directly abutting the subject property where on-street parking is permitted; 
e.  Parking. In addition to the standard single-family parking requirement of two covered parking spaces located outside the required front yard and street-side yard setback areas, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided for each employee that does not reside at the home. The driveway may serve to meet the employee parking requirement; 
f.  Noise. In order to protect adjacent residential dwellings from noise impacts, outdoor activities are restricted to the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Amplification equipment shall not be used for outdoor activities associated with the day care use. The day care use is subject to compliance with the city's noise ordinance;

The site plan shall clearly identify pedestrian routes to and from the drop-off and pick-up areas, including sidewalks and directional signage; 
c.  Parking. Required parking shall include one space for each employee, one visitor space for every ten students, plus adequate drop-off/pick-up areas as determined by the community development director. Parking shall be provided based on the maximum student and corresponding employee capacity for the facility; 
d.  Noise. In order to protect adjacent uses from noise impacts associated with the child day care facility, hours of operation are limited to 14 hours a day between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., and outdoor activities are restricted to the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Amplification equipment shall not be used for outdoor activities associated with the day care use.

(3)  Foster attainment of those sections of the city's general plan which specifically relate to preservation and enhancement of the particular character of the city, including, but not limited to, that described in the Lincoln downtown urban design plan, through encouraging private interests to assist in their implementation;

CHAPTER 18.68 - ADMINISTRATIVE DESIGN REVIEW 
 
18.68.010 - Administrative design reviewsingle-family residences. 
The city council finds that there exists in the city, conditions with promote disharmony and reduce land and property values. The council also finds that the lack of appropriate guidelines for the design of new single-family structures and property contributes to these conditions. It further finds desirable the provision of such guidelines for the protection and enhancement of land and property values, for the creation and preservation of a high-quality environment and for the promotion of the health, safety and general welfare of the community. Based upon the above findings, the city council hereby establishes an administrative design review process for all newly constructed dwellings (including all modular/prefabricated dwellings) placed upon a single family lot subdivided pursuant to a final or parcel map approved by the city council prior to July 1, 1979, which pursuant to Section 18.64.010 is not subject to design review as provided in Division VII of Title 18 of this code. 
(Ord. 678B §2 (part), 1999)  
18.68.020 - Authority to act on administrative design review. 
The community development director or his/her designee shall have authority to approve an administrative design review application upon a determination that the criteria set forth in Section 18.68.030 have been met. Within ten days of receiving a complete application, the community development director will render a determination regarding the approval of the application. The director shall have the authority to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application. The community development director may, at his or her discretion, schedule for review by the planning commission any application for approval. The planning commission shall have the authority to approve, approve with conditions or deny all applications for design review if so scheduled by director. 
(Ord. 678B §2 (part), 1999)  
18.68.030 - Criteria for approval. 
Single-family dwellings are required to meet the following criteria in order to be approved for administrative design review: 
(1)  The structure is covered with an exterior material customarily used in new residential structures in the surrounding neighborhood. This includes garages as well as the main structure. 
(2)  The exterior covering material extends to the ground. If a solid concrete or masonry perimeter foundation is used, the foundation shall be textured or colored to match the exterior covering material. Alternate skirting materials customarily used in residential structures in the surrounding neighborhood will be considered compatible. 
(3)  The roofing material is of a material customarily used on residential structures in the surrounding neighborhood. 
(4)  The roof pitch design is one customary to the pitch on residential structures in the surrounding neighborhood. 
(5)  The evaluations including the placement of doors, windows, eaves and gable overhangs are typical for those customarily used in residential structures in the surrounding neighborhood. 
(6)  The dwelling meets all of the requirements for the zoning district, including setbacks, lot coverage, off-street parking requirements and other development standards applicable to the district in which it is to be located. 
(7)  The façade that fronts on the street is designed with sufficient detail to make it visually compatible with residential structures in the area. 
(Ord. 678B §2 (part), 1999)

(Ord. 678B §2 (part), 1999)  
CHAPTER 18.69 - OAK TREE PRESERVATION 
 
18.69.000 - Purpose. 
The city council finds and determines that the oak trees within the city are beneficial to the health and welfare of the citizens of Lincoln in that they preserve and promote natural beauty, reduce soil erosion, enhance property values, improve air quality, help maintain climatic balance, decrease wind velocities, abate noise, aid in water absorption, and help reduce energy consumption for air cooling by providing shade, and that preservation of these oak trees is in the public interest. 
It shall be the policy of the city to preserve all oak trees possible through its development review process while at the same time recognizing individual rights to develop private property. 
(Ord. 459B §1, 1984)  
18.69.010 - Guidelines. 
The city council may adopt guidelines to regulate the preservation of oak trees located within the city limits. After adoption of the guidelines, the planning commission, the city council and/or the design review committee, as the case may be, shall utilize these guidelines in reviewing applications for projects including but not limited to rezonings, subdivision maps, parcel maps, development permits, conditional use permits, design review board approvals, and variances and shall impose conditions of approval on such projects consistent with said guidelines. 
(Ord. 459B §2, 1984)  
18.69.020 - Enforcement. 
Inspection for compliance with the conditions of project approval relating to the preservation of oak trees shall be part of the city's regular project inspections. Whenever the city building official or city planner determines that construction activities are not in compliance with the conditions of project approval, the building official shall issue a stop work order which shall prohibit any further development activity until the violation(s) have been corrected. The stop work order shall set forth in writing the violation(s) and shall list the remedies to be taken to correct the violation(s). 
(Ord. 459B §3, 1984)  
18.69.030 - Restoration and replacement of trees. 
If it is determined pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 18.54.080 that an oak tree(s) has been removed or irrevocably harmed so that its death is imminent in violation of the conditions of project approval, the city may require one or more of the following to correct the violation: 
(1)  Replacement of the oak tree(s) removed or irrevocably harmed in violation of the conditions of project approval by planting replacement specimen trees of no less than 15 gallons in size, having a total combined diameter at the time of planting equal to the diameter of the removed tree(s). 
(2)  If the project site is not capable of supporting all the required replacement trees, a fee shall be paid to the city equal to the retail cost, at the time of the violation, of the replacement trees required in subsection (1) of this section, but which cannot be accommodated on the project site. Such fees shall be deposited in a separate fund and used to plant new trees in the city, to maintain existing trees owned by the city and to maintain trees located within the city's right-of-way. 
(3)  In addition to the remedies set forth in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the city shall have recourse to any penalty which may be imposed under this title for failure to comply with conditions of project approval.

CHAPTER 18.91 - TRAFFIC IMPACT MITIGATION FEES

Adequate streets, traffic and transit improvements and facilities contribute to and improve the quality of life within the city and are essential to the public health, safety and welfare.

The amount of the traffic impact mitigation fee shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of city streets, traffic and transit improvements and facilities by the future inhabitants and/or users of new development for which the zoning change, conditional use permit, or tentative map is granted. 
(Ord. 447B §1(part), 1983)

CHAPTER 18.99 - PUBLIC FACILITIES FEE 
 
18.99.010 - Purpose. 
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the Lincoln public facilities plan and to mitigate the anticipated growth caused by new development in the Lincoln area, certain public facilities such as roads and community facilities must be constructed. The city council has determined that a public facilities fee is needed in order to finance these public improvements and to pay for the development's fair share of the construction costs of these improvements. In establishing the fee described in the following sections, the city council finds the fee to be consistent with its general plan and, pursuant to Government Code section 65913.2, has considered the effects of the fee with respect to the city's housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan. 
(Ord. 517B §1(part), 1989)  
18.99.020 - Lincoln public facilities fee. 
A public facilities fee is established on issuance of all building permits for new development to pay for community facilities and roads. The city council shall in council resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fee, describe the benefit and impact area on which the development fee is imposed, list the specific public improvements to be financed, describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types of new developments and set forth time for payment. As described in the fee resolution, this development fee shall be paid by each developer prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the commercial or industrial project or the respective dwelling units in a residential project. On an annual basis, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of developments and whether the described public facilities are still needed. 
(Ord. 517B §1(part), 1989)  
18.99.030 - Limited use of fees. 
The revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate and special account and such revenues, along with any interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to: 
(1)  Pay for the city's future construction of facilities described in the resolution enacted pursuant to Section 18.99.020, or to reimburse the city for those described or listed facilities constructed by the city with funds advanced by the city from other sources, or 
(2)  Reimburse developers who have entered into reimbursement agreements pursuant to Section 18.99.040. 
(Ord. 517B §1(part), 1989)  
18.99.040 - Developer construction of facilities. 
Whenever a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a development permit, to construct a public facility described in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 18.99.020, which facility is determined by the city to have the impacts of that development, and when such construction is necessary to ensure efficient and timely construction of the facilities network, a reimbursement agreement with the developer and a credit against the fee which would otherwise be charged pursuant to this chapter on the development project, shall be offered. The reimbursement amount shall not include the cost for that portion of the improvement needed to mitigate the burdens created by the development. 
(Ord. 517B §1(part), 1989)  
18.99.050 - Fee adjustment. 
A developer of any project subject to the fee described in Section 18.99.020 may apply to the city council for a reduction, adjustment, or a waiver of that fee, based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of the development and either the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk not later than (1) 60 days prior to the public hearing on the development permit application for the project, or (2) if no development permit is required, at the time of the filing of the request for a building permit. The application shall state in detail the factual basis for the claim of waiver, reduction, or adjustment. The city council shall consider the application at the public hearing on the permit application or at a separate hearing held within 60 days after the filing of the fee adjustment application, whichever is later. The city council shall approve the application in whole or in part only upon finding that due to specific and specified factors particular to the proposed development, the charge of the fee or the type of facility is not applicable to or of benefit to the development. The decision of the city council shall be final. If a reduction, adjustment, or waiver is granted, any change in use within the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment, or reduction of the fee.
