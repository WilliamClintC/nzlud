Federal Insurance Administration. (Ord. 0-77-60, 9-19-77)
(b) The Village shall maintain the records of lowest floor elevations, flood proofing certifications, all
variance documents required by section 60.6a(5) and (6) of the rules and regulations of the National
Flood Insurance Program, permit applications and all other records required by the Federal
Insurance Administration.
Sec. 6-49A. Variations.
Upon application by the petitioner, review and recommendation by the Community Development Group,
the corporate authorities may grant variations from the strict provisions of this Article subject to

comply with the intent of this Article. (Ord. 0-88-43, 7-18-88)
Sec. 6-50A. Disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on occasion or the
flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Article does not imply that
development either inside or outside areas designated as an A Zone will be free from flooding or
damage. This Article does not create liability on the part of the Village or any officer or employee thereof
for any flood damage that results from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 0-77-60, 9-19-77)
Sec. 6-51A. Filling.
The filling of lands where the existing ground elevation is less than the flood base elevation shall be
permitted provided:
(a) That the material is obtained from adjacent areas lying below the flood base elevation or
(b) That the fill material obtained elsewhere is offset by the removal of an equivalent volume of material
obtained in the immediate vicinity of the building site from elevations lower than the flood base
elevation. If fill or any type of construction which would displace flood waters is placed within the
flood plain, a flood reservoir shall be constructed (the bottom of which shall not be lower than the
bottom of the adjacent water course) equal in volume to the volume of such fill or construction
deposited below the flood base elevation. Each such flood reservoir shall have adequate provision
for drainage to the waterway. The deepening of a water course is permitted, but the material
removed must not be deposited below the flood base elevation, except in accordance with (b) above.
The placement of fill material shall parallel the water course. (M.C. 1963, § 22.901; Ord. No. 0-64-29)
Sec. 6-52A. Foundations - Waterproofing.

materials to the exterior of the wall, and beneath the wall and floor slab, with appropriate water stops at
all other joints as shown in Koppers Bulletin AIA No. 12b, p23-p26 or the equivalent. If hydrostatic
pressure is prevented by an adequate drainage system, such as outlined in Section 6-44, the walls need
only be damp-proofed, as shown in Koppers Bulletin AIA No. 12B, p26 and 27 or the equivalent, and
joints sealed with pitch without the need for an impervious membrane. (M.C. § 22.903(b); Ord. No. 0-64-
29)
Sec. 6-53A. Foundations - Floor construction.
6/5/2019 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/IL/Deerfield/index.htm 130/495
All floors at grade or below grade subject to hydrostatic pressure shall be designed to resist a uniformly
distributed uplift equal to the full hydrostatic pressure, unless a system of exterior footing drains and
under floor drains are installed to prevent the development of such hydrostatic pressure in the event that
the soils at the site of the building are highly impervious and the only water seepage anticipated is
penetration downward from ground surface rather than upward from below, the exterior footing drain
system would be considered adequate without the requirement of an under floor drainage system with
the approval of the Director of Building and Zoning. (M.C. 1963, § 22.903(c); Ord. No. 0-64-29;
renumbered Ord. 0-77-60, 9-19-77)
Sec. 6-54A. Foundations - Grading around building.
Wherever building sites are or may be subject to flooding, the lot shall be sloped one foot (1') to fifteen
feet (15') around each building and shall be filled up to about six inches (6") or one foot (1') below the
minimum sill elevation for building openings and maintained at an elevation one foot (1') above the flood

mortgage or trust deed may contain such covenants and agreements to safeguard properly the
bonds as may be provided for in the ordinance authorizing such bonds and shall be executed in such
manner as may be provided for in such ordinance. The provisions of this Article and any such
ordinance and any such mortgage or trust deed shall constitute a contract with the holder or holders
of the bonds which will continue in effect until the principal of, the interest on, and the redemption
premiums, if any, on the bonds so issued have been fully paid. The Village may, in any such

The validity of the bonds is not dependent upon nor affected by the validity or regularity of the
proceedings relating to the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, improvement, equipping,
betterment or extension of the development project for which the bonds are issued. The ordinance
authorizing the bonds may provide that the bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to
this Article, which recital is conclusive evidence of their validity and the regularity of their issuance.

Village to pay the bonds, the interest or premium thereon, if any. The bonds shall not constitute an
indebtedness of the Village or a loan of credit thereof within the meaning of any constitutional or

provisions of this Article and that it does not constitute an indebtedness of the Village or a loan of credit
thereof within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provisions. (Ord. 0-81-26, 4-6-81)
Sec. 9-36. Powers conferred as additional and supplemental.
The powers conferred by this Article are in addition and supplemental to, and the limitations imposed by
this Article shall not affect the powers the Village may have by any law or any other article or chapter.
Development projects may be acquired, purchased, constructed, reconstructed, improved, bettered,
equipped, extended and financed and bonds may be issued under this Article for such purposes,
notwithstanding that any other law or ordinance may likewise provide for the acquisition, purchase,

service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate
retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications. Carrier access
charges, right of access charges, charges for use of intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications

retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be
required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department.

shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized
by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the
department may reasonably require.
(b)Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and
shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained
through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free
when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's
having discontinued the making of resales.
(c)Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the ground of being a sale for resale
unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the

of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-2010)

this article had not been adopted. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-2010)

Article 6. Smoke Free Air Regulations
Sec. 12-32. Background:
Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the environment of such smoke
as well as the potential of damage to property that may result from the incendiary nature of such activity.
It has been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and
nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered hazardous to
health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrous oxide and formaldehyde. Secondhand
smoke (68 percent of the total smoke produced by a cigarette) affects the health of the bystander,
interfering with respiratory tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative
reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer.
Because the hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect, material and direct, on the public
health, safety, welfare, comfort, and property of residents of the village, it is necessary and desirable to
establish regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places, in all enclosed places of
employment, near entrances to all such public places and places of employment, in and near open air
public dining areas, and within certain unenclosed public places including school grounds, parks and
recreation areas and outdoor venues. (Ord. 0-05-51, 12-19-2005, eff. 1-1-2006)
Sec. 12-33. Purpose:

public dining areas and within twenty five feet (25') of such areas, and within certain unenclosed public
places including school grounds, parks and recreation areas and outdoor venues in order to ensure that
nonsmokers may breathe air free from the hazardous effects of secondhand smoke. (Ord. 0-05-51, 12-

Sec. 13-1. Property Maintenance Code:
The 2012 edition of the international property maintenance code, as published by the International Code
Council, Inc., is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated as if fully set forth herein, with the
following modifications:
Section 13.2, Minimum Requirements, is amended to read as follows:
(a) Every residential rental dwelling shall be provided with heating facilities capable of maintaining a
temperature of sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius) at a level of three feet (3 ft., 914
mm.) above the floor and a distance of three feet (3 ft., 914 mm.) from the exterior wall in all
habitable rooms, bathrooms and toilet rooms.
(b) Every owner and operator of any building who rents, leases or lets one or more dwelling units,
rooming units, dormitory or guest rooms on terms, either expressed or implied, to furnish heat to the
occupants, shall supply sufficient heat during the period from September 1 to May 1 to maintain a
room temperature of not less than sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius) in all habitable

Celsius) during other hours. This temperature shall be measured at a point three feet (3 ft., 914 mm.)

provisions of this code or such sections do not fully apply, or the requirements of this code or such

Sec. 16-29. Stormwater Runoff And Unpolluted Discharges:
No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to
any sanitary sewer. (Ord. 0-13-51, 11-4-2013)
Sec. 16-30. Discharge Of Stormwater:
(a)Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically
designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the director of public works and
engineering. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged on approval of
the director of public works and engineering, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
(b)A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all
commercial and industrial developments of one acre or more in area, for all multiple-family residential
developments of two (2) or more acres in area, and for all single-family developments of five (5)
acres or more in area. Notwithstanding the area limitations stated above, multiple-family residential
developments, commercial developments and industrial developments shall be required to provide
storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff when the development is located within two
hundred feet (200') of an existing storm sewer, or when the development results from a change in
use, a change in zoning classification or the granting of a special use.
(c)The release rate of stormwater from all developments requiring detention shall not exceed the
stormwater runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state. A release rate of not greater
than that calculated from a storm of 3-year frequency with a runoff rate coefficient of fifteen onehundredths
(0.15) will be acceptable unless the applicant can show by detailed calculations which
are acceptable to the village engineer that the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the
area is greater.
(d)Storm sewer systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass through the development the flow from
all upstream areas for a storm of design frequency assuming that the land is in a fully developed
state under present zoning or zoning proposed under the village's comprehensive plan. The bypass
flow rate shall be computed utilizing a runoff coefficient of not less than thirty five one-hundredths
(0.35). An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate provided, will be made for upstream
detention when such upstream detention and release rate has previously been approved by the
village and has been constructed.
(e)The live detention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 100-year frequency
rainfall, as published by the U.S. weather bureau for this area. The detention volume required shall
6/5/2019 Code Book Viewer
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/IL/Deerfield/index.htm 321/495
be that necessary to temporarily store the runoff of 100-year rainfall, for any and all durations, from
the fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir, less that volume discharged during the
same duration at the approved release rate.
(f)In the event the downstream sewers are inadequate to receive the release rate hereinabove provided,
then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the receiving downstream
sewers and additional detention as determined by the village engineer shall be required to store that
portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers.
(g)Plans, specifications and calculations for stormwater detention facilities as required hereunder, shall
be submitted to the village engineer for approval prior to the commencement of construction. (Ord. 0-

repair and the engineering and supervision thereof, together with an additional sum, not to exceed six
percent (6%) of the amount of said cost of construction, engineering and supervision, to be applied
toward the payment of the costs of preparing a special tax list, levying and collecting said special tax as
provided for in this Article, and an additional amount not to exceed six percent (6%) of the cost of
construction, engineering and supervision, to be applied as a reserve for deficiency in interest, shall be
made by the Village Engineer or by such other officer or board as is designated by the ordinance to take
charge of the construction, reconstruction or repair of the sidewalk, or portions thereof, together with a
list of the lots, blocks tracts or parcels of land touching upon the line of the sidewalk or adjacent to the
public right of way whereon such sidewalk or portion thereof is located, and the names of the parties
who last paid the general taxes on the respective lots, blocks, tracts or parcels and the frontage,
superficial area, or assessed value as specified in this Article, according to the provisions of such
ordinance in providing for the levy of the cost by such frontage, superficial area or assessed value.
Thereupon, if the owner of any lot, block, tract or parcel of land has failed or refused to construct,
reconstruct or repair his portion of the sidewalk in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance, the
Village Engineer or other specified officer or board shall proceed to prepare a special tax list against
those lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land in front of, or adjacent to, or touching upon the sidewalk or
the public right of way whereon the sidewalk is located which is the subject of such construction,
reconstruction or repair, ascertaining by computation the amount of special taxes and the annual
installments thereof to be charged against each of such lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land on account
of the construction, reconstruction or repair of the sidewalk, according to the rule fixed for the levy of that
special tax by the ordinance. The aggregate amount of each special tax levied against the lots, blocks,
tracts or parcels of land provided for herein shall be divided into five (5) annual installments of equal
amounts, except that all fractional amounts shall be added to the first installment, so as to leave the
remaining installments equal in amounts and each a multiple of one hundred dollars ($100.00). This
special tax list shall be filed in the office of the Village Engineer or of such other specified officer or
board, which officer or board shall thereupon issue warrants directed to the Village Collector, or to such
officer as may be so designated in the ordinance, for the collection of the amount of special tax so
ascertained and appearing from this special tax list to be due from the respective lots, blocks, tracts or
parcels of land. The first installment shall be due and payable on the second day of January next after
the date of the issuance of the first voucher on account of the work done, and the second installment
shall be due and payable one year thereafter, and so on annually until all installments are paid. The
specified officer or board shall prepare, execute and file in the office of the Village Collector or such
other officer that may be designated to collect the tax, a certificate of the date of issuance of the first
voucher and of the amount thereof, which certificate shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the first

officer designated to collect the tax on or before the first day of August in each year, shall make a written
report of this special tax for the purpose of applying for judgment against and the selling of lands for
such taxes due the Village. This report shall also contain an enumeration of (1) all the lots, blocks, tracts
or parcels of land upon which this special tax remains unpaid, (2) the names of the respective owners
thereof, so far as the names are known to the collecting officer, (3) the amount due and unpaid upon
each lot, block, tract or parcel; and (4) a copy of the ordinance ordering the construction, reconstruction
of repair of the sidewalk. This report shall be accompanied by the oath of the officer that the list is a
correct return of the lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land on which the special tax levied by authority of
the Village for the cost or partial cost, as the case may be, of the sidewalk specified in that ordinance
remains due and unpaid, and that the amounts therein stated as due and unpaid, have not been
collected, nor any part thereof. This report, when so made, is prima facie evidence that all the forms and
requirements of the law in relation to making that return have been complied with, and that the special
tax, as mentioned in the report is due and unpaid.
Sec. 19-50. Judgment and Sale.
When the Village Collector completes such a report, he shall at once proceed to obtain judgment against
the lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land enumerated therein for the special tax remaining due and
unpaid, in the same manner as may be provided by law for obtaining judgment against land for taxes
due and unpaid to the county and State, and in the same manner shall proceed to sell the same for the
special tax due and unpaid. In obtaining this judgment, and making this sale, the said officer shall be
governed by the general revenue laws of the State of Illinois, except when otherwise provided in this
Article. The general revenue laws shall also apply to the execution of certificates of sales and deeds,
and to the force and effect of these sales and deeds. All other laws in relation to the enforcement and
collection of taxes, and redemption from tax sales, shall apply to proceedings to collect this special tax,
except as otherwise provided in this Article.
Sec. 19-51. Construction by Owner; Order for Reimbursement.
Whenever payment of the cost of such sidewalk is required to be made in part by special tax and in part
out of any general fund or other revenues of the Village, and the owner of a lot, block, tract or parcel of
land constructs, reconstructs or repairs the sidewalk in accordance with the ordinance for its
construction, reconstruction or repair, the officer or board directed by the ordinance to superintend the
construction or repair thereof shall thereupon have issued to that owner, an order on the Village
Treasurer for the owner's cost of the construction, reconstruction or repair of the sidewalk, as a credit
against the amount of special tax chargeable to the lot, block, tract or parcel of land of that owner.
Sec. 19-52. Bids.
Contracts for the construction, reconstruction or repair of sidewalks as provided in this Article, when the
expense thereof exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) shall be let to the lowest
responsible bidder in the following manner: Notice shall be given by the officer or board designated in
the ordinance to take charge of the construction, reconstruction or repair and supervision of a sidewalk
by advertisement at least twice, not more than thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days in advance of the
day of opening the bids, that bids will be received for the construction, reconstruction or repair of that
sidewalk in accordance with the ordinance therefor, in one or more newspapers published within the
Village. The notice shall state the time of opening the bids. All bids offered shall be accompanied by
cash or a check payable to the order of the officer or board having charge of the improvement, and
certified by a responsible bank, for an amount which shall not be less than ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate of the bid. All contracts shall be approved by the officer of the board, having the supervision

expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
(e)Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any
amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to
the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section.
(f)Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security
fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the
village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum
balance required in subsection (c) of this section.
(g)Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on
deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the
village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law.
In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable
costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any
amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
(h)Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition
to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right
the village may have.

delay as possible (e.g., protected trees which threaten to fall or have fallen on houses or power lines
or impede safe passage of streets or have become uprooted or unstable as a result of severe
weather, floods or high winds), then it shall be lawful for the owner to remove such protected tree to
the extent necessary to avoid immediate danger or hazard without a tree removal permit provided
that within fourteen (14) days after taking any such action the owner shall submit an after the fact
tree removal permit application describing the tree emergency and the actions taken.
(b)If the village forester upon his review of the tree removal permit application concurs that a tree
emergency existed and that the owner's actions were warranted in response to the tree emergency,
an after the fact tree removal permit shall be issued without fee and no further action under these

Section 22-19, the officer, prior to an arrest, may request the person to provide a sample of his or her
breath for a preliminary breath screening test using a portable device approved by the Department of
Public Health. The results of this preliminary breath screening test may be used by the law enforcement
officer for the purpose of assisting with the determination of whether to require a chemical test as
authorized under Sections 22-19.1 and 22-19.2 and the appropriate type of test to request. Any
chemical test authorized under Sections 22-19.1 and 22-19.2 may be requested by the officer regardless
of the result of the preliminary breath screening test, if probable cause for an arrest exists. The result of
a preliminary breath screening test may be used by the defendant as evidence in any administrative or
court proceeding involving a violation of Sections 22-19 or 22-19.1. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)
Sec. 22-19.7. Driver involvement in personal injury or fatal motor vehicle
accident;chemical test.
(a) Any person who drives or is in actual control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this
State shall be deemed to have given consent to a breath test using a portable device as approved by
the Department of Public Health or to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath or urine for the
purpose of determining the alcohol or other drug content of such person's blood if there is probable
cause to believe that such person was the driver at fault, in whole or in part, for a motor vehicle
accident which resulted in the death or personal injury of any person. Compliance with this Section
does not relieve such person from the requirements of Section 22-19.1 of this Code.
(b) Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition rendering such person
incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a)
of this Section. In addition, if a driver of a vehicle is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor
vehicle accident, any physician licensed to practice medicine, registered nurse or a phlebotomist
acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing purposes to
ascertain the presence of alcohol or other drugs, upon the specific request of a law enforcement
officer. However, no such testing shall be performed until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on
scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the
patient.
(c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be warned by the law enforcement
officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an
alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more may result in the suspension of such person's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle.
(d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test which discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or
more, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State
on a form prescribed by the Secretary, certifying that the test or tests were requested pursuant to
subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which
disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more.
(e) The results of any test or tests administered pursuant to this Section, other than a test conducted
with a portable device, may be used in a civil or criminal action. Upon the trial of any civil or criminal
action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving
or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of
alcohol in the person's blood or breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's
blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:
(1) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less, it shall presumed that the person
was not under the influence of alcohol.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/IL/Deerfield/index.htm 416/495
(2) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.10, such facts
shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol,
but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person
was under the influence of alcohol.
(3) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, it shall be presumed that the
person was under the influence of alcohol.
(4) The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any
other relevant evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was under the influence of
alcohol.
(f) If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test under the provisions of this Section, evidence of
refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to
have been committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.
(g) For the purposes of this Section, a personal injury shall include any injury that requires immediate
professional attention in either a doctor's office or a medical facility. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)

circuits. The youthful offender ordered to participate in the Program shall bear all costs associated
with participation in the Program. A parent or guardian of the offender may assume the obligation of
the offender to pay the costs of the Program. The court may waive the requirement that the offender
pay the costs of participation in the Program upon a finding of indigence.
(c) As used in this Section, "appropriate victims" means victims whose condition is determined by the
visit supervisor to demonstrate the results of motor vehicle accidents involving persons under the
influence of alcohol without being excessively gruesome or traumatic to the observer.
(d) Any visitation shall include, before any observation of victims or disabled persons, a comprehensive
counseling session with the visitation supervisor at which the supervisor shall explain and discuss the
experiences which may be encountered during the visitation in order to ascertain whether the
visitation is appropriate. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.00 CONTROL OVER USE
2.00-A Establishment of New Uses
The use of a structure or lot established after the effective
date of this Ordinance shall be for a use which is herein
specified as a Permitted, Special Accessory or Temporary use in
the district regulations applicable to the district in which
such structure or lot is located.
2.00-B Existing Building Permits
Where a building permit for a structure has been issued in
accordance with law prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance and where construction has commenced within six (6)
months of such effective date and is completed within two (2)
years of such effective date, the structure may be completed in
accordance with the approved plans, and further, may upon
completion be occupied under a certificate of occupancy for the
use originally designated subject thereafter to the provisions
of Article 10, Nonconformities.
2.00-C Existing Uses
1. Where the use of a structure or lot existing at the time of
the adoption of this Ordinance is rendered nonconforming
under the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of
Article 10, Nonconformities, shall apply to such use,
except as otherwise provided herein.
2. Where a structure and the use thereof or use of a lot
lawfully exists on the effective date of this Ordinance,
and is classified by this Ordinance as a special use in the
district in which it is located, such use shall be
considered a lawful Special Use. A Special Use permit
issued in accordance with procedures herein set forth shall
be required for any expansion or change of such existing
legal structure or Special Use.
3. Multiple Use Unified Development shall be classified as a
special use planned unit development in the C-2 Outlying
Commercial District, and shall be considered a lawful
special use planned unit development, Application for a
Multiple Use Unified Development shall be permitted in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein for special
uses, except that the standards and required findings shall
be the same as the standards and required findings set
forth for a special use planned unit development. Approval
2-2
of a Multiple Use Unified Development for a tract of land
shall not affect the rights of a property owner to develop
the property in conformance with the provisions of the
underlying zoning district; however, an applicant or
property owner who has applied for and obtained the
approval of a Multiple Use Unified Development shall
forfeit its rights to develop the property in conformance
with the provisions of the underlying zoning district and
shall have the obligation to complete the Multiple Use
Unified Development as set forth by the ordinance approving
the application for a Multiple Use Unified Development. An
amendment to a Multiple Use Unified Development shall be
required for any expansion or change of any structures or
uses existing as part of the Multiple Use Unified
Development. An amendment to a Multiple Use Unified
Development shall be permitted in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein for amendments to a special use
planned unit development. (Ord. O-18-05)
2.00-D Existing Unlawful Uses

2-3
2.00-I Single Family Residences Constructed on Illegally Created
Parcels. (Ord. O-94-04)
If prior to the adoption of this amendatory ordinance a singlefamily
residence had been constructed pursuant to a building
permit and thereafter the portion of the lot on which the single
family residence was constructed was separated from the original
lot in contravention of Village Ordinances, the single family
residence shall be considered to be legally constructed and
shall be subject to the provisions regulating expansion and
restoration just as properties qualifying as a lot of record. A
single family residence may receive such treatment only if:
1. The single family residence was constructed pursuant to a
building permit issued on the basis of including the entire
lot to satisfy the minimum bulk requirements of the
governing zoning district;
2. Subsequent to issuance of the building permit, the portion
of the lot on which the single family residence was
constructed was separated from the entire lot in
contravention of the Village ordinances;
3. Both the single family residence parcel and the remaining
portion of the lot are under separate and distinct
ownership.
In no event shall a building permit be issued for the
undeveloped portion of the lot which resulted from the
separation of the single family residence parcel from the entire
lot. If the single family residence parcel does not meet the
zoning district bulk requirements and/or the single family
residence encroaches into any required setback, any expansion,
redevelopment or restoration of the single family residence
shall conform to the provisions of Article 10 hereof.
2.00-J Erroneously Issued Permits (O-94-04)
In the event a single family residence has been constructed and:
1. The building permit applicant believed the property
qualified as a buildable lot; and
2. The Village issued a building permit; and
3. Subsequent to the completion of the single family residence
and the issuance of an occupancy permit it was determined
that the property did not qualify as a buildable lot and
was not entitled to building permit, said single family
residence shall nonetheless be deemed to be legally
2-4
constructed. All zoning district regulations and
provisions governing single family residences shall apply
including, but not limited to, those provisions governing
bulk, setbacks, use, restoration in the event of casualty
loss, redevelopment and expansion; said single family
residence shall nonetheless be deemed to be legally
constructed. All zoning district regulations and
provisions governing single family residences shall apply
including, but not limited to, those provisions governing
bulk, setbacks, use, restoration in the event of casualty
loss, redevelopment and expansion.
2.01 CONTROL OVER BULK

Each new building or structure shall conform with the bulk
regulations established herein for the district in which such
building or structure is located.

All previously approved lots of record may be improved subject
to the requirements of Sec. 10.02-A of this Ordinance.

space or minimum lot area allocated to any building shall by
virtue of change of ownership or for any other reason be used to
satisfy yard, other open space or minimum lot area requirements
for any other building.
2-6
2.02-B Division of Zoning Lot (Ord. 0-90-43) (Ord. O-94-04)
No zoning lot shall be hereafter divided into two (2) or more
zoning lots unless all zoning lots resulting from such division
shall conform with all the applicable bulk regulations of the
zoning district in which the property is located. If a lot is
built upon under one building permit, then divided, it can only
be so divided if each newly created lot, or portion of the
original lot, is platted as a numbered lot in a recorded
subdivision and conforms to the Subdivision Regulations of the
Village of Deerfield. No zoning lot within a residential
district shall be hereinafter divided so as to create a Lot-in-
Depth as that term is defined in Article 14.
2.02-C Location of Required Yards and Open Space
All yards and other open spaces allocated to a structure or use
shall be located on the same zoning lot as such structure or

right-of-way line shall be the front lot line on all
remaining through lots in that block.
2-7

standards contained in all applicable Village codes,
including, but not limited to, the Building Code, and the
applicable standards for TCSF that are published by the
Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to
time. The more stringent of the codes shall apply. If,
upon inspection, the Director concludes that a TCSF fails
to comply with any one or more of such codes and standards
and constitutes a danger to person or property, then upon
notice being provided to the owner or operator of the TCSF
and to the title holder of the property upon which the TCSF
is located, the owner, operator or title holder shall have
thirty (30) days to bring such TCSF into compliance with
such standards. If the owner, operator or title holder
fails to bring such TCSF into compliance within said thirty
(30) days, the village may cause such TCSF to be removed at
the expense of the owner, operator or title holder, as the
case may be.
2. Regulatory Compliance. All TCSF must meet the current
standards and regulations of the IEPA, if applicable, FAA,
the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal
government with the authority to regulate TCSF. If such
standards and regulations are changed, then the owners or
operators of the TCSF governed by this ordinance shall
bring such TCSF into compliance with such revised standards
and regulations within one hundred twenty (120) days of the
effective date of such change in standards and regulations,
unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by
the controlling agency. Failure to bring TCSF into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations
shall constitute grounds for the removal of the TCSF at the
2-25
expense of the owner, operator or title holder, as the case
may be. All Applicants for installation of TCSF must
provide the Director of Community Development Department
with a certificate of compliance from each agency, federal
or otherwise, having jurisdiction over the owner or
operator for the siting, construction, installation or
modification of the TCSF that the TCSF meets current
standards and regulations of the IEPA, if applicable, the
FAA, the FCC, or any other agency of the state or federal
government with authority to regulate TCSF.
3. Security. All TCSF shall be protected from unauthorized
access by appropriate security devices. A description of
proposed security measures shall be provided as part of any
application to site, construct, install or modify TCSF.
Additional measures may be required as a condition of the
issuance of any building permit as deemed necessary by the
Director.
4. Lighting. TCSF shall not be lighted unless required by the

enclosure shall be authorized unless the Police Department
and the appropriate Fire Department having jurisdiction
have issued a letter indicating that the location of all of
the above will not impede the provision of emergency
services to the property or the Village as a whole and the
proposed location is acceptable.
8. Utility Services. All utility service lines required for
the operation of a TCSF shall be installed under ground or,
2-26
if not feasible, shall be installed in such a manner so as
to create the least visual impact possible.
9. Compliance with Plans. Every TCSF antenna and antenna
support structure shall comply with all plans approved by
the Village.
10. Limited to Applicant. Every ordinance granting approval of
a special permit for a free-standing TCSF antenna or
antenna support structure shall state that any assignment
or transfer of the special permit or any rights thereunder
may be made only with the approval of the Board of
Trustees.
11. Term Limitation. Every ordinance granting approval of a
Special Use permit for a TCSF antenna or antenna support

5.02 C-2 OUTLYING COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
5.02-A District Description and Policies
1. Description
The C-2 Outlying Commercial District is a specialized
district established to permit and regulate commercial uses
which are essentially automobile oriented and which are
located outside of the Village Center. This District
recognizes that significant traffic problems exist along
adjoining arterial traffic routes, and that without careful
planning and design, such traffic problems may be acutely
intensified. The uses in this District will be carefully
regulated to control their impact upon public facilities
and other types of uses. Expansion of the C-2 Outlying
Commercial District will be discouraged except in areas
where significant considerations make the area particularly
suitable for this type of commercial development.
2. Policies
a. Planned Developments pursuant to Article 12 will be
encouraged.
b. Strip commercial development is the development of an
elongated commercial district which parallels a highway or
street and which may include, but is not limited to, one
or more of the following characteristics: shallow lot
depth with abutting non-commercial uses to the rear,
inadequate front yard landscaping, a proliferation of
ingress and egress points, inadequate sign control, and
inadequate provisions for off-street parking and loading
facilities. Creation of a new strip commercial
development will be discouraged. Extension of existing
strip commercial developments will be permitted only when
such development would constitute the sole reasonable use
of the property, where adequate buffering is provided and
where traffic flow and capacity will not be adversely
affected.
5-13
c. Safety and convenience in the public streets and highways
shall be protected by strict regulation of access points

by finding the area of the smallest single rectangle
which encompasses all of the signage panels and/or
signage elements comprising the sign face and any gaps of
spaces between any of the signage panels and/or signage
elements.
b. Decorative Framing
Where a wall sign consists of signage panels and/or
signage elements displayed so that they are either
enclosed or partially enclosed by a decorative frame, the
gross area of the sign face shall be computed by finding
the area of the smallest single rectangle which
encompasses all the signage elements and/or the signage
panels, any gaps or spaces between any of the signage
panels and/or signage elements, and the decorative frame.
9-8
c. Structural Supports/Sign Boxes
When a wall sign consists of signage panels or elements
displayed on a surface which is mounted in a sign box or
is mounted in some type of a support which is mounted on
the wall, the computation of the gross area of the sign
face will not include those structural supports or
components unless such structural supports or components
are designed in such a way so as to constitute signage
elements.
3. Gross Surface Area of a Ground Sign Face
a. Pole or Post Mounted Sign
(1) Single Surface Area Sign Face
The gross surface area of a sign face which is
comprised of signage panels or elements displayed on
a single surface shall be computed by determining the
gross surface area of the surface upon which the
signage panels or elements are displayed. The
structural supports or components shall not be
included in computing the area of the sign face if
they are located on the perimeter of the sign face.
All structural supports or components will be
included in the computation of the area of the sign
face if signage elements are displayed thereon.
(2) Multiple Surface Sign Face
If the sign face is comprised of multiple surfaces or
panels upon which signage panels or elements are
displayed, the gross surface area of the sign face
will be computed by finding the area of the smallest
single rectangle which encompasses all of the signage
surfaces, panels and/or elements, and any gaps or
spaces between the surfaces, elements or panels. The
structural supports or components shall not be
included in computing the area of the sign face if
they are located on the perimeter of the sign face.
All structural supports or components will be
included in the computation of the area of the sign
face if signage elements are displayed thereon.
(3) Floating Letter Sign
When a sign consists of letters, logos, or other
signage elements which are not displayed or mounted
on or against a surface but are held in place by a
bar or other similar support device, the area of the
sign face shall be computed by finding the area of
the smallest single rectangle which encompasses all
of the letters, logos, decorative frames or other
signage elements comprising the sign face. All gaps
9-9
and spaces between any of the letters, logos, or
other signage elements are to be included within the
rectangle.
(4) Architectural/Decorative Ornamentation
If architectural/decorative ornamentation is made a
part of a ground sign or is mounted on or attached to
a ground sign, then the gross area of the sign face
shall be computed by finding the area of the smallest
single rectangle which encompasses all of the signage
elements and/or panels and the
architectural/decorative ornamentation.
b. Monument Sign - Mounted on a Pedestal Base or Footing
(1) General Method
The gross surface area of a monument sign face shall
be the area of the surface of the monument upon which
the signage elements and/or signage panels are
mounted or displayed as measured from the top of the
sign face to the top of the pedestal, base, reveal,
or footing upon which the sign is mounted. When a
monument sign is mounted on a pedestal, base, reveal
or footing, the area of such pedestal, base, reveal
or footing shall be excluded in any computation of
the gross area of the sign unless signage elements or
signage panels are located thereon or such a
pedestal, base, reveal, or footing is designed in
such a way so as to constitute a signage element. If
any signage elements are displayed or are in any way
incorporated onto the pedestal, base, reveal or
footing, then the area of the sign face will be
determined by computing the area of the smallest
single rectangle which encompasses all of the
surfaces containing signage elements.
(2) Exception
If the pedestal, base, reveal, or footing extends
less than eighteen (18) inches above grade and no
signage elements or panels are located less than
eighteen (18) inches above grade, the area of the
sign face which is less than eighteen inches or less
above grade at the base of the sign will be excluded
in computing the area of the sign face.
(3) Structural Supports
Structural supports or components shall not be
included in computing the area of the sign face if
they are located on the perimeter of the sign face.
All structural supports or components will be
9-10
included in the computation of the area of the sign
face if signage elements are displayed thereon.
(4) Cut-Out Letter or Other Signage Elements
When the signage displayed on a pedestal, base, or
footing consists of cut-out letters or other signage
elements, the area of the sign face shall be computed
by finding the area of the smallest single rectangle
which encompasses all of the cut-out letters and
other signage elements. If any signage elements are
displayed or are in any way incorporated onto the
pedestal, base, or footing, then the rectangle must
be drawn so as to include all of the surfaces upon
which any signage is mounted. (See Article 9.01-
E,3,b,(2) for exceptions pertaining to the pedestal,
base, reveal, or footing.)
c. Signage Mounted on a Freestanding Wall
When signage elements are mounted on a freestanding wall,
the entire area of the side of the wall on which the
signage is mounted shall be included in the computation
of the area of the sign face. A freestanding wall
includes a wall which is not an integral part of a
building but is a wall which is designed solely as an
architectural amenity. (See Appendix II)

of the Village, including special attention to
traffic safety concerns. In no event may the sign be
closer than fifty (50) feet from the property line.
However, if the placement of the sign as permitted is not
feasible because of the location of buildings, berms,
swales, or other features of the development, the
Director of Community Development may authorize the sign
to be located less than fifty (50) feet from the property
line but only to the minimum extent necessary. Said sign
9-95
may be relocated from time to time if necessary because
of site work or construction occurring on the site but

swales, or other features of the development, the
Director of Community Development may approve the
placement of the sign at a grade other than the elevation
of the curb. In no event shall the overall height of the
sign from its base to its top exceed eight (8) feet in

provided, however, that no such sign shall be changed in
any manner that increases the nonconformity of such sign
with the provisions hereof established for signs in the
district in which the sign is located; and provided
further, that the burden of establishing a sign to be
nonconforming under this Article, rests entirely upon the
person or persons, firm or corporation claiming a
nonconforming status for a sign.
2. A sign which is nonconforming only by reason of its height
or size and does not exceed the standards of this Ordinance
in such respects by more than ten percent (10%), shall not
be subject to termination by amortization as hereinafter
provided.

10-1
ARTICLE 10
NONCONFORMITIES
10.00 PREAMBLE
This Ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is
an appropriate area for the location of the uses which are
permitted in that district. Within such districts, however,
there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and
characteristics of uses which were lawful before this Ordinance
was passed or amended, but which are prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments
hereto.
Recognizing both the legitimate interest of those who lawfully
established such a nonconformity and the need to protect the
public health, safety, comfort and general welfare, the
provisions of this Article are intended to provide for the
regulation of nonconformities within the following:
10.00-A It is the intent of this Article to permit most
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival.

shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere
in the same district.
10.00-C It is recognized and declared that those nonconformities
which substantially and adversely affect the orderly development,
maintenance, use and taxable value of other property in the
district (property that is itself subject to the regulations of
this Ordinance) should eventually be eliminated.

ARTICLE 12
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS AND PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS
12.00 PREAMBLE
12.00-A Intent (Ord. 0-82-10)
The intent of this Article is to permit and encourage a more
creative, imaginative and desirable approach to certain
residential, commercial and industrial developments than is
generally possible under conventional zoning regulations. By
allowing a greater flexibility of project design and by
supporting the union or planning and development, these
regulations seek to enhance the character of the Village in
accordance with the Village's goals as set forth in the
Comprehensive Plan. The flexibility permitted by these
regulations shall be utilized as a means to achieve a modern,
safe, efficient and visually appealing community, not simply as
a means to attract development or to circumvent the intent and
purposes of this Ordinance.
It is also the intent of this Article to continue to permit
Planned Residential Developments in that area bounded by Lake
Cook Road, Wilmot Road, Hackberry Road and Willow Avenue. A
planned residential development in this area is the use and
development for single-family detached residential purposes of a
compact and contiguous parcel or tract of land under single
ownership, or if the ownership is diverse, then under unified
control pursuant to an agreement of such owners. This parcel or
tract shall have sufficient area to permit its development in
accordance with an orderly plan with due allowance for the
similar development of adjoining properties, and in accordance
with the regulations and conditions prescribed in this Article.
Additionally, it is the intent of this Article to permit and
encourage the redevelopment of those properties lying between
the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad right-ofway
and Waukegan Road, which properties front on the west side
of Hoffman Lane, on Osterman Avenue, on Waverly Court or on
Central Avenue. A Village Center/Residential Planned Unit
Development in this area is for the use and development of
multiple-family dwellings. Also, a Village Center/Commercial
Planned Unit Development is restricted to those properties
fronting on the west side of Hoffman Lane or on the north side
of Osterman Avenue between Waukegan Road on the east and the
right-of-way of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific
Railroad on the west. The Village Center/Commercial Planned
Unit Development in this area is for the use and development of
those properties for office uses or for mixed use structures
containing a combination of office uses, commercial uses and/or
multiple-family dwellings.
12-2
12.00-B Objectives
The Planned Unit Development procedure has the following among
its objectives:
1. Flexibility and Variety
To promote flexibility in design and permit planned variety
in the type and location of structure and uses.
2. Efficiency and Economy
To promote the efficient use of land to facilitate a more
economic arrangement of buildings, parking, circulation
systems and utilities.
3. Site Character
To provide a procedure which can relate the type, design
and layout of residential, commercial and industrial
development to the particular site, thereby encouraging
preservation to the greatest extent possible of the site's
natural character, its landscape and topography.
4. Open Space and Amenities
To provide for more usable and suitably located
recreational facilities and open space and other public and
common facilities than would otherwise be provided under
the strict application of conventional zoning.
5. Assurances
To assure the Village, and future occupants and future
owners of Planned Unit Developments that the amenities,
circulation systems, utilities, and other components of the
approved plan including those usually provided as public
improvements will be established in accordance with the
approved final development plan and with other requirements
placed on the Planned Unit Development.
12.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS
12.01-A Planned Unit Development As Special Use
Planned Unit Development may be approved and authorized by
Ordinance as a Special Use in R-5, General Residence District
and in all Commercial and Industrial Districts in accordance
with the standards and procedures of this Article.
12.01-B Applicable Regulations
1. Exceptions (Ord. O-85-09)
12-3
A Planned Unit Development shall be governed by the
regulations of the zoning district or districts in which it
is located, except as provided in this Article and as
modified by and authorized in the Ordinance approving the
Planned Unit Development. Said Ordinance may provide for
such exceptions from the District regulations governing
setbacks, lot width, height, parking and subdivision design
standards as may be desirable to achieve the objectives of
the proposed Planned Unit Development, provided such
exceptions are consistent with the standards and criteria
contained in this Article.
2. Improvements (Ord. 0-93-53)
In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Planned
Unit Development and the Village of Deerfield, the Village
may determine that the best interests of the Village are
served by permitting the provision of certain improvements
as private rather than public improvements. It may also be
determined that such improvements should be permitted at
less than those specifications set out in the Zoning
Ordinance, Deerfield Subdivision Code or the Municipal Code
of Deerfield. Such exceptions shall be permitted at the
discretion of the Corporate Authorities. The Corporate
Authorities shall also determine the extent to which such
improvements will be publicly owned and maintained. Such
improvements shall include but shall not be limited to
streets, sidewalks, street lights, fire hydrants, utility
lines, and landscaping. The Corporate Authorities shall
require the establishment of funds in accordance with the
provisions of Article 12.09 and the Municipal Code to
guarantee the establishment and completion of all
improvements, whether private or public, as approved in the
final development plan.
Additionally, improvements other than those listed above
which are approved as part of the final development plan
shall be deemed to be included as private improvements and
governed by Article 12.01-G. Such improvements may include
landscaping, fencing, and site amenities. The Corporate
Authorities may grant exceptions to these requirements.
3. Subdivision or Resubdivision (Ord. 0-88-54)
Furthermore, in those Planned Unit Developments where the
subdivision or resubdivision of the subject property is
desired, said subdivision and resubdivision may be granted
although the lots so created do not each meet all of the
Village's requirements as found in the Zoning Ordinance,
Subdivision Code, or Municipal Code.
Such subdivision or resubdivision shall only be approved if
the purpose for creating said subdivision or resubdivision
12-4
is to reflect the differing ownership of the lots within
the Planned Unit Development. Said subdivision or
resubdivision will not create any rights not specifically
permitted by the ordinance establishing the Planned Unit
Development. If any changes to the governing Planned Unit
Development are desired, i.e. provision of fencing, such
changes may only be made upon the recommendation of the
Plan Commission following a public hearing and approval of
the Board of Trustees. Any lots in said subdivision or
resubdivision which will be reserved for the use and/or
benefit of all of the owners of lots within the PUD shall
be clearly marked accordingly on the subdivision or
resubdivision plat along with any additional language which
the Village deems appropriate to indicate the use for which
the lots are reserved and also that said lots do not
constitute a "lot of record" as that term is defined by
either the Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision Code and further
that the only improvement which will be permitted on said
lot is that which is authorized by the governing Planned
Unit Development Ordinance. If, after the adoption and
recording of the Planned Unit Development Ordinance and
subdivision or resubdivision plat, no substantial
construction has begun or no use has been established in
the Planned Unit Development within the time stated in the
development schedule contained in the Final Development
Plan thereby causing the Special Use to expire, the Village
Board may automatically vacate the subdivision or
resubdivision plat.
12.01-C Effect of Approval
1. Approval of a Planned Unit Development for a tract of land
shall not affect the rights of the property owner or owners
to develop the property in conformance with the provisions
of the underlying zoning district.
2. However, when a Planned Unit Development has been granted
and conditions and guarantees imposed, as hereinafter
provided, and site development of such Planned Unit
Development has commenced:
a. The rights of the property owner or owners to develop the
property in conformance with the provisions of the
underlying zoning district are forfeit, and there shall
be the obligation to complete the Planned Unit
Development as set forth on the Final Development Plan
and related regulations approved as part of the Ordinance
granting the Planned Unit Development, or
b. A new Final Development plan shall be required for any
further development of the site.
12.01-D Coordination with Subdivision Ordinance
12-5
When any Planned Unit Development requires the subdivision or
resubdivision of land, the review of the proposed subdivision or
resubdivision under the Subdivision Ordinance of the Village of
Deerfield shall proceed simultaneously with the review of the
Planned Unit Development under this Zoning Ordinance.
12.01-E General Standards and Criteria
All Planned Unit Developments shall meet the following general
standards and criteria:
1. Village Planning Goals
A Planned Unit Development must be compatible with and
implement the planning goals and objectives of the Village
as contained in the Comprehensive Plan and other pertinent

health, welfare and safety and shall comply with the
provisions of the Deerfield Subdivision Ordinance unless
variations therefrom are granted by the Board of Trustees.

The design of a Planned Unit Development shall reflect a
sensitivity to the natural environment. All plans shall,
to the fullest extent possible, provide for protection of
both the function and aesthetics of the natural
environment, which shall include, but not be limited to,
conditions pertaining to flood plains, soil and geologic
characteristics and preservation of existing vegetation.

through-traffic.
2. Internal Circulation
The design of internal circulation systems must be
sensitive to such points as safety, convenience, access to
dwelling units or non-residential facilities, separation of

established for the area formed by those properties lying
between the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad
right-of-way and Waukegan Road, which properties front on the
west side of Hoffman Lane, on Osterman, on Waverly Court, or on
Central Avenue. Those provisions are established to further the
following specific purposes:
1. To provide an incentive for the redevelopment of this area
utilizing the Village Center/Residential PUD procedures for
the use and development of multi-family dwellings.
2. To provide for the redevelopment of the area formed by
those properties between the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul,
and Pacific Railroad right-of-way and Waukegan Road, which
properties front on the west side of Hoffman Lane, or on
the north side of Osterman utilizing the Village
Center/Commercial Planned Unit Development procedures for
the use and development of those properties for any office
uses and for mixed use structures containing office uses
and multi-family dwellings.
3. To provide good access, both pedestrian and vehicular, to
the properties throughout the area and to the commercial
areas to the north and east.
4. To provide pedestrian amenities and open space in order to
produce a more attractive area.
In furthering the above, three specific categories of public
amenities will be considered in determining the amount of
development incentives to be given:
12-25
1. Open space amenities which could include wider setbacks
than those required, public plazas and parks, enclosed
parking, or other items which would serve to increase the
amount and quality of useable open space in a particular
development.
2. Traffic and pedestrian amenities which would serve to
enhance the traffic and pedestrian flow which could include
open arcades, wider sidewalks, or interconnections with
surrounding developments.
3. Use amenities which include developing properties with
those uses designated in the Village's Comprehensive Plan
and specifically developing a lot as part of the
development, which lot by reason of its location between
other parcels under common ownership, would otherwise be
rendered undevelopable.
12.07-B Maximum Development Incentives Allowed

possible, but in no event shall the incentives permit
development in excess of the following limitations:
1. The maximum building height is limited to 55 feet.
2. The maximum ground coverage permitted if the majority of
the required parking is provided within the building shall
not exceed 50%.
3. The maximum reduction in required setbacks shall be limited
to that which is necessary to provide adequate fire
protection for the particular building proposed.
12.07-C Criteria

granted for the inclusion of any amenity, the following are to
be considered:
1. The amount of floor area by which the total floor area of
the building is reduced due to the inclusion of the
amenity.
2. The direct construction cost of the amenity.
3. The amount of continuing maintenance required for the
amenity.
4. The degree to which the inclusion of the amenity furthers
the objectives of the Village Center/Residential Planned
12-26
Unit Development District or the Village Center/Commercial
Planned Unit Development District.
12.07-D Procedure
1. Application
Development incentives may be approved and authorized by
ordinance as part of the Special Use granted for either
Village Center/Residential Planned Unit Development or a

Planned Unit Development. Such application will include
any plans and drawings and documentation necessary to
determine the amount of development incentives to be given.
2. Recommendation of the Plan Commission

amenities forming the basis of the development amenities are
insured. Said conditions may include provisions for restrictive
covenants and the posting of surety bonds, escrow deposits or
similar financial guarantees to achieve these objectives.
Failure of an applicant to comply with such conditions may

conditions have been met:

That the variation does not permit a use otherwise excluded
from the particular district in which requested.
