VILLAGE OF ROUND LAKE, ILLINOIS MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Village of Round Lake, Illinois 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Village of Round Lake, Illinois Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Jeanne Kristan, former village clerk. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    The most recent Ordinance in this Supplement is Ordinance 19-O-07, passed May 6, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

2.04.070 - Board of trustees procedure. 
    The following rules shall govern meetings of the board of trustees: 
A.  Speaking on the Question. For matters of discussion on which there will be no motion, ordinance or resolution, no member shall speak more than twice on the same question without unanimous consent of the board, nor more than once until every member wishing to speak shall have spoken. Statements on such matters shall be limited to five minutes. 
B.  Voting. Every member present when a question is taken, shall vote "aye" or "nay", unless excused by a majority of the board, or unless he or she may be directly interested in the question, in which case he or she shall not vote and be counted as an abstention. In those cases where state law does not require an affirmative vote, a vote of "abstain", "present", or "pass" shall be counted as a vote with the prevailing side of the matter voted upon. Every motion shall be reduced to writing if the president or any member desires it. 
C.  Question to be Stated. Every question or motion when seconded shall be stated by the president distinctly before it is open for debate. The president may call any member to perform the duties of the chair, but such substitution shall not extend beyond an adjournment. 
D.  Votes to be Recorded. If any member requires it, the ayes and nays upon any question shall be taken and entered on the journal. 
E.  Motion to Table. Any trustee may move to postpone a matter indefinitely or to a date certain. The form of the motion shall be "move to table" or "move to postpone". The motion must be seconded and receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present to be adopted. The motion is not debatable. Any matter postponed indefinitely pursuant to this section may be placed on a future agenda by direction of the village president or by the direction of the board of trustees pursuant to a motion. There shall be no "motion to lay upon the table" as that motion is known in Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised. 
F.  Clerk to Forward Papers. The clerk shall forward all papers to the appropriate committee and officers, as early as the third day after the reference shall have been made. 
G.  Action on Motions, Resolutions, Ordinances. 
1.  Any ordinance or resolution may be adopted at the same meeting at which it is introduced, unless otherwise prohibited by law. 
2.  Motions. No motion, resolution or ordinance shall be put or debated in the village board or in committee unless it is so moved by a trustee and seconded. When a motion is seconded, it shall be stated by the presiding officer before debate. 
3.  Initial Debate. The presiding officer shall then open the floor for debate and the movant shall have the floor for debate on the subject for not more than five minutes. After the movant finishes speaking on his or her motion, each trustee shall have the floor in an order determined by the presiding officer for not more than five minutes. Trustees may not defer their opportunity for debate. The presiding officer may debate any matter before the village board after all trustees present have had the opportunity for debate. 
4.  Additional Debate and Calling the Question. After initial debate as set forth above, the presiding officer may call for a vote or may allow additional debate in his or her discretion. However, after initial debate, any trustee may move to "call the question" and terminate debate. Upon receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority of the trustees present, a motion to call the question shall immediately terminate debate and the clerk shall call the roll on the question before the village board. If the presiding officer has decided to put the question to a vote and not allow additional debate, any member may move to extend debate for an additional round of debate as set forth in paragraph 2 above. A motion to extend debate shall carry upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the trustees present. 
5.  Recognition of Non-Members. The presiding officer may recognize the clerk, treasurer, village administrator, village attorney or any member of the staff or public during debate. A majority of all members present may override the presiding officer' decision of whether or not to recognize any non-member. 
6.  Upon the vote on any question, the clerk shall record the votes in the journal of proceedings (minutes) by listing each trustee and his or her corresponding vote by name. A vote to adjourn may be recorded as a voice vote. 
H.  Reconsideration of Motions. A motion to reconsider must be made by a trustee who voted with the prevailing side on the matter. It may be seconded by any other trustee and must receive an affirmative vote of four trustees to be adopted. The motion to reconsider may be made at the same meeting at which the reconsidered item was addressed or not later than the first regular meeting following the meeting at which the reconsidered item was addressed. No question that has been once decided and reconsidered, and decided a second time, shall again be considered. 
I.  Written Communications. Written communications received by the village need not be read in full but the clerk may report the substance thereof only to the board and thereafter the president may refer the communication to the appropriate committee; provided, however, that any such communication shall be read in full and separately acted upon by the board if so requested by the president or any member of the board. Upon completion of the reading or reporting of all communications a motion shall be made and a vote taken relative to the referrals of such communications made by the president. 
J.  Consensus Action. To the extent allowed at law, the presiding officer may declare that an action be taken pursuant to consent of the village board and direct that said action be recorded in the minutes "by consensus" or some such similar designation. Upon such a declaration by the presiding officer, any trustee may immediately, prior to the next agenda item, voice his or her objection to proceeding by consensus. In the event of such an objection, there shall be no consensus action and the village president may call for a motion on such matter in the manner set forth in this code for action on motions. 
K.  Claims Against the village. No claim shall be allowed unless it has been filed in the office of the clerk on or before the Thursday preceding the date that it is to be presented to the board for its approval. This rule shall not apply to the regular semi-monthly payroll of the officers and employees of the village, or to the payment of claims which are authorized to be paid by special resolution. 
L.  Robert's Rules of Order. The rules contained in this village code shall be the rules of procedure for the village board of trustees and its committees. To the extent that these rules are silent on a matter, the rules of parliamentary practice comprised in the latest published edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, shall govern the village board in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the special rules of the village board or the statutes or laws of the state. 
M.  Conduct of Visitors. No person, acting for himself or herself or another, shall be allowed upon the floor of the board (meaning that portion in front of the railing) while any legislation is pending before the board in which the abovementioned parties are interested. 
N.  Members Not to Leave Seats. No member of the board shall leave his or her seat during a meeting without first obtaining permission of the chair. 
O.  Changes in Procedure. These rules of procedure shall not be repealed, altered, amended or suspended, unless by the concurrence of two-thirds of all the trustees elected.

A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

(Ord. 04-O-13 § 1; prior code § 43A-7) 
9.24.020 - Truancy. 
A.  Purpose. The corporate authorities of the village find, determine and declare as follows: 
1.  There has been a general increase in crimes, including violent crimes committed by juveniles in the metropolitan area of northeastern Illinois, as well as through the nation. The increase in juvenile activity is partly attributable to an increase in the juvenile truancy rate. The village has been adversely affected by both in the increase in juvenile crime and in the increase in juvenile truancy; 
2.  The Round Lake police department must expend its already overburdened resources to supervise detained juveniles resulting from crimes such as truancy, curfew violations and other wilful misconduct, and the resources expended on such supervision are extraordinary and far exceed the costs expended in performing normal police and community services; 
3.  That school officials and other municipal officials of the five villages comprising the Round Lake area have been frustrated in attempts to combat juvenile violence, gang related influence upon juveniles and other infractions of state and local laws and ordinances by children. That truancy is a serious contributing factor to such problems. Expeditious intervention is necessary in order to remedy such concerns of officials and parents and that inter-village cooperation and enforcement in conjunction with parental cooperation and involvement is needed in partnership with the Round Lake area community's schools; 
4.  In response to these concerns the village deems it appropriate and necessary to adopt the following provisions. 
B.  1.  Truancy Prohibited. It is unlawful for any person eighteen (18) years of age or younger who is required by law to attend school and who is subject to the compulsory attendance requirements of the Illinois School Code, and/or enrolled in a public, private (including a home school) or parochial school, to absent himself or herself from attendance at school during the hours in which he or she is enrolled, including summer school, without parental permission or the permission of such student's school authorities. 
2.  Minors in Public Place Prohibited. It is unlawful for any person eighteen (18) years of age or younger who is required by law to attend school and who is subject to the compulsory attendance requirements of the Illinois School Code and/or enrolled in a public, private (including a home school) or parochial school to absent himself or herself from attendance at school during the hours in which he or she is enrolled, including summer school, without parental permission or the permission of such student's school authorities and found in a public place, as defined in this section. 
    For purposes of this subsection a minor is absent from school and found in a public place if the minor is found loitering, wandering, idling, strolling, playing or aimlessly driving or riding about in or upon any public street, avenue, road, highway, curb area, alley, park, playground, public place or public building, place of amusement or eating place, vacant lot or unsupervised place or any place open to the public within the village during the hours of the same day when the minor's school is in session. 
3.  Exemptions. The provisions of subsections (B)(1) and (2) of this section shall not apply when: 
a.  The minor has in his or her possession a written excuse from the minor's parent(s), legal guardian(s), or other adult person(s) having the legal care or custody of the minor, which provides a reasonable explanation under the circumstances considering the time of the day, the conduct being engaged in at the time by the minor and other observable factors so as to determine the validity of the minor's absence from school; 
b.  The minor is accompanied by his or her parent(s), legal guardian(s) or other adult person(s) having the legal care or custody of the minor;

A.  Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information: 
1.  The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property. 
2.  A statement that the chief of police has information that the property may be chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the nuisance activities that may exist or that have occurred.

3.  Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of police within ten (10) days to discuss the nuisance activities. 
B.  After complying with the notification procedures described herein, if the chief of police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a third nuisance activity at or within a property and determines that the property has become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police shall:

d.  Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage pre-paid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of determination by the chief of police. 
e.  A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such address, as shown on the tax rolls of Lake County, Illinois, and/or the occupant at the address of the property, if these persons are different that the person in charge, and shall be made either personally of by first class mail, postage prepaid. 
f.  A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after ten (10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the chief of police.

If the property is registered under the village's rental property inspection ordinance, then a notice shall be delivered to the person registered under such an ordinance as the owner or manager of said property. For purposes of this subsection, delivered means the mailing of said notice by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The date of such mailing shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. 
h.  The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise effect the proceedings under this chapter. 
2.  If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by the village pursuant to the chapter, a person in charge stipulates with the chief of police that the person in charge will pursue a course of action that both parties will agree abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a period of not less that ten (10) ten nor more than thirty (30) days. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within thirty (30) days, the chief of police shall request authorization for the prosecuting attorneys of the Village of Round Lake to commence a legal proceeding to abate the nuisance. 
3.  Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the chief of police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any other documentation which supports legal proceedings, to the corporation counsel.

C.  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may consider any of the following factors, if they find appropriate, and shall site those found applicable:

B.  In the event that the court finds that the property constitutes a chronic nuisance property as defined in Section 12.13.010, the court may order the remedy set out above or any other remedy it deems appropriate and just. In addition, in the event that it also finds a person in charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or violating this chapter and permitted the activities to occur, the court may assess a civil fine as provided above. 
C.  The court may authorize the Village of Round Lake to physically secure the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event that the village is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect the closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property. If used herein, costs mean those costs actually incurred by the village for the physical securing of the property, as well as tenant relocation costs. 
D.  The Village of Round Lake building and/or pubic works department employee affecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs and the Village of Round Lake shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property. 
E.  Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof by the village. 
F.  A tenant is entitled to his/her reasonable relocation costs, as those are determined by the court, if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into the property after either:

2.  Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought pursuant to this section.

If the village clerk receives an application for more than one parade or open air meeting in a single day, he or she may set a time for the duration of each parade or open air meeting which time shall not, without the consent of the group seeking the permit, be less than three hours. 
    The village clerk shall issue permits for more than a single parade during one day in accordance with the requirements of Section 12.28.060 of this chapter; provided, however, that he or she may not issue multiple permits beyond the point at which the issuance of an additional permit would require the continuing diversion of so great a number of police officers or other municipal personnel so as to prevent normal police protection or other services to the municipality. A single permit may cover more than one group or person if the identity is properly reported on the application. 
(Prior code § 32.10(g))

Chapter 12.32 - STREET TREES 
Sections: 

12.32.010 - Street tree planting in subdivisions. 
A.  Minimum Requirements. As a minimum, a street tree planting plan is to be prepared either by a professional landscape architect licensed by the state or an urban forester/arborist or other professional acceptable to the village administrator or his/her designee. 
B.  Standard Format and Submission. 
1.  The plan shall be at the same scale as the subdivision/site engineering plan. 
2.  Show the calculation of the number of required street trees. 
3.  The plan should be submitted with the preliminary engineering plans. 
C.  Tree Selections. 
1.  All trees selected shall be grown in a nursery located in the northern half of the state. 
2.  The grade of all planting stock shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the "American Standard for Nursery Stock" published by the American Association of Nurserymen. 
3.  The village reserves the right to inspect and tag trees selected by the developer for planting at the nursery before any trees are dug. 
4.  All trees selected shall be healthy and free of insects, diseases, bark bruises and scrapes on the trunk or limbs before planting. 
5.  Each tree selected shall be consistent in form and character with the species and shall have a straight trunk with limbs not lower than six feet above the ground. 
6.  All trees selected shall have a caliper of not less than two and one-half inches. 
7.  Trees to be planted in the parkway shall be based on spacing at forty (40) feet unless otherwise approved. 
D.  General Planting Standards. 
1.  All required trees shall be planted during the spring and fall planting season. 
2.  All required trees shall be planted in accordance with the village planting standards found in the village of Round Lake Tree and Landscape Manual. 
3.  All required trees shall be selected from the village's permitted species list and will not include species on the village's prohibited species list as found in the village of Round Lake Tree and Landscape Manual. 
E.  Acceptance. Street trees are part of the subdivision improvements and will be inspected for acceptance by the village along with the other subdivision improvements. Prior to requesting an acceptance inspection: 
1.  Dead trees and trees that do not meet horticultural standards shall be removed and replaced. 
2.  Trees with dead, broken or unacceptable limbs shall be pruned. 
3.  All trees shall have three inches of mulch over the root ball. 
F.  Required Maintenance. The developer shall be fully responsible for the maintenance (in a healthy, flourishing condition) of all trees required to be planted until the end of a two-year maintenance period following acceptance of the improvements by the village. In the case of those trees which are replaced during the two-year maintenance period and which will not have been in the ground for two years at the expiration date of the two-year maintenance period (the time required to ensure the village that they will continue to flourish once they are being maintained by the village), the developer shall be required to post cash with the village as a guarantee, as set forth in subsection (F)(4) of this section. 
1.  In order to ensure that trees are being maintained in the manner required, the village shall cause all new development trees, including the existing trees to be preserved and protected, to be inspected by the village forester on a periodic basis. The findings of the village forester shall be reported to the developer with specific requirements for corrective action, which shall be immediately implemented by the developer. The village forester shall also maintain a record of those trees replaced and the date of their replacement. 
2.  Since the building construction activities associated with the new development can endanger the well-being of those trees planted by the developer, as well as those trees which are to be preserved and protected, developers are encouraged to require individual builders or contractors to post bonds with them which can be used to pay for tree replacement, if necessary. In no event shall the village assume the role of arbitrator in determining the party responsible for damage. Notwithstanding the above, the developer shall remain responsible for the health and vitality of all trees required to be planted or preserved and protected until the end of the required maintenance period set forth in this chapter and the village of Round Lake Municipal Code. 
3.  The developer shall be required to replace those trees which have become so damaged, deformed, diseased or otherwise unhealthy that they do not meet industry standards or that the village has good reason to believe they cannot survive in good condition. The determination of the village shall be based on the recommendation of the village forester and shall be final. 
a.  Where tree replacement is required by the village, planting shall occur during the current planting season, if possible, and, if not, then in the next planting season following notification by the village. 
b.  The size and quality of replacement trees shall be equal to or better than the size and quality of the trees to be replaced, as approved by the village forester. 
4.  As set forth above, there will be instances when the developer is required to replace trees during the two-year maintenance period, and as a result, the village will be afforded less than two years to monitor the health and vigor of these trees in order to ensure that it will be assuming responsibility for trees which will continue to grow and flourish. Therefore, prior to the expiration of the two-year maintenance period and prior to the release of the letter of credit or other security required by this chapter, for each tree which has been in the ground less than two years at the expiration of the two-year maintenance period, the developer shall be held responsible for a period of two years following the expiration of such two-year maintenance period. 
a.  The purpose of the required cash bond shall be to ensure against loss due to improper planting techniques, disease or lack of proper maintenance by the developer. 
b.  The amount of the required cash bond shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the then-current replacement cost of each tree to be guaranteed. 
c.  At least four months prior to the expiration of the required maintenance period, the village forester, using the record of tree replacement dates, shall prepare a report to the village engineer listing those trees for which a cash bond is required. This report shall include the date the tree was planted, the current replacement cost of the tree, and the current condition of the tree. 
d.  The developer shall be notified in writing by the village engineer of the required amount of the cash bond. Such notice shall include a copy of the village forester's detailed report. Any disagreement between the developer and the village forester regarding the number of trees to be guaranteed of the required amount shall be resolved by the village engineer not less than two months prior to the expiration of the required maintenance period and the expiration of the required letter of credit or other security. 
e.  Not less than one month prior to the expiration of the required maintenance period and the expiration of the required letter of credit or other security, if the developer has not deposited the required cash bond with the village, the amount of such cash bond shall be drawn from the developer's security to be held by the village for purposes herein set forth. 
f.  For all such trees for which a cash bond has been deposited with the village, the village forester shall continue to conduct inspections on a periodic basis. The findings of the village forester shall be reported to the village (with a copy to the developer) with specified requirements for corrective action. Corrective action of a maintenance nature shall be immediately implemented by the village at its own expense. If, however, the only proper corrective action, in the opinion of the village forester, is replacement, the cost for such replacement shall be drawn from the cash bond following written notice to the developer and, after replacement, any fund for that tree shall be released to the developer. Notice shall be given by depositing the same in U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the developer or his or her authorized agent at such address as is shown on the most current records of the village. Receipt of such notice shall be conclusively presumed from proof of mailing. 
g.  At the end of the two-year period following the expiration of the two-year maintenance period, any cash funds remaining on deposit with the village as a tree guarantee shall be released to the developer.

B.  If the village forester, upon his or her review of the tree permit application, concurs that the owner's actions were warranted, no further action under these regulations shall be necessary, but if the village forester determines that no genuine tree emergency existed to justify the cutting or removal of the protected tree(s), then such actions by the owner shall be deemed a violation of these regulations. 
(Ord. 06-O-10 § 1 (part)) 
12.36.210 - Penalty. 
    Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be punished by a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each such violation, and a separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each protected tree unlawfully removed and/or not replaced in violation of this chapter, and a separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each day that such violation exists.

The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with Section 12.42.210 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. 
(Ord. 07-O-56 § 2 (part))

A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.

B.  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village.

Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase. 
D.  Withdrawals. The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period.

2.  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;

E.  Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this section. 
F.  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection C of this section. 
G.  Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
H.  Rights not Limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have.

If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
2.  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the director of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately. 
3.  In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public. 
C.  Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within forty-eight (48) hours after an emergency repair. 
(Ord. 07-O-56 § 2 (part)) 
12.42.220 - Variances. 
A.  Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the director of public works as a part of the permit application.

B.  Authority to Grant Variances. The director of public works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis. 
C.  Conditions for Granting of Variance. The director of public works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
1.  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
2.  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
D.  Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the director of public works may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
E.  Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the director of public works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The village board shall timely decide the appeal.

There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. 
(Ord. 07-O-56 § 2 (part)) 
12.42.240 - Enforcement. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter. 
(Ord. 07-O-56 § 2 (part)) 
12.42.250 - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

12.46.40 - Collocation requirements and conditions. 
1.  Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
2.  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this ordinance. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
3.  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
    A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
    Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
    If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
    The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the code of federal regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
4.  The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
    However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
    For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
5.  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. All wireless providers, including their designees and subcontractors, shall comply with all village requirements. The village shall have the right to reserve, maintain and enforce public safety space as designated by the village from time to time. 
6.  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way. Design standards include but are not limited to: 
a.  Pole mounted equipment shall be installed a minimum of 8 feet from the ground; 
b.  All pole mounted equipment and mounting hardware shall be painted to match the structure on which it is mounted;

e.  Any new poles shall be of the same style pole located in the area, which may be decorative poles. 
f.  The wireless provide shall work with the village to minimize visual clutter. This includes, but is not limited to, alternate pole and ground equipment placement, use of decorative or stealth poles, and other reasonable means of concealing or limiting the visual impact of small wireless equipment. This requirement shall be required in residential zones and for historical districts or landmarks. 
7.  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
    If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
8.  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
    New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
a.  ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  forty five (45) feet above ground level. 
9.  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in chapter 17.96 of Title 17, Zoning, of the Municipal Code. 
10.  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
11.  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
12.  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
13.  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
14.  Removal of equipment. All equipment shall be removed and property restored within ninety (90) days of permit ending or equipment no longer in use, whichever occurs first.

The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and reporting required by the village. At such times as deemed necessary, the village reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis. 
I.  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association and "USEPA Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants" pursuant to 40 CFR Part 136 and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customary accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite sample or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composite samples, whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.) 
J.  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance with the applicable ordinance governing sewer user service charges.

13.26.060 - Ultimate responsibility. 
    The standards set forth in this chapter and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are minimum standards; therefore this chapter does not intend, nor imply, that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination or pollution of stormwater or unauthorized discharge of pollutants to the stormwater drainage system or to waters of the United States. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 6, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.070 - Discharge prohibitions. 
A.  Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the stormwater drainage system or waters or the United States any materials, pollutants, or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards. 
    The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal discharge to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
1.  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this chapter: water line flushing, fire hydrant flushing, discharges from potable water sources, landscape irrigation, lawn watering, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, diverted stream flows, natural riparian habitat and wetland flows, springs, storm sewer cleaning water, street wash water from streets where spills or leaks of pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials has not occurred (unless the pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials have been removed), foundation drains, footing drains, crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, noncommercial vehicle washing, routing external building washing that does not use detergents, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges (discharges must contain less than one part per million chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials. 
2.  Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
3.  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. 
4.  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and all other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted by the authorized enforcement agency for the discharge to the stormwater drainage system. 
B.  Prohibition of Illicit Connections. The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage or any other non-stormwater discharge to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 7, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.080 - Suspension of MS4 access. 
A.  Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The village of Round Lake may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to the MS4, or to waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States and to minimize danger to persons. 
B.  Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator, in writing, of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. 
    A person violates this chapter if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 8, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.090 - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an NPDES construction site activities permit or NPDES industrial activities permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Said person shall submit to the village of Round Lake a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) that was provided to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA). Additional proof of compliance with an NPDES construction site activities permit or NPDES industrial activities permit may be required, in a form acceptable to the village of Round Lake, prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 9, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.100 - Monitoring of discharges. 
A.  The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect premises subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
B.  Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination, copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit, and the performance of any additional duties as required by state and federal law. 
C.  The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any premises such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the premises' stormwater discharge. 
D.  The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
E.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the premises to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
F.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a premises is a violation of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation of this chapter if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. 
G.  If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 10, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.110 - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
    The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the stormwater drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner, or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment, shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal stormwater drainage system or waters of the United States through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 11, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.120 - Watercourse protection. 
    Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 12, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.130 - Notification of spills. 
    Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or any person responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information regarding any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or in pollutants entering stormwater, the stormwater drainage system, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person, by phone, or by facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the village of Round Lake within three business days of the phone call or personal notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(Ord. No. 10-O-28, § 13, 6-21-2010) 
13.26.140 - Notice of violation. 
    Whenever the village of Round Lake finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation: 
A.  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;

B.  If there is more than one (1) building and/or unit in or on the facility in which FOG production occurs, each building and/or unit shall have its own grease interceptor sized in conformance with the design criteria of this section; however, if the buildings and/or units, but not necessarily the individual businesses, in or on the facility are owned by a single party or entity, (property owner), then a single grease interceptor that has been sized to the cumulative criteria for each individual build ing and/or unit, in conformance with the design criteria set forth in the following section, is acceptable. The property owner is responsible for payment of fines and correcting any violation issues. 
C.  Grease interceptors shall not be required for private residences or dwellings. 
D.  Prohibited discharge to a grease interceptor includes but is not limited to the following: 
1.  All washroom facilities; 
2.  All food waste grinders; 
3.  All commercial dish washing machines. 
E.  Interior grease interceptors are prohibited. 
F.  All miscellaneous sinks, slop-sinks, floor drains, water wash hoods, etc. located in a kitchen area shall be plumbed to connect into a grease interceptor. 
G.  A permit will be required before construction of a grease interceptor can begin. To obtain a permit, four (4) complete sets of plans shall be submitted to the village community development department, with the permit application and a NWRWRF business disclosure form (as from time to time issued and revised). The plans shall include a site plan and an interceptor detail showing size, type and location of each interceptor proposed with detailed plumbing. The community development department shall approve the plans that are in conformance with design criteria including size, type and location of the interceptor prior to any construction at the proposed site. 
H.  Included with the permit application, the permittee will receive a grease interceptor permit information attachment, providing additional information and guidelines. The permit information attachment will require signature by permittee, acknowledging the receipt and understanding of the guidelines within. This ordinance incorporates this attachment as the village's guidelines and requirements and may be periodically updated by enforcement officer. 
I.  Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected such that it is easily accessible at all times for inspection, cleaning, and the removal of intercepted grease. The grease interceptor(s) shall be located as close to the source as practical, however it must be outside the facility served a minimum of five (5) feet away from the building. Prior to any construction on the proposed site, the community development department shall approve the location of any grease interceptor. 
J.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, a FOG producing facility which does not use fats, oils or greases in the preparation, processing, manufacturing, packaging or serving of food will be exempt from installing a grease interceptor, but shall meet best management practices (BMPs) as specified in the grease interceptor permit information attachment as from time to time issued and revised by the village as a guide to compliance. 
K.  Grease interceptors and/or manholes must be installed by a plumber licensed in the state of Illinois.

(Ord. 99-O-29 § 1 (part): prior code § 22.401) 
(Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
16.12.030 - Lots, blocks, buildings and parking areas. 
A.  Lots. 
1.  Political Boundaries. Lots shall be laid out so that they do not cross any political boundary, especially any school district boundary or the boundaries of the village. 
2.  Arrangement. The lots shall be arranged so that there are no foreseeable difficulties with regard to topography or other conditions, for purposes of the issuance of building permits. The lots shall be arranged to provide driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved and dedicated street. 
3.  Lot Dimensions. 
a.  Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of Title 17 of this code. 
b.  Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the plan commission may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential future lots. 
c.  In general side lot lines shall be right angles (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule shall give a better street or lot plan. 
d.  Building set-back lines shall conform to the front yard requirements of Title 17 of this code, with corner lots observing the minimum front yard requirements from both streets. 
e.  The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in Title 17. 
f.  Residential lots abutting an expressway, major arterial, railroad right-of-way or other inharmonious use shall have an easement (landscape) width or depth of twenty (20) feet, adjacent to such expressway, major arterial, railroad right-of-way or other inharmonious use in excess of the width or depth required by Title 17 for that district. A landscape easement shall be required on such lots across the twenty-foot strip of land and shall be designated on the final plat as follows: "This strip is reserved for landscape screening. The placement of structures hereon or vehicular access here across is prohibited." 
g.  Lots abutting a water course, drainage way channel, or stream shall have a minimum width or depth required to provide adequate building site and the minimum usable area for front, side, and rear yards, as required in Title 17, with the building foundation two feet above flood level as measured from the maximum high water line. 
h.  For lots abutting a water course, drainage way channel, or stream, lot lines should be placed in the centerline thereof. 
4.  Access. 
a.  All lots shall abut a publicly dedicated street. 
b.  Double frontage and reserve frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major streets or highways or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
c.  Driveway access onto a major street from any abutting residential lot shall be prohibited by deed restrictions, as recorded on the final plat. Driveway access onto a major street from any abutting nonresidential lot shall be prohibited by deed restriction, as recorded on the final plat, except as permitted via a central access driveway; provided, that: 
i.  All lots to use such a driveway shall have access easements at least twenty-five (25) feet wide recorded along the frontage of such lots. 
ii.  There is no discontinuous change in elevation at the boundary line of any of the lots along such access easement without the village engineer's approval of the grading elevations along the access easement. 
iii.  The plan commission shall recommend, and the village board shall require, additional area for turning radii, curb cuts, deceleration lanes, and snow deposit, if it is determined such are needed. 
5.  Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentrations of storm drainage waters onto adjacent lots. All drainage courses shall be in a drainage easement with protective language and appropriate conditions preventing alterations, building upon, or obstructing of the drainage ways. 
6.  Driveway Location. 
a.  Driveways shall be located so that there is adequate clear sight distance onto the abutting road and they shall avoid locations along the inside curve or below the crown of a hilltop on collector and major streets. 
b.  The centerline of any driveway shall be offset a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from the right-of-way line of a major street and thirty-five (35) feet from all other rights-of-way. 
B.  Blocks. 
1.  Design. 
a.  The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following: 
i.  Provisions for adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of uses contemplated; 
ii.  Zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions; 
iii.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of the street traffic. 
b.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major street, railroads, watercourses, or the other property lines of the subdivision. 
c.  No blocks shall exceed one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet in length except where required by unusual topographic conditions, nor shall they be less than four hundred (400) feet in length, unless approved by the village board. 
2.  Easements in Blocks. Easements no less than ten (10) feet wide through blocks shall be required as designated by the village to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic. 
C.  Buildings. 
1.  Conformance with Existing Ordinances. All buildings shall be located on lots in conformance with Title 17, the building code, and other rules and regulations of the village, the county and the state. 
2.  Residential Buildings. The following design criteria shall be incorporated into the preliminary plat and plan and all other site plans for residential buildings:

b.  All dwelling units shall be within reasonable proximity to open space areas. 
c.  Each dwelling unit should have direct access to the pedestrian walkway system. 
d.  Placement of the garage should not be visually disruptive, yet be within close proximity to each dwelling unit for which it is intended. 
e.  Reasonable visual and acoustical privacy should be provided for each residential dwelling unit, especially at entrances, patios, and balconies, with no unrestricted views into the principal rooms by the occupants of another building. 
f.  The location of the proposed buildings and structures should not have a significant adverse impact on adjacent land uses. 
g.  Paved access should be available for fire, ambulance and police vehicles to within one hundred (100) feet of the principal entrances of buildings. Closer access, for infrequent use, may be across unpaved areas as approved by the village. 
h.  Streetlights, postal boxes, street identification signs, and other such street fixtures should be compatible in design with the architectural intent of the nearby buildings and shall match the engineering standards contained in Chapter 16.20 and Appendix B.

3.  No exposed parking area containing more than two parking spaces should be within eight feet of any principal residential building. 
4.  Large parking areas should contain maintainable planting strips, bays, berms, and islands to provide visual screening, but shall not obstruct adequate clear sight distance. 
5.  Storage areas for recreational vehicles should be provided, if they are allowed. 
(Ord. 99-O-29 § 1 (part): prior code § 22.402) 
(Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
16.12.040 - Pedestrian circulation system. 
    Subdivisions shall provide a pedestrian circulation system in its design to connect individual dwelling units with parking and garbage disposal areas, to connect neighboring dwelling units, and to connect groups of dwelling units with schools, parks, commercial facilities, and other community facilities. 
A.  Criteria for Type of Pedestrian Circulation System. 
1.  The plan commission shall recommend, and the village board shall approve, the type of pedestrian circulation system appropriate for the subdivision and for the village, which may require the physical separation of the pedestrian circulation system from the vehicular circulation system, depending upon: 
a.  The size of the subdivision; 
b.  The pathway system, if any, used on adjacent property; 
c.  The topography of the property; 
d.  The official map of the village; 
e.  The presence of any linear physical features on the site, such as utility rights-of-way, and other similar features; 
f.  The amount of unsubdivided property adjacent to the subject site; 
g.  The location of the schools, parks, and community focal points. 
B.  Design Layout. 
1.  The layout of the system shall have a reasonable relationship to connections with residential areas with schools, area-wide parks, commercial facilities, work areas, existing or potential public transportation points, and other community facilities in a convenient and logical fashion. 
2.  The circulation system shall improve or assure public access at locations offering unusual overlooks or other particularly interesting physical features. 
3.  Extensions into adjoining property should be provided. 
4.  Conflict points with vehicular traffic shall be minimized, and shall be located only where there is adequate sight distance, and grade separated and/or improved with appropriate safety devices, if necessary. 
5.  The circulation system shall be selected to have minimum practical change in grade throughout their length and shall follow the natural slope of the land, provided adequate and properly engineered drainage is accommodated. 
6.  The circulation system shall provide for rest areas such as benches. 
7.  The system is to be built to current village engineering standards as depicted in Chapter 16.20 and Appendix B. 
C.  Location. The circulation system shall be located within public rights-of-way, public easements, or common areas maintained by a homeowner's association, parks, or schools sites. 
(Ord. 99-O-29 § 1 (part): prior code § 22.403) 
(Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
16.12.050 - Streets. 
A.  General Standards. 
1.  The subdivision shall have adequate off-site access to it, in a sufficient capacity to handle all traffic which can be reasonably expected to be generated for the land uses to be located in the subdivision. 
2.  All streets in the subdivision shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed street system as established on the official plan and comprehensive plan of the village. 
3.  Major elements of the street system should be used to help define and buffer different land use areas, enhancing their identity and cohesiveness. 
4.  To the extent feasible, the lineal length of streets, the number of street intersections, and the paved area within intersections should be minimized. 
5.  Parking will be allowed only on the one side of the street that does not have the fire hydrants and mailboxes in its parkway. 
B.  Types and Specifications. 
1.  Types. The functional definitions of the street classification system for the village are: 
a.  Major Arterial. A major street is a highway artery intended to carry a large volume of high speed traffic to locations outside of the village limits. Such streets are not intended to provide access to any abutting property. Intersections with such streets shall be limited. 
b.  Minor Arterial. This street functions to conduct traffic between major arterials, residential neighborhoods, work areas, commercial concentrations and/or important activity centers. It is intended to bring traffic from collector streets to major arterials. This type of road is not intended to provide access to abutting single-family lots but can provide access via controlled access driveways to abutting multiple family projects, industrial plants and commercial property. Such roads should extend from one major arterial to another major arterial; however one end may terminate at a major traffic generator. 
c.  Collector. This street connects local streets with streets of higher classifications. It is the principal street to bring traffic through a residential subdivision or a unified industrial, commercial or office project. Access to abutting, property can be permitted, but is not encouraged. Such streets should extend from an arterial or collector street to another arterial or collector street. Collector streets are characterized by a relatively even distribution of access and mobility functions. 
d.  Local Street. This street is the primary means of access to property. In residential areas, local streets should intersect with collector streets, not with arterials. Local streets are characterized by the many points of direct access to adjacent properties and the relatively minor value in accommodation mobility. 
e.  Cul-de-sacs. This is a short street ending in a turnaround design and intended as a permanent terminus. Such streets should be used to discourage through-traffic and to increase privacy. Cul-de-sacs in residential areas should be no longer than five hundred (500) feet as measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the radius point of the cul-de-sac unless otherwise approved by the village board. Landscaped islands will be allowed in the "bulb" of the cul-de-sac with village board approval. Landscaping must be approved by the village board. Cul-de-sacs shall be tear drop shaped in accordance with village design standards. The diameter of these landscaped islands shall be no more than forty (40) feet and no utility structures will be allowed in the islands. Cul-de-sac clear zones are to be provided as defined in the current village standards. 
f.  Private streets are prohibited. 
2.  Specifications. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation, and road-maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and to avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for streets are required: 
Street Right-of-Way Pavement Width 1 Radius of Horizontal Curves of Centerline Minimum/ Maximum Gradient Radius of Curb Returns at Intersections 6 Minimum Sight Clear Distance 3 Minimum Length of Vertical Curves 5 Tangent Between Horizontal Curves Major

Comm. 80/80 36/54 300 ft. 0.5% / 2% 45 500 ft. 200 ft. 200 ft.  
Notes: To minimum standards for street design. 
1. Pavement width is measured as back of curb to back of curb. 
2. The first dimension of the right-of-way and pavement width standards refers to the neck of the cul-de-sac; the second to the radius of the terminals or "bulb" of the cul-de-sac. 
3. Along horizontal and vertical curves. 
4. Another government body may set higher standards for right-of-way and pavement widths. 
5. Vertical curves shall not be used in sags and crests where the algebraic difference in gradients is less than 1.20, except as may be otherwise required by the engineer. 
6. The radius of curb returns at intersections in business areas may be reduced to thirty-five (35) feet, as recommended by the village engineer and approved by the village board. Under unusual topographic or site conditions, a longer radius may be required. 
C.  Design Layout. 
1.  General Concepts. 
a.  All streets shall be laid out in conformance with the official map and the comprehensive plan of the village unless other conditions make compliance with the official plan or comprehensive plan impracticable. Where streets are not shown on the official plan and comprehensive plan, the arrangement of streets within a subdivision shall either: 
i.  Provide for the continuation or protection of existing major arterial and minor arterial streets in adjacent areas unless other conditions make continuation impracticable; or 
ii.  Conform to a plan for the area or neighborhood recommended by the plan commission and approved by the village board to meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions make continuance of existing streets or conformance with the official plan or comprehensive plan impracticable. 
b.  All streets shall be located in relation to existing topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to efficient drainage and utility systems. 
c.  All streets shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
2.  Residential Streets. 
a.  A residential area should be conveniently accessible from major arterials. 
b.  Residential streets shall provide safe and convenient access to housing. 
c.  Local streets shall be laid out as to discourage high speed or through traffic, but the design shall be logical and comprehensible to a motorist or a pedestrian attempting to travel to and through the subdivision. 
d.  Curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shape streets shall be used where their use will result in a more desirable layout, or will avoid monotony of lot appearance. 
e.  Layouts of residential areas should be planned so that no future need to widen any local street or collector street will arise. 
f.  Local streets and cul-de-sacs shall intersect only with collector and minor arterials, unless the physical features of the site do not allow for such a design. 
3.  Nonresidential Streets. 
a.  Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended through adjacent existing or potential residential areas. 
b.  The streets and other access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrians. 
c.  Streets extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad right-of-way should: 
i.  Be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites; and 
ii.  Be at a distance of at least one hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad right-of-way when intersecting a street, which crosses the railroad at grade, or be at such other distance as shall be necessary, when intersecting a street, which will be grade separated when crossing the railroad. 
4.  Half Streets. Half streets shall not be permitted except to complete an existing half street which was dedicated and accepted, or to conform to the official plan and comprehensive plan of the village. 
5.  Other Design Criteria. 
a.  Tangents shall be used between reverse curves on all major arterials and minor arterials. 
b.  Vertical alignment of streets should assure that inclines generally can be negotiated during adverse weather conditions and that sight distances are adequate for safety. 
c.  Extension of roads shall be provided into all adjacent property as needed with appropriate temporary turn-around. When no such extension is provided, the extensions of appropriate easements to the boundary of the subdivision for pedestrian traffic, drainage facilities and utility lines shall be required. 
d.  Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the official plan or comprehensive plan indicates that a road should be realigned or widened which would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, such land shall be reserved and dedicated. 
e.  Traffic calming measures, when required by the village board, shall be designed to provide safe speed reduction of motor vehicle in accordance with recognized design standards. Features could include, but may not be limited to the following: 
1)  Landscape medians: minimum fifty (50) feet long by six feet wide, to include pedestrian islands within the island as necessary. Minimum pavement widths for traffic lanes outside the medians shall be twelve (12) feet (end of pavement to end of pavement) with barrier median curb. 
2)  Traffic circles, curb radius reductions, chokers or other traffic calming techniques as recommended by AASHTO and APWA. 
D.  Access. All lots shall have access onto a dedicated street. 
1.  Residential Access. 
a.  Residential areas of twelve (12) dwelling units to the acre or less shall have driveway access onto only cul-de-sacs, local streets, and collector streets. 
b.  Residential areas of more than twelve (12) dwelling units to the acre shall have driveway access only onto local, collector and minor arterials. 
2.  Access to Major Arterials. Where subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed major arterial, access to such major arterial shall be limited to one of the following: 
a.  The lots shall be so laid out that they back onto the major arterial and shall front onto a street of lower classification; provided, that no access shall be allowed onto the major arterial from the abutting lots, as recorded on the final plat, and provided further that a landscape strip at least twenty (20) feet wide shall be provided along the lot line abutting the major arterials. 
b.  A private central access driveway shall: 
i.  Be allowed only as specifically approved by the village board, upon recommendation of the plan commission; 
ii.  Be no closer than four hundred (400) feet to any street or any other central access driveway on the same side of a major street; 
iii.  Align with any street or central access driveway on the major street, or be offset therefrom by a minimum of two hundred (200) feet; 
iv.  Have an access easement recorded along the frontage of the lots to use same. Said easement shall also define maintenance responsibilities. 
E.  Alleys. 
1.  Public alleys in residential areas are generally not permitted with the exception below. 
2.  In commercial, business or industrial districts, provisions shall be made for service access, such as for off-street loading, unloading and parking, consistent and adequate for the use proposed. If, in the opinion of the village, such facilities are inadequate, the village may permit or require the dedication and improvement of a public alley, subject to the following criteria: 
a.  Alley intersection and shape changes in alley alignment shall be avoided. 
b.  The minimum width of any alley shall be twenty-four (24) feet. 
c.  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-end. 
F.  Intersections. 
1.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, but in no case shall any intersection be less than seventy-five (75) degrees. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom. 
2.  Intersections on the inside of a curve, on a hilltop, or at a point slightly below a hilltop shall be avoided, when possible. The centerline profile shall not exceed a maximum three percent for one hundred (100) feet adjacent to Tee or 4-way intersection with STOP control at crest or sag intersections. 
3.  An intersection of more than two streets shall not be permitted unless necessary to accommodate existing streets. 
4.  Centerlines of local streets at intersections should align or be offset by a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet. Local streets shall not necessarily continue across major arterial or minor arterials; but if the centerlines of such local streets approach the major arterial or minor arterial from opposite sides within two hundred fifty (250) feet of each other, measured along the centerline of the arterial or minor arterial, then the location shall be adjusted such that the adjoinment across the major arterial or minor arterial is continuous, and a jog is avoided. 
5.  In nonresidential areas and along major arterials, proposed new intersections shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any intersections on the opposite side of such street. 
6.  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the subdivider shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the village board to provide an adequate sight distance. 
7.  The cross slopes on street and intersection rights-of-way shall be three percent or less. 
8.  Intersections along major arterials shall be held to a minimum. The distance between such intersections shall not be less than twelve hundred (1,200) feet. On major arterials, collector streets, or local streets where traffic volume and safety considerations warrant, or where required by other governmental authority having jurisdiction, paved acceleration, deceleration, passing and turning lanes shall be provided, designed in accordance with the IDOT Bureau of Local Roads Manual. 
G.  Other Requirements. 
1.  Reserve Strips. Reserve strips (also known as "spite" or "devil" strips) controlling access to streets shall not be permitted. Streets roughly parallel to the boundary line of the subdivision shall be located either on the boundary line or not less than one lot depth from the boundary line. All streets intended to provide the subdivision and adjacent parcels of property with means of ingress and egress shall extend to the boundary line of the subdivision. 
2.  Road Names. The plan commission shall review and the village board shall approve all street names, consulting with the postmaster and the chief of the fire district. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the village so as not to cause confusion. A street which is or is planned as a continuation of an existing street, shall bear the same name.

(Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
16.12.060 - Easement. 
A.  Utility Easements. Easements for utility services shall be provided, totaling not less than ten (10) feet in width, or greater as required by the utility companies, the village, or the state. They shall be centered along the rear of each lot and along side lot lines where necessary, to provide for proper continuity of utility lines from lot to lot and from block to block. 
B.  Drainage Easements. Easement lakes, streams, and channels shall be protected by drainage easements. The location, width, alignment and improvement of these easements shall be approved by the village board, but in no case shall the easements be less than twenty (20) feet wide on each side of the watercourse at the high water mark. The easements shall permit necessary public channel maintenance and improvement work and access for equipment thereon. Easements shall appear on the final plat. Drainage easements may also be required to be placed in lot rear and/or side yards to allow overflow or through drainage patterns dictated by the stormwater management plan. Said easements may not be altered or blocked by berming, raised landscaping, or other manmade objects such as sheds or solid fences. 
C.  Other Requirements. 
1.  No building, shed or other permanent structure shall be constructed on any easement. 
2.  Extensions of utility easements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision may be required to provide continuity of the utilities to adjoining property. 
D.  Landscape Easements. Provide in accordance with Section 16.12.030 A.3.f. 
(Ord. 99-O-29 § 1 (part): prior code § 22.405) 
(Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
16.12.070 - Drainage ways. 
A.  Streams and Channels. Sharply meandering streams may be partly straightened and minor changes may be made in other channels subject to state statute; provided, that: 
1.  The floodway dimensions of the stream or channel are maintained; 
2.  The volume of floodwater storage outside of the floodway is not reduced; 
3.  No adverse impacts are created downstream; 
4.  Approval is obtained from the Army Corps of Engineers and any other applicable county, state and/or federal agency. 
B.  Lesser Channels. Lesser floodwater run-off channels on a parcel shall be maintained. They may be centered on the rear lot lines in a block or entirely within the rear yards of a single row of lots, provided in either case the lot depth is sufficient to provide a flow line slope of not less than one and one-half percent and side slopes of six horizontal to one vertical or less. The goal is to provide a building site above the established flood-protection elevation on the lot. Comply with the overland flow path performance standards of the Lake County Watershed Development Ordinance. 
C.  Uppermost Reaches and Lesser Channels. The uppermost reaches of drainage channels and swales forming the natural drainage system near the watershed divide may be relocated or eliminated and incorporated into the planning system of storm sewers and/or open channels upon a showing that the system is adequate, and can safety handle floodwater run-off. 
(Ord. 99-O-29 § 1 (part): prior code § 22.406) 
(Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
16.12.080 - Anti-monotony construction standards. 
A.  Definitions. The words contained in this section shall have the common meaning ascribed to them or such meanings as are contained within other sections of this code; provided, however, that the following words shall be interpreted to mean as follows: 
1.  "Adjacent lots" are lots that adjoin or share side property lines or lots on which, although separated by a street, front property lines overlap another by more than thirty (30) percent. 
2.  "Streetscape" means the facades of single-family dwellings on both sides of a street. The length of a streetscape shall be limited to no more than twenty (20) lots per side of street. When more than twenty (20) lots per street side exist without an intervening cross street, the village shall, through one of its officers or employees, establish those lots that shall constitute a separate streetscape. In making that determination, the official shall consider that configuration of lots that shall be most influenced and affected by adjacent lots. When possible, physical demarcations such as topography, road configuration, or landscaping shall be utilized in establishing the appropriate streetscapes. In general, the front orientation of the residence will determine the applicable streetscape. 
B.  Anti-Monotony Construction Standards for One-Family Dwelling Units. No two single-family dwellings of similar front elevation or facade shall be constructed or located on adjacent lots; nor shall there be constructed or located single-family dwellings of similar front elevation or facade constituting more than twenty (20) percent of the single-family dwellings in any streetscape. Front elevations or facades shall be deemed to be similar when there is no substantial difference in rooflines; and no substantial change in windows of either size, location or type; and either no change in the color of materials used (rather than a change in shade), or no substantial change in the kind of materials. 
1.  Rooflines. 
a.  For the purposes of this section, the following differences in the rooflines of single-family dwellings as seen from the front of the dwelling shall be deemed sufficient to render buildings containing such changes and built on adjacent lots to be dissimilar; 
i.  Changing gable roofs to hip roofs; 
ii.  Changing hip roofs to gable roofs;

(Ord. No. 12-O-25, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
16.16.100 - Dedication of park lands and school sites or for payment of fees in lieu thereof. 
    As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit development, land for park and recreational purposes and land for school sites, or cash contributions in lieu of land, or a combination of both, at the option of the village, shall be provided to serve these needs specifically and uniquely attributable to the residents of the subdivision or planned unit development. Planning studies indicate that the population growth in the village which accompanies new developments will accelerate in the coming years which will result in the rapid disappearance of available land and the marked increase in land values. The village has found that a healthful, productive community life depends in part on the quality of local schools and parks. The village has found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require the establishment of additional school and park sites and facilities serving the new residents of the village. 
    Demographic studies of the residential portions of a proposed subdivision or planned unit development can be readily and scientifically conducted to determine the number of elementary and secondary school-age children and adults to be generated therefrom and provide data by which the required dedications of land and capital costs specifically and uniquely attributable to the activity of the subdivider and the proposed subdivision or planned unit development may be calculated. 
    It has been found and determined by the village that the provision and location of school sites and buildings to serve the immediate and future needs of residents and children of each new residence, subdivision or planned unit development are just as essential to proper land development as are streets, water, sewers and sidewalks, and to that end the village has determined that the dedication of land for school sites or cash contributions in lieu of actual land dedication and the donation of capital costs shall be required of each subdivider of a single lot, subdivision or planned unit development. 
    The continued residential development presents local school districts with special challenges. Land for new school facilities may need to be acquired, new school facilities may need to be built and old school facilities may need to be renovated. Because new development will require the school districts to incur costs to make services available prior to the time that revenues are generated by new development, it is crucial that a means of addressing the impact of new development be provided so as to ensure that the present educational opportunities offered by the school districts can continue to be offered in the future. 
    This land or cash or combination thereof shall be provided in accordance with the following criteria and formula: 
A.  Criteria for Park and Recreational Land Requirements. 
1.  Land Requirement and Population Ratio. The amount of land required for dedication for park and recreational purposes shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of a proposed development. The total requirement shall be fifteen (15) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) persons of ultimate population computed in accordance with the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, which is attached to the ordinance codified in this title. 
2.  Location. The location and configuration of the site to be dedicated shall be determined by the village board upon recommendation of the plan commission and in consultation with the Round Lake Area park district, which shall take into account the comprehensive plan of the village, the suitability of the site for park purposes or development, its relationship to population concentrations and its proximity to other park or recreational lands. Donated land should be reasonably accessible and should be centrally located to all lots within the impacted area, where feasible. 
3.  Minimum Size, Topography, Soils, Improvements and Landscaping. 
a.  Minimum Size. The minimum size of land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be no less than one acre, one dimension of which cannot be less than one hundred (100) feet. However, the plan commission may recommend and the village board may approve, dedications of smaller sizes, when required by the specific plans of the development and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is demonstrated. 
b.  Topography and Soils. 
i.  The site must be graded to meet topography and to meet existing drainage patterns. 
ii.  At least eighty (80) percent of the donated land for park and recreational purposes shall be suitable in topography and soil types for recreational facilities. 
iii.  The soil shall allow construction of recreational facilities and have a soil bearing capacity to support recreational facilities. "Recreational facilities" are defined as: buildings and other physical features set aside in a park site that are used by participants of the community. Examples of recreational facilities include, but are not limited to, a swimming pool complex, playground picnic shelter, picnic sites, baseball/softball field, football/soccer field, various games activity courts, tennis court, basketball court, volleyball court, restroom/storage building, community center and waterfront area. 
c.  Improvements and Landscaping. 
i.  Each park site shall have sanitary and storm sewer, water, electricity, and gas available at the property lines of the dedicated site when these utilities are required in the subdivision. 
ii.  A designated paved parking area with curbing not to exceed nine spaces and one handicapped space for a total of ten (10) spaces, and located in close proximity to a dedicated street shall be provided in park sites over one acre. 
iii.  Landscaping. All seeding shall be of an acceptable stand of grass suitable for recreational uses to meet Round Lake Area park district specifications. A determination shall be made by the Round Lake Area park district on the type of seed to be planted and said determination shall be reached prior to final plat approval. A minimum of six trees per acre, at least four inches in caliper measured one foot from the ground, shall be planted. A determination by the Round Lake Area park district of tree numbers shall be made prior to final plat approval. Under no condition shall trees prohibited by Ordinance No. 06-O-11 be permitted. 
4.  Use of Wetlands and Detention Areas for Dedications and Environmental Quality. Wetlands and detention areas for storm water control shall not normally qualify as land for park and recreational purposes, but may be approved if an acceptable recreational use can be demonstrated or the area offers an exceptional amenity or the chance to protect a significant natural resource. 
    No site that has been part of an unlicensed landfill or a toxic waste dump shall be acceptable for park and recreational purposes. 
5.  Private Open Spaces and Recreational Areas. Land for park and recreational purposes shall not be privately owned and maintained unless specifically approved by the village board. The village board or staff shall approve the detailed plans for all improvements for such park and recreational land which is privately owned and maintained. Guarantees of the permanency of the use and maintenance of such privately owned and maintained park and recreational open space, satisfactory to the village staff, shall be entered into by the subdivider. The guarantees may include covenants and/or express provisions in the articles of condominium ownership or constitution and by-laws of a homeowner's association. 
B.  Criteria for Requiring a Contribution in Lieu of Park Sites. Where the development is small and the resulting land dedication is too small to be practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes, as determined by the village board, the subdivider shall pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land required. 
1.  Cash Contribution in Lieu of Park and Recreational Land Dedication. 
a.  The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreational land dedications shall be held in trust by the village, or another public body designated by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of park and recreational land. The cash contributions shall be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development. 
b.  Fair Market Value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as a park and recreational site. The fair market value, on a per acre basis, shall assume that the land is zoned residential, subdivided, stubbed with city sewer and water, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development. The fair market value, as defined above, shall be used in calculating any cash In lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in this title. Objections to the fair market value, as defined above, shall be made in accordance with of this title to the village board. Failure to timely object to the fair market value, as defined above, in accordance with of this title shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
2.  Refund of Cash Contributions. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of in park and recreational land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein twenty (20) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider who made such contributions. 
3.  Criteria for Requiring Dedication and Fee. A combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be required, when: 
a.  The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder. That portion of the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or sufficient for the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated; or 
b.  A major part of the local park or recreational site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision or development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. 
4.  Criteria for a Fully Developed Park. A fully developed park, including appropriate lighting, grading, landscaping, and recreational equipment, may be required when the availability of land for park land is limited and where the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision can be satisfied with a smaller but fully developed park with a more intensive activity level. 
C.  Criteria for Dedication of School Sites or Payment of Fees in Lieu Thereof. As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, a planned unit development or the issuance of a building permit, each subdivider shall be required to dedicate land for school purposes, make a cash contribution in lieu of a land dedication, or a combination of both. Whether a land donation, cash donation or combination of both is required shall be determined by the village with the concurrence of the affected school district. The donation shall be made in accordance with the following criteria: 
1.  Criteria for Requiring School Site Dedication. 
a.  Requirement and Population Ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly on the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The determination of the number of students to be generated from a particular development or lot shall be based on data published by the Illinois School Consulting Service, set out in Chapter 16.40 as Exhibit A. 
    A "bedroom," as used in this title, shall include any den, study, or extra room located on any floor in a dwelling unit which is not clearly identified for some other specific purpose, other than a kitchen (one per unit), dining room (one per unit), living room (one per unit), bathroom, and family room (one per unit). 
    In the event a subdivider files a written objection to Exhibit A, set out in Chapter 16.40, he or she shall submit his or her own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development. Exhibit A, set out in Chapter 16.40, shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein, unless objected to as provided in this title. Objections to said Exhibit A shall be made in accordance with this title to the village board. Failure to object to said Exhibit A in accordance with this title shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
b.  School Classification and Size of School Site. School classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the table attached as Exhibit B, set out in Chapter 16.40. These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and literature on the subject, including, but not limited to, information provided by the state superintendent of education and the unique characteristics of Lake County, including its generally rural character and its open spaces and the desire of its residents to maintain this character and open space in their future school sites. These requirements for acreage shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any contribution herein, unless timely objected to as provided herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in accordance with this title to the village board. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in accordance with of this title shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
c.  Land Dedication Requirement. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by multiplying the estimated children to be served in each such school classification calculated pursuant to Exhibit A, set out in Chapter 16.40, by the appropriate number of acres per student contained in Exhibit B, set out in Chapter 16.40. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increase in number of children in each such school classification. 
d.  Location. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
2.  Criteria for Requiring a Contribution in Lieu of School Sites. 
a.  Cash Contribution. When the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, the village, with the concurrence of the affected school district, shall require the subdivider to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication. These donations shall be made directly to the school districts and shall be used for the purpose of constructing school buildings and facilities necessary to educate the students generated by the development. 
b.  Fair Market Value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as a school site. The fair market value, on a per acre basis, shall assume that the land is zoned residential, subdivided, stubbed with city sewer and water, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development. Based upon a study of real estate transactions in Lake County for the past three years, it has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per acre. This figure shall be adjusted annually by the village board based on real estate transactions and any other indicators as to value. The fair market value, as defined above, shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in of this title. Objections to the fair market value, as defined above, shall be made in accordance with of this title to the village board. Failure to timely object to the fair market value, as defined above, in accordance with of this title shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
3.  Refund of Cash Contributions. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of school site dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein twenty (20) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider who made such contributions. 
D.  Donation of Capital Costs for the Building of School Facilities. In addition to a land dedication, or any donation of cash in lieu thereof, the village shall further require that as a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, a planned unit development, or issuance of a building permit in the case of single lots, that the subdivider, be required to make a donation to the school districts serving the development. These donations shall be made directly to the school districts and shall be used for the purpose of constructing school buildings and facilities necessary to educate the students generated by the development. 
1.  Calculation of Capital Costs. The most recent data available at the time of the passage of the ordinance codified in this title from the Illinois School Consulting Service estimates that one hundred (100) square feet is required for each elementary school student, one hundred fifty (150) square feet is required for each middle school student, and one hundred sixty (160) square feet is required for each high school student. Illinois School Consulting Service further estimates that it costs one hundred dollars ($100.00) per square foot to construct school facilities. A table setting forth the capital donation, as allocated to each specific type of dwelling unit is set out in Chapter 16.40, as Exhibit C. The amounts shown in Exhibit C shall be adjusted as deemed necessary by the village board based on reliable updated or additional information as to costs or square footage requirements. Any objection to the calculation of capital costs shall be made in accordance with this title to the village board. Failure to object pursuant to this title shall be a waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time. 
E.  Topography and Grading. The slope, topography and geology of any dedicated site, as well as its surroundings must be suitable for the building of school facilities. Wetlands, floodplains, floodways and land which serves as a component of any storm water control or retention system shall not be acceptable land donations. Land burdened by highway easements or any other type of easements or encroachment also shall not be an acceptable land donation. 
F.  Improved Sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer, and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter), as applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of the village's subdivision regulations. At the discretion of the village board, the landscaping normally included within the definition of improved sites under the village's subdivision regulations may be omitted due to the delay time between dedication of any such school site and the construction of school facilities thereon. 
G.  Objections. All objections relating to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair market value, the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, calculation of capital costs or any other application of this title to a particular lot, subdivision or planned development, shall be referred to the village board for hearing. An objection must be made, if at all, prior to the approval by the village of the final plat of subdivision or planned unit development. Where a plat of subdivision is not required, any objection must be made before the issuance of any building permit. A failure to object by such time shall constitute a waiver of the right to object to the provisions of this title. 
1.  Form of Objection. All objections shall be in writing and at a minimum contain the following information: 
a.  Specific identification of the exact data, calculation or other determination to which an objection is being made; 
b.  A detailed written basis for each and every objection made with specific reference to all data, written documentation and/or testimony on which each and every objection is based; 
c.  A specific detailed statement setting forth the proper data, calculation or determination which the objector believes should be made under this ordinance with specific and detailed reference to any data, documentary information and oral testimony supporting the position or belief; 
d.  Copies of all data, and/or any other documentary evidence upon which the objector intends to rely; 
e.  Where any data is submitted the objection shall make a specific reference as to the source of such data; 
f.  Where any studies performed by or on the behalf of the objector or any other source are submitted, the objector shall further submit detailed information concerning the methods and procedures used in the study to collect and analyze data; 
g.  Where any documentary or other evidence upon which the objector relies refers to other sources of information and/or back-up materials from which data or information was gathered, the objector shall provide copies of such back-up data and/or information; 
h.  A certification swearing that the objector has served if full and complete copies of its objection upon the superintendent and business manager for each elementary and high school district serving the village. If personal service is used the certification shall state: (1) the date upon which such personal service was made; (2) the home and business addresses of the individual making personal service; and (3) the identity and description of the individual to whom service was actually made. Where service is by certified mail return receipt requested the certification shall state the day and place on which such mailing was deposited with the U.S. post office and the name of the individual depositing same with the U.S. post office; 
i.  The legal and common description of the properties affected by the objection. 
2.  Waiver of Objections Not Made. All objections shall contain every and any objection being made. Any objections which are not specifically set forth shall forever be deemed waived. 
3.  Variances in the Form of the Objection. Where any objector believes the information required to be contained in the objection creates an undue hardship, the objector shall include with its objection a sworn certification stating specific and detailed reasons why all the information required cannot be supplied and all reasons why the objector believes that requiring this information is an undue hardship. 
4.  Procedure for Making an Objection. Eight copies of every objection shall be served upon the village administrator. If the objection is served on the village administrator ten (10) or more business days before the next regularly scheduled board meeting, the objection shall be formerly presented to the village board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If the objection is served upon the village administrator less than ten (10) business day before the boards next regularly scheduled meeting, the objection shall be formerly presented to the village board at the first regularly scheduled village board meeting which is ten (10) or more days after the date the objection is received by the village administrator. When the village administrator receives an objection he or she shall notify the objector and the superintendent and business manager of each elementary and high school district located within the village of the date at which the objection shall be formerly presented to the village board. The objector and/or the objector's representative shall appear at the date scheduled for the presentment of the objection to the village board. If service of the objection on the superintendents and business managers of each elementary and high school district located within the village was made by certified mail, the objector shall appear on the date and submit to the board proof that the objections were in fact received by the superintendents and business managers of each elementary and high school district located within the village. Any school district, through their representative, shall also have the right to appear and address the village board on the date the objection is formerly presented to the village board. On the date the objection is formerly presented the village board, the objectors and any representatives from the school shall set a date for a hearing on the objection. If requested, any school district shall be given at least thirty (30) calendar days to review and develop information to be presented at the hearing on the objection. If any school district believes additional time is necessary, the school district shall request same at the time the objection is formally presented to the board. The board shall give the school district more than thirty (30) days to develop information in preparation for the hearing if the school district can show good cause for such additional time. The factors to be considered in determining whether any school district has shown good cause include but are not limited to: (1) the length of the objection and the amount of supporting data contained in it; (2) whether all back-up data studies and reports have been submitted with the objection; (3) the school district's need to undertake additional study or gather additional information to present to the board at the hearing; and (4) the complexity of the issues involved. 
5.  Hearing. The hearing shall take place at a regular scheduled village board meeting or other special meeting duly noticed and called for this purpose. The hearing shall take place on the date and time set by the board. The village president shall preside over the hearing and render decisions on any testimonial and/or evidentiary questions that arise with the advice of the village attorney.

The objector and the school districts shall have the opportunity to cross examine each other's witnesses. Any member of the village board shall have the right to ask questions of any witness at any time. The objector and the school district shall be provided the opportunity to present rebuttal testimony and/or documentation. After the objector and the school district have submitted their testimony and documentation, the board shall give interested members of the public the right to be heard. The board shall have the right to continue the hearing from time-to-time on its own motion or on the request of the objector and/or any school district. The board shall deliberate in public and shall issue its written decision on each objection within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the hearing. The board may accept or reject the objector's position in whole or in part. 
6.  Notice of Hearing. At least once, not more than twenty (20) nor less than fifteen (15) calendar days before the hearing shall the objector publish in one or more newspapers published in the village, a notice setting forth the date, time and place for the scheduled hearing on the objection. The notice shall identify the nature of the objector's objection, the relief requested, identify the property or properties involved by both legal and common descriptions and invite any interested members of the public to attend. At the opening of the scheduled hearing the objector shall initially furnish to the board proof that it has complied with the requirements of this subsection. 
7.  Annexation. The dedication of land, cash contribution in lieu thereof and donation of capital costs required by this title of a platted subdivision shall also be required as a condition of the annexation of any land to the village, and shall be incorporated in any pre-annexation or annexation agreement governing such land. However, the village reserves the right to negotiate dedications of land or cash in lieu of land and donations for capital costs which are greater than those set forth herein. 
8.  Indemnification. As a precondition to the school district's collection of school site dedications, cash in lieu of land donations and capital costs donations, the school district shall execute an agreement indemnifying the village and holding it harmless from any damages and costs which arise out of any challenge to the validity of this title. 
9.  Schedule of Donations. The cash in lieu of land contribution and capital cost donation imposed by this title shall be made by a certified or cashier's check payable directly to the applicable school district and held by the school district. 
    Fifty (50) percent of any projected cash in lieu of land donation and capital cost donations imposed by this title shall be due and payable for each unit to be built prior to final plat approval of the subdivision or final approval of a planned unit development. Prior to the issuance of a building permit for each unit to be built, the balance of all cash in lieu of land donations and the balance of all capital cost donations relating to that unit shall be due and payable. 
    In calculating the total amount of any cash in lieu of land contribution imposed by this title, the village shall use the fair market value of property in effect at the time of building permit issuance. In calculating the total capital cost contribution imposed by this title, the village shall use the capital costs in effect at the time of building permit issuance. 
    For cash in lieu of land donations and capital cost donations due and payable prior to final plat approval of a subdivision or final approval of a planned unit development, the school district shall issue a receipt showing: (1) total projected cash in lieu of land donation; (2) the total projected capital cost donation; and (3) the amount of the projected cash in lieu of land donation and capital cost donation actually paid. For cash in lieu of land donations and capital cost donations payable prior to the issuance of any building permit, the school district shall issue a receipt for each lot or unit which shows that payment of the full cash in lieu of land donation and/or capital cost donation has been received. Each such receipt issued for donations received prior to the issuance of building permits shall identify the name of the builder/developer requesting the permit and specifically designate the subdivision and lot or unit to which the donation is referred. 
    At the time the first donation is made, subdivider shall provide to the school district a copy of the approved plat of subdivision or other document showing all lots which are proposed to be developed. In the event any amendments or changes are made to the approved plat of subdivision, the subdivider shall submit a revised plat of subdivision identifying all lots and showing all changes or revisions which have been made. The school district shall use the plats of subdivision provided to mark off those lots for which the full cash donation has been paid. 
10.  Severability. If any provision of this title or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such partial invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or applications of this title, the invalid provision shall be deemed stricken from this title as if it were not a part hereof, ab initio, and the remainder of this title shall continue in full force and effect. 
H.  General Provisions. 
1.  Reservation of Additional Land. Where the comprehensive plan or standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular subdivision or development than the subdivider is required by this title to dedicate, the land needed in excess of the required dedication shall be reserved by the subdivider for subsequent acquisition by the village or other public body designated by the village; provided, that such acquisition is started within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
2.  Combining With Adjoining Developments. Park or recreational land dedications and school site dedications may be combined with dedications from adjoining subdivisions and developments in order to produce usable recreational areas or school sites without hardship on a particular subdivider. 
3.  Improved Sites. All sites shall have a portion of their frontage improved with water and sanitary utility lines, electrical service, and fully improved streets. 
4.  Dedication at Time of Approval of Final Plat. Approval of any final plat of subdivision or any final planned unit development plat shall be conditioned upon the dedication of land or cash donations in lieu thereof as required by this title. Dedications of such land or cash in lieu thereof may be made at such other time as is specifically approved by the village board. 
5.  On-Site Storage. No storage of any equipment and/or material, including spoil materials or top soil, shall be permitted on any land designated for park and recreational use or for school sites. 
J.  Donations Required From Properties Outside Village Corporate Limits. In the event that land which is subject to subdivision or planned unit development approval by the village is not within the corporate limits of the village at the time of approval of a final plat of subdivision or planned unit development for the land, the provisions of this section shall not apply to the land with respect to contributions for village library services or in any other instance where the land is not within the jurisdiction of the governmental entity to which the contribution or donation is to be made. 
    However, in the event that land which is subject to subdivision approval by the village is not within the corporate limits of the village at the time of approval of a final plat of subdivision or planned unit development for the land, the governing body of any governmental entity which would be entitled to land and/or cash donations pursuant to this section, may request that the village vary the terms of this section by allowing the governmental entity to make its own agreement and/or waiver as to any or all of the donations and amounts thereof required in this section with the subdivider of the land. The request shall be made in writing by a resolution adopted by the governing board of the governmental entity. In such an event, the village may, by motion, condition subdivision approval upon compliance with the provisions of this section as the provisions of this title have been modified by the variation and/or waiver.

Upon proof of difficulty, the village board may grant an extension of the completion date for a maximum period of one year. 
d.  Any bond proposed to be posted as security shall be required to have approval of the village board, and shall also have a rating of at least A- as rated by the A. M. Best rating service. 
4.  The amount of the letter of credit, cash, or other securities may be reduced upon successful completion of the improvements. The village engineer must inspect the public improvements and recommend any reduction to be approved by the village board. In the case of a nature conservancy or natural area being constructed as identified in Section 16.16.120.A.3.a, the bond may be reduced by one-third of the total value each year, subject to inspection by the village staff certifying successful establishment. 
5.  Letter of Credit/Securities. 
a.  A letter of credit may be reduced, and cash and other securities released in part, upon completion of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the completed public improvement bears to the total improvements required. In no event shall the amount of a letter of credit or cash and other securities be reduced to an amount below twenty-five (25) percent of the initial principal amount of the letter of credit, unless approved by the village board. 
b.  Prior to the village authorizing any construction guarantee reduction, the developer shall submit to the village a request for said reduction, along with a certification from the developer and his project engineer that the public improvements included in the construction guarantee have been constructed in substantial compliance with the village-approved improvement plans and specifications. Village staff will then review said request, and forward his recommendation to the village board who shall retain the authority to grant, adjust, or reject the requested reduction. 
B.  Inspection of Improvements and Preparation of "As-Built" Plans. 
1.  Inspection by Village Engineer. The village engineer shall inspect all required improvements during construction in conformance with Section 16.24.030 to ensure that they are installed in conformance with the regulations contained in this chapter and the approved final engineering drawings. The subdivider shall pay all such inspection fees and charges as established by ordinance. Before any work in the subdivision is started an escrow deposit in an amount determined by the village shall be made with the village for those payments, consistent with Section 3.04.020 of the Village Code. 
2.  Corrections at Subdivider's Expense. If the village staff finds, upon inspection, that any of the required improvements have not been constructed and installed in accordance with the standards, specifications and ordinances of the village and in conformance with the approved final engineering drawings, the subdivider shall be responsible for completing and correcting the required improvements before the same shall be accepted by the village. The corrections and/or completions must be performed within thirty (30) days of the date of inspection. This date can be extended upon approval by the village staff. 
3.  Preparation of "As-Built" Plans. "As-built" plans showing the location, size and invert elevations of all valves, manholes, stubs, sewer and water mains, all service locations, all b-boxes, the sump pump collection system and cleanouts, detention basins, and other improvements shall be prepared at the end of construction and submitted to the village staff for review. The information necessary for the As-Built detention basin includes a sealed statement by the licensed professional design engineer indicating that the as-built volume at the basin has been verified, the actual High Water Level (HWL) shall be verified against the design calculations, the actual Normal Water Elevation (NWL) shall be verified against the design calculations, the emergency overflow elevation and outlet shall be verified to comply with the proposed design calculations, and the two-year and one-hundred-year restrictors shall be installed in place and verified on the as-builts as the as-built elevations. An intermediate as-built submittal is required to verify the invert of any sewer pipes (storm or sanitary) that lie under any roadway pavement before the base material for said pavement is placed. Village staff will review the "as-built" plans and compare them with the approved final engineering drawings. In addition, the village will conduct any field inspections necessary to ensure the validity of the "as-built" plans. If in the opinion of the village engineer there are unacceptable differences in the two drawings, the subdivider shall correct those differences. The approval of these "as-built" plans will occur before acceptance of the improvements and release of any letter of credit, cash, or other securities. The approved set of as-built plans, a reproducible copy, and a version in an electronic format approved by the village will become the property of the village. 
4.  Public Improvement GPS locating and updating of the village GIS Maps. In addition to furnishing the public improvement as-built data, the developer shall be responsible for performing or for reimbursing the village to have all installed structures located spatially by high-resolution global positioning system or other applicable means. That data will then be transferred to the village geographic information system (GIS) that catalogues and archives the public improvements. Updating of the GIS database by the village shall also be reimbursed by the developer by means of the escrow account. 
C.  Dedication and Acceptance of Improvements. 
1.  Dedication of Improvements.

b.  The street and its appurtenances must be completed upon eighty (80) percent of the total units being occupied in a subdivision with the approval of the village engineer. 
c.  Title to the improvements required to be dedicated to the village shall be transferred by bill of sale, with proof of ownership in the grantor and evidence that the improvements are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances, and shall be in a form acceptable to the village, and shall also include lien waivers from all subcontractors and materialmen. 
d.  Any improvements to be dedicated to the homeowner's association (HOA), of which the developer is not a member, cannot be dedicated without the HOA being notified in writing of acceptance of subdivision and the HOA's responsibility. 
D.  Maintenance of Improvements. 
1.  Maintenance of Nonaccepted Improvements at Subdivider's Expense. The subdivider shall maintain and repair all required improvements including snow and ice removal on streets and sidewalks, if necessary, until acceptance of the improvements by the village board. If any necessary maintenance and repairs are not made to the required improvements in a timely fashion by the subdivider, the village may on twenty-four (24) hours notice to the subdivider, effect such repairs or maintenance, and shall charge the costs of same to the subdivider. 
    The subdivider shall maintain the streets and roadways in a safe passable condition. The village may effect any ice or snow removal in less than the twenty-four (24) hours if, in the opinion of the director of public works, the streets are unsafe for emergency vehicles. The cost of same shall be charged to the subdivider. 
    Any such repair or maintenance costs or snow and ice removal costs may be charged to the subdivider's letter of credit, cash or other security. 
2.  Filing of Maintenance Retention or Guarantee.

D.  To facilitate the provision of adequate transportation, and of other public requirements and service such as water, sewage, schools and parks; 
E.  To conserve the value of property throughout the village and to protect the character and stability of residential, business and industrial areas; 
F.  To provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses of land, buildings and structures which would adversely affect the character and value of structures and neighborhoods; 
G.  To divide the village into districts of such number, shape, area, and of such different classes, according to the use of land, buildings, the height, and bulk of buildings, the intensity of use, and the area of open spaces and recreational spaces, as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purposes of this title; 
H.  To lessen or avoid the hazard to persons and damage to property resulting from the accumulation of run-off or storm or flood waters; 
I.  To preserve and insure the preservation of natural resources; 
J.  To preserve and insure the preservation of acres of historical and architectural significance; 
K.  To prevent the overcrowding of land and undue concentration of structure, so far as is possible and appropriate in each district, by regulating the use and bulk of buildings in relation to the land surrounding them; 
L.  To conserve the taxable value of land and buildings throughout the village; 
M.  To avoid the inappropriate development of lands and provide for adequate drainage, curbing of erosion, and reduction of flood damage; 
N.  To fix reasonable standards to which buildings and structures shall conform; 
O.  To prevent such additions to, and alterations or remodeling of, existing buildings or structures as would not comply with the restrictions and limitations imposed in this title; 
P.  To foster a more rational pattern of relationship between residential, business, commercial and manufacturing uses for the mutual benefit of all; 
Q.  To isolate or control the location of unavoidable nuisance producing uses, and to protect against fire, explosion, noxious fumes, and other dangers; 
R.  To define the powers and duties of the administrative and enforcement officers and bodies; 
S.  To prescribe penalties for any violation of the provisions of this title, or of any amendment thereto. 
    The standards and requirements contained in this title, and the district mapping reflected on the Round Lake zoning district map, are intended to implement the objectives of the comprehensive plan for the village.

    It is the purpose of the R-3 zoning district to accommodate suburban-style single-family developments as envisioned in the Round Lake 1990 Interim Land Use Plan. Since adopting the interim plan, a number of R-3 and R-3 planned unit developments have been approved which, when combined with the number of existing lots and developments in the R-4, R-10 and other planned developments, results in satisfying the village's need for R-3 lots configured to the minimum requirements of the district, as set forth in the interim plan. The R-3 district is retained to accommodate development in existing R-3 areas and is not to be applied to additional areas of the village.

Chapter 17.32 - R-4 GENERAL RESIDENCE DISTRICT 
Sections: 

17.32.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this R-4 zoning district is to accommodate development of one particular area of the community that was historically platted with long narrow lots, generally sixty (60) feet wide by two hundred (200) feet deep. The bulk and area standards incorporated into this R-4 district reflect the pattern of development historically established in the area. The comprehensive plan for the village does not anticipate the establishment of new areas in the village and its environs with these exceptionally long, narrow lots and these older bulk standards. For these reasons the R-4 district is limited to the area bounded generally by Forest Avenue, Cedar Lake, Route 134 and Orchard Avenue, and cannot be expanded beyond these limits, and no new R-4 District areas can be established outside of these borders.

Chapter 17.44 - R-10 OLD TOWN SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT 
Sections: 

17.44.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter of the R-10 zoning district is to accommodate development of one particular area of the community that was historically platted with small lots, generally forty (40) feet wide by one hundred twenty (120) feet deep. The bulk and area standards incorporated into this R-10 district reflect the pattern of development historically established in the area. The comprehensive plan for the village does not anticipate development of new areas in the village and its environs with these exceptionally small and narrow lots and these older bulk standards. For these reasons the R-10 district is limited to the area bounded generally by the north and east village corporate limits north of Route 134, Cedar Lake Road, and the ease line of Magee Middle School and Round Lake Senior High School property, and cannot be expanded beyond these limits. No new R-10 districts can be established outside of the borders.

The purpose of the performance standards procedure is to ensure that an objective, unbiased determination is made in those cases where there may be substantial doubt as to whether an individual land use or group of land uses comply with the performance standards of this section, and to formulate practical ways for the alleviation of such noncompliance. 
B.  Compliance. Should the zoning administrator determine that the proposed use may violate the performance standard set forth herein, the zoning administrator shall require information from the applicant or owner or operator and initiate an investigation. Should such additional data be required, the zoning administrator shall request information including but not limited to the following: 
1.  Plans of the existing or proposed construction and development; 
2.  A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes and products; 
3.  Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to be used in restricting the possible emission of any of the dangerous and objectionable elements as set forth in this section; 
4.  Measurements of the amount or rate of emission of the dangerous and objectionable elements. Failure to submit data requested by the zoning administrator shall constitute grounds for denying a permit. 
C.  Report by Expert Consultants. The zoning administrator may require any person, firm or corporation to retain an expert consultant or consultant to study and report as to compliance or noncompliance with the performance standards, and to advise how a proposed use can be brought into compliance with the performance standards. Such consultants shall be persons or firms mutually agreeable to the zoning administrator and to the owner or operator of the use in question. In the event of inability to select a mutually agreeable consultant, the zoning board of appeals shall select the consultant. The cost of the consultants' services shall be borne by the owner or operator of the use. 
D.  Action by the Zoning Administrator. Within sixty (60) days following the receipt of the acquired evidence, or receipt of the reports of expert consultants, the zoning administrator shall make a determination as to compliance or noncompliance with the performance standards. The zoning administrator may require modification or alternations in the existing or proposed construction or the operational procedures to ensure that compliance with the performance standards will be maintained. The operator shall be given a reasonable length of time to effect any changes prescribed by the zoning administrator for the purpose of securing compliance with the performance standards. 
E.  Enforcement. The zoning administrator shall investigate any purported violation of performance standards, and, if there are reasonable around for the same, shall investigate the alleged violation. For such investigation, the administrator may employ qualified experts. If, after public hearing on due notice, the village finds that a violation occurred or exists, a copy of said findings shall be forwarded to the owner or operator with instructions to correct the violation. 
    The service of any qualified experts, employed by the village to advise in establishing a violation, shall be paid by the violator if the violation is established by the village. 
F.  Cancellation of Permits. If, after the conclusion of the time granted for compliance with the performance standards, the zoning administrator finds the violation is still in existence, any permits previously issued shall be void and the operator shall be required to cease operation until the violation is remedied. 
G.  Industrial Performance Standards. 
1.  Noise. For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequency of sound, the sound level meter, the octave band analyzer, and the impact noise analyzer shall be employed. The flat network and the fast meter response of the sound level meter shall be used. Sounds of short duration which cannot be measured accurately with the sound level meter shall be measured with the impact noise analyzer. Octave band analyzers calibrated in the preferred frequencies (American Standards Association SI 6-1950, Preferred Frequencies for Acoustical Measurements) shall be used with the following tables. 
    Exceptions: The following uses and activities shall be exempt from the noise level regulations in the I-1 district. 
a.  Noise not directly under control of the property user; 
b.  Noises emanating from construction and maintenance activities between seven a.m. and ten p.m. 
    Such activities are those which are nonroutine operations accessory to the primary activities and which are temporary in nature, or conducted infrequently. 
c.  The noises of safety signals, warning, devices, and emergency pressure relief valves; 
d.  Transient noises at moving sources such as automobiles, trucks, airplanes and railroads. 
    At no point along the boundary of a residential district or along as adjacent lot shall the sound pressure level of any operation or plant exceed the decibel limits in the octave bands designated below.

2.  Vibration. Any industrial operation or activity which shall cause at any time and at any point along the nearest adjacent lot line, earth borne vibrations in excess of the. limits set forth in Column I is prohibited. 
    In addition, any industrial operation or activity which shall cause at any time and at any point along resident district boundary line, earth borne vibrations in excess of the limits set forth in Column II is prohibited. 
    Exceptions: The following uses and activities shall be exempt from the vibration level regulations: 
a.  Vibrations not directly under the control of the property user; 
b.  Vibrations emanating from construction and maintenance activities between seven a.m. and nine p.m. Such activities are those which are nonroutine operations accessory to the primary activities and which are temporary in nature, or conducted infrequently; 
c.  Transient vibrations of moving sources such as automobiles, trucks, airplanes and railroads. 
    Vibrations shall be expressed as displacement in inches and shall be measured with a three component measuring system approved by the zoning administrator.

    "Steady state vibrations," for purposes of this chapter, are vibrations which are continuous, or vibrations in discrete impulses more frequent than one hundred (100) per minute. Discrete impulses which do not exceed one hundred (100) per minute, shall be considered impact vibrations and shall not cause in excess of twice the displacements stipulated. 
3.  Smoke and Particulate Matter. Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such sources as storage areas, yards, roads, and so forth within lot boundaries shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling, or other acceptable means. 
    For the purpose of grading the density equivalent opacity of smoke, the Ringelmann Chart, published by the United State Bureau of Mines, shall be employed. 
    The emission of more than twenty (20) smoke units per hour per stack is prohibited, including smoke of a density in excess of Ringelmann No. 2. However, once during any six-hour period each stack may emit up to thirty-five (35) smoke units, not to exceed Ringelmann No. 2, when blowing soot or cleaning fires. Only during fire cleaning periods, however, shall smoke of Ringelmann No. 3 be permitted, and then for not more than four minutes per period. 
    The rate of emission of particulate matter from all sources within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of one pound per acre of lot area during any one hour, after deducting from the gross hourly emission per acre the correction factor set forth in the following table: 
Allowance for Height of Emission* 
Height of Emission (Above Grade (Feet)) Correction (Pounds per Hour per Acre) 50 0.01 100 0.06 150 0.10 200 0.16 300 0.30 400 0.50  
* Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table. 
    Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows: 
a.  Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area, thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre. 
b.  From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in subdivision (3)(a) of this subsection, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of emission set forth in the table, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in 
pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission. 
c.  Add together the individual net rates of emission derided in subdivision (3)(b) of this subsection, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of emission within the boundaries of the lot. Such total shall not exceed one pound per acre of lot area during any one hour. 
4.  Toxic Matter. The measurement of toxic matter shall be made at ground level or habit table elevation and shall be the average of any twenty-four (24) hour sampling period. The release of any airborne toxic matter shall not exceed the fractional quantities permitted of those toxic matters currently listed in the Threshold Limit Values adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. If a toxic substance is not contained in this listing, the applicant shall satisfy the County that the proposed levels will be safe and not detrimental to the general population nor injurious to plant and animal life. 
    In the I-1 district, the release of airborne toxic matter shall not exceed one-thirtieth of the threshold limit values across lot lines. 
5.  Noxious and Odorous Matter. In the I-1 district, no activity or operation shall cause at any time the discharge of matter across lot lines in such concentration as to be noxious. The emission of matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable as an odor at any point along lot lines is prohibited.

    "Steady state vibrations," for purposes of this chapter, are vibrations which are continuous, or vibrations in discrete impulses more frequent than one hundred (100) per minute. Discrete impulses which do not exceed one hundred (100) per minute, shall be considered impact vibrations and shall not cause in excess of twice the displacements stipulated. 
3.  Smoke and Particulate Matter. Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such sources as storage areas, yards, roads, and so forth within lot boundaries shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling, or other acceptable means. 
    For the purpose of grading the density equivalent opacity of smoke, the Ringelmann Chart, published by the United State Bureau of Mines, shall be employed. 
    The emission of more than twenty (20) smoke units per hour per stack is prohibited, including smoke of a density in excess of Ringelmann No. 2. However, once during any six-hour period each stack may emit up to thirty-five (35) smoke units, not to exceed Ringelmann No. 2, when blowing soot or cleaning fires. Only during fire cleaning periods, however, shall smoke of Ringelmann No. 3 be permitted, and then for not more than four minutes per period. 
    The rate of emission of particulate matter from all sources within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of one pound per acre of lot area during any one hour, after deducting from the gross hourly emission per acre the correction factor set forth in the following table: 
Allowance for Height of Emission* 
Height of Emission (Above Grade (Feet)) Correction (Pounds per Hour per Acre) 50 0.0 100 0.5 150 0.8 200 1.2 300 2.0 400 4.0  
* Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table. 
    Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows: 
a.  Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area, thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre. 
b.  From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in subdivision (3)(a) of this subsection, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of emission set forth in the table, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission. 
c.  Add together the individual net rates of emission derided in subdivision (3)(b) of this subsection, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of emission within the boundaries of the lot. Such total shall not exceed one pound per acre of lot area during any one hour. 
4.  Toxic Matter. The measurement of toxic matter shall be made at ground level or habit table elevation and shall be the average of any twenty-four (24) hour sampling period. The release of any airborne toxic matter shall not exceed the fractional quantities permitted of those toxic matters currently listed in the Threshold Limit Values adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. If a toxic substance is not contained in this listing, the applicant shall satisfy the county that the proposed levels will be safe and not detrimental to the general population nor injurious to plant and animal life. 
    In the I-1 district, the release of airborne toxic matter shall not exceed one-thirtieth of the threshold limit values across lot lines. 
5.  Noxious and Odorous Matter. In the I-1 district, no activity or operation shall cause at any time the discharge of matter across lot lines in such concentration as to be noxious. The emission of matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable as an odor at any point along lot lines is prohibited. 
6.  Fire and Explosive Hazards. 
a.  Flammable Solids. The storage, utilization or manufacture of solid materials or products ranging from incombustible to moderate burning is permitted. 
    The storage, utilization or manufacture of solid materials or products ranging from free or active burning to intense burning is permitted provided the following condition is met: 
    The materials or products shall be utilized or manufactured within completely enclosed buildings having incombustible exterior walls and protected throughout by an automatic fore extinguishing system. 
b.  Flammable Liquids and Gases.

Every ordinance granting approval of a special use permit for a communication tower and support structures shall state that any of the rights thereunder may be made only with the approval of an ordinance or resolution by the board of trustees and subject to review by the board of trustees, at ten (10) year intervals to determine whether the technology in the provision of communication services has changed such that the necessity of the special use permit at the time of its approval has been eliminated or modified, and whether the special use permit should be modified or terminated as a result of such change. 
(Ord. 07-O-49 § 1 (part)) 
(Ord. No. 18-O-21, § 8, 5-21-2018) 
17.76.090 - Co-location and location on existing structures preferred. 
    In order to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers, co-location of antennas by more than one provider on existing or new towers and location of antennas on existing buildings or structures shall take precedence over the construction of new freestanding towers. If a new, freestanding tower is proposed, special use approval shall not be granted unless the applicant demonstrates compliance with the following: 
A.  A diligent effort has been made to locate the antenna on an existing structure and that due to valid considerations including physical constraints and economic or technological feasibility, no other appropriate location is available. 
B.  Covenants shall be recorded which require that the applicant allow, on a commercially reasonable basis, other providers of communication towers and other antennas to co-locate on the proposed freestanding tower, where such co-location is technologically feasible. 
C.  The site plan for the construction of a new, freestanding tower shall delineate an area, either on site or on adjacent property, near the base of the tower to be used for the placement of additional equipment and buildings for other users. To the extent that the site for the new freestanding tower is adequate to allow co-location on such site, the applicant must allow, on a commercially reasonable basis, other providers to locate on site. 
(Ord. 07-O-49 § 1 (part)) 
17.76.100 - Abandonment of towers or antennas. 
    In the event the use of a tower or antenna is discontinued for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days, the tower or antenna shall be deemed to be abandoned. The economic and community development director shall determine the date of abandonment based on documentation required from the tower owner/operator or other appropriate sources. 
A.  Reactivate the use of the tower either by said owner/operator or transfer of the tower to another owner/operator for such use within the aforesaid sixty (60) day period. Transfer of the tower to another owner/operator shall not require special use approval provided use of the tower is reactivated within the sixty (60) day period and that the use of the tower complies with all conditions of the original special use approval and the terms of this chapter. 
B.  Dismantle and remove the tower at which time any special use shall become null and void. 
C.  Any owner receiving a notice from the village pursuant to this subsection may appeal such determination of abandonment by filing a notice of appeal with the zoning board of appeals in accordance with this chapter and Section 11-13-12 of the Illinois Municipal Code 65 ILCS 5/11-13/12. The notice shall set forth all bases on which owner relies to assert that no such abandonment has occurred. 
D.  The request for approval will then be forwarded to the board of trustees to allow the abandoned tower or antenna to remain for a specified period of time. If said approval is granted, the tower shall be reactivated or removed within the time period as denoted in the findings by the board of trustees as per regulations herein.

Chapter 17.80 - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 
Sections: 
Article 1. - Planned Developments 

17.80.010 - Purpose. 
    This article is intended to provide the method by which tracts of land may be developed as a unit other than by a lot by lot basis as provided in this title. It is intended to provide a maximum of design freedom by permitting the developer an opportunity to more fully utilize the physical characteristics of the site through the reduction of lot sizes, yard, height and bulk restrictions and the planned mixing of uses. 
    Through the requirement of a development plan, it is the intention that property under this title will be developed through a unified design providing contiguity between the various elements causing a better environment. Increased residential densities may be permitted if such increases are the result of a design which does not result in the lessening of other ordinance requirements. 
    This article should not be used as a means of evading the development ordinances of the village and should only be employed in instances where there is derived, by its use, a benefit to the village. 
    This article will also establish standards and procedures for planned developments, in accordance with the following objectives: 
A.  Allow variety and flexibility in land development necessary to meet changes in technology and demand, consistent with the best interest of the village; 
B.  Allocate, maintain and preserve common open space, recreation areas and facilities; to offer neighborhood recreational opportunities; to enhance the appearance of neighborhood through the conservation of natural resources; 
C.  Provide a maximum choice in the types of environment available by permitting a development that would not be allowed by other methods; 
D.  Allow a pattern of development preserving natural vegetation, topographic and geologic features, air and water quality, and other natural resources; 
E.  Provide a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities that allows aesthetic development and design plan; 
F.  Provide an efficient use of land resulting in a more useful plan for utilities, streets, schools, public grounds, buildings and other public facilities; 
G.  Provide for land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort and welfare; 
H.  Permit innovations in residential, commercial and industrial construction so that the needs of the community may be met by allowing greater variety in type, design and planning. 
    The planned development is intended to provide for developments incorporating a single, or a multiple of related uses, planned and developed as a unit. Such development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots or a planned development in keeping with the purpose of the plan. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.11-1) 
(Ord. No. 12-O-24, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012)

(Ord. No. 12-O-24, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
17.80.030 - Pre-application procedures. 
    Prior to filing a formal application for approval, the petitioner shall request a pre-application conference with village staff. The request for a pre-application conference shall be submitted to the village. No such conference shall be binding upon the village. The purpose of the pre-application conference is to advise and assist the petitioner before presentation of the tentative development plan, so that the petitioner may determine: 
A.  Whether the proposed planned development appears in general, to be in compliance with the provisions of the zoning and other applicable ordinance; 
B.  Whether any zoning amendment or variance is required; 
C.  Whether the proposed planned development will be in conformity with the comprehensive development plan of the village. 
    The pre-application conference is mandatory, but does not require formal application, fee or filing of a planned development. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.11-3) 
(Ord. No. 12-O-24, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012; Ord. No. 19-O-07, § 2, 5-6-2019) 
17.80.040 - Tentative development plan. 
    This section provides the method by which the plan commission may determine if the proposed development complies with the purpose of this article. When a planned development is of fifty (50) acres or less, there shall be submitted both tentative and preliminary development plans prior to public hearing. When a planned development is in excess of fifty (50) acres, there may be submitted tentative, preliminary and final plans separately over the prescribed period of time. When a tentative development plan has been approved by the village board, the development plan may proceed to the final development review stage provided that the submission requirements for both the preliminary PUD (Section 17.80.100) and Final PUD (Section 17.80.160) are submitted to the village for review.

C.  Uses. The planned unit development may include any or all uses permitted within any of the existing zoning districts or a mixture thereof; provided, that the uses permitted in the planned development shall be of a type and location so that each, by itself would be allowed rezoning, taking into account the same principals taken into account in rezoning. In addition, all uses within the planned development shall be compatible each with the other. 
D.  Names and addresses of the persons to whom notices of hearings hereunder shall be sent including the petitioner, the designer of the subdivision and the owners of the land within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the planned development.

Residential planned development areas shall include recreational areas equivalent to at least thirty (30) percent of the total residential area, and industrial and commercial areas shall include permanent common open space in an amount equivalent to ten (10) percent of the total commercial and/or industrial areas of the planned development. 
B.  Designation. 
1.  The plan commission shall determine whether land is suitable for designation as recreational use and in so doing shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The relationship of the location of the land being considered to the residential use area which it is intended to serve; 
b.  The size and usability of the land being considered; 
c.  Other existing or proposed recreational facilities capable fulfilling recreational needs of the residents. 
2.  Within the percentage limitations set forth for residential land use above, the developer should provide such recreational space in the nature of play lots, neighborhood parks and district parks, generally in accordance with the following standards and should deviations from the following standards be required, the plan commission may vary these requirements by five percent: 
Classification Approximate Size Acres Per 
1,000 People Play lots Up to one acre 1.0 Neighborhood parks 4 - 10 acres 6.0 District parks 10 - 20 acres 3.0  
a.  "Play lots" are defined as active recreational areas intended for children up to six or seven years of age. They generally feature play apparatus, benches, sand areas and landscaping. Play lots should be located near the center of the housing areas generating children of such ages so that children need not cross arterial streets to reach play lots. 
b.  "Neighborhood parks" are defined as active and passive recreational areas which usually serve children and adults in an urban area within a radius of approximately one-half mile. Neighborhood parks generally adjoin public elementary schools and may include such features as ball diamonds and play areas toward the interior of the site so the perimeter can be landscaped to buffer sound. 
c.  "District parks" are defined as large active and passive recreational areas generally located on or near thoroughfares and within two miles of each residence intended to be served. District parks generally adjoin junior and senior high schools and often include such facilities as swimming pools, tennis complexes, recreational building and adequate off-street parking.

(Ord. No. 12-O-24, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2012) 
17.80.240 - Maintenance of common open space and recreational areas. 
    In the event that the organization established to own and maintain common open space and recreational areas and related facilities, or any successor organization shall at any time after establishment of the planned development fail to maintain the common open space and recreational areas and related facilities in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan, the village may serve written notice upon such organization or upon the residents of the planned development setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the space in a reasonable condition and the notice shall include the following: a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty (30) days. 
    If such deficiencies are not cured within the thirty (30) days, the village shall serve notice of hearing. The notice shall state the date and place of hearing and shall be sent registered mail not less than five days nor more than ten (10) days from the hearing date. At the hearing, if the village finds the deficiencies cannot be cured by the responsible party, the village in order to preserve that taxable values of the properties within the planned development and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the property and maintain the same for a period of one year. The entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common open space or recreational areas when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners. Before the expiration of the year, the village shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such organization or to the residents of the planned development, show cause why such maintenance by the village shall not, at the election of the village, continue for a succeeding year. 
    If the village board shall determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain the common open space and recreation areas in a reasonable condition the village may in its discretion continue to maintain the common open space during the next succeeding year and subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year thereafter. The decision of the village board in any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision subject to review in accordance with appropriate provisions of this title. 
    The cost of such maintenance by the village shall be assessed ratably against the properties with the planned development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space and recreation space and shall upon nonpayment be enforced by law.

Chapter 17.82 - DOWNTOWN PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 
Sections: 

17.82.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A.  One of the principal objectives of this zoning title is to provide for a compatible arrangement of uses of land and buildings which is consistent with the requirements and welfare of the village. To accomplish this objective most uses are classified as permitted or special uses in one or more of the districts established by this zoning title. It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses, whether or not designated as permitted or special, which because of their scope, location or specific characteristics give rise to a need for a more comprehensive consideration of their impact both with regard to the neighboring land and the village in general. Such uses that fall within the provisions of this section shall only be permitted if authorized as a planned development. 
B.  The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section, may grant planned development permits authorizing the establishment of planned developments. 
C.  Planned developments may include uses or combinations of uses currently permitted in the underlying zoning district and those uses which are currently prohibited or special uses provided for elsewhere in this zoning title. However, an applicant may petition for consideration of a use or combination of uses not specifically allowed in the underlying zoning district provided that the village board finds that the conditions, procedures and standards of this section are met and provided further that such use or combination of uses is clearly shown to be beneficial to the village, downtown, and surrounding neighborhoods. 
D.  It is the purpose of planned developments to enable the granting of certain allowances or modifications from the basic provisions of this zoning title to achieve attractive and timely development in furtherance of the village's objectives and proposed land uses as stated in the downtown plan and policy resolutions of the village board. 
E.  Through the flexibility of the planned development process, the village seeks to achieve the following specific objectives: 
1.  Creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible through strict application of other village land use regulations. 
2.  Promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities resulting in better design and development, including aesthetic amenities. 
3.  Combination and coordination of the character, the form, and the relationship of structures to one another. 
4.  Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography, vegetation, and geologic features. 
5.  Provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space, or an appropriate amount of open space over that which would result from the application of conventional zoning regulations. 
6.  Encouragement of land uses or combination of uses that improve upon the character and property values of the village, and promote the public health, safety, comfort, and general welfare of its residents. 
7.  Promotion of long-term planning pursuant to a master plan which will allow harmonious and compatible land uses or combination of uses with surrounding areas. 
F.  The development of village-owned buildings shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. 05-O-31 § 1 (part)) 
17.82.020 - General provisions. 
A.

B.  The development of any parcel or tract of land in any zoning district in the downtown business district for the construction, reconstruction or remodeling of one single-family detached dwelling, may be submitted to the village for consideration as a planned development. 
C.  Each planned development should be presented and judged on its own merits. It shall not be sufficient to base justification for approval of a development upon an already existing planned development except to the extent such development has been approved as part of a master plan. 
D.  The burden of providing evidence and persuasion that any planned development permit is necessary and desirable shall in every case rest with the applicant. 
E.  Buildings and uses or combination of uses within a planned development shall be limited solely to those approved as part of the zoning ordinance granting a planned development permit provided, however, that any buildings and uses or combination of uses in compliance with the master plan approved as part of the zoning ordinance granting a planned development permit may be approved by the downtown development district board and the village board of trustees. 
F.  Any applicant shall be subject to a penalty of up to seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per day to be assessed against the applicant and recorded as a lien against the applicant's property in the village for failure to comply with any condition, contingency or master plan submitted by the applicant or imposed by the village to comply with this chapter. 
(Ord. 05-O-31 § 1 (part)) 
17.82.030 - Standards for review. 
    An application for approval as a planned development shall be granted by the board of trustees only if it finds that the applicant has demonstrated that at a minimum the proposed use or combination of uses complies with the following standards: 
A.  The proposed use or combination of uses is consistent with the goals and policies of the downtown plan; 
B.  The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use or combination of uses will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, morals, or general welfare of the residents of the village; 
C.  The proposed use or combination of uses will not diminish the use or enjoyment of other property in the vicinity for those uses or combination of uses which are permitted by this zoning title;

K.  The design of the proposed use or combination of uses promotes a safe and comfortable pedestrian environment; 
L.  The applicant has the financial and technical capacity to complete the proposed use or combination of uses and has made adequate provisions to guarantee the development of any buffers, landscaping, public open space, and other improvements associated with the proposed use or combination of uses; 
M.  The proposed use or combination of uses is economically viable and does not pose a current or potential burden upon the services, tax base, or other economic factors that affect the financial operations of the village, except to the extent that such burden is balanced by the benefit derived by the village from the proposed use; and 
N.  The proposed use or combination of uses will meet the objectives and other requirements set forth in this section. 
(Ord. 05-O-31 § 1 (part)) 
17.82.040 - Site development allowances. 
A.  Site development allowances, i.e., alterations or variations from the underlying zoning provisions set forth outside this chapter may be approved provided the applicant specifically identifies each such site development allowance and demonstrates how each such site development allowance would be compatible with surrounding development and is in furtherance of the stated objectives of this section.

Chapter 17.100 - SPECIAL USES 
Sections: 

17.100.010 - Purpose. 
    The development and execution of this title is based upon the division of the community into districts within which districts the use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. 
    It is recognized, however, that certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use in the particular location. Such special use falls into two categories: 
A.  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest; and 
B.  Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. Planned developments are considered in this category. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.10-1) 
17.100.020 - Initiation of special use. 
    Any person having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest, and which is specifically enforceable may file an application to use such land for one or more of the special uses provided for in this title in the zoning district in which the land is located. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.10-2) 
17.100.030 - Application for special use. 
    An application for a special use shall be filed with the zoning administrator on a form prescribed by the zoning administrator. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data prescribed by the plan commission, and shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth in Section 17.100.060. 
    Such application shall be forwarded from the zoning administrator to the plan commission with a request to review the application and accompanying data, conduct a public hearing hereon, and submit written recommendations, thereon to the village board of trustees. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.10-3) 
17.100.040 - Hearing on application for special use. 
    Within thirty (30) days of receipt of any application for a special use, the plan commission shall hold a public hearing on the application, at such time and place as shall be established by legal advertisement (notice of hearing) by the plan commission. The hearing shall be conducted and a record or the proceedings shall be preserved in such manner as the village board shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.10-4) 
17.100.050 - Notice of hearing. 
    Notice of time and place of the hearing shall be published at least once in the official newspaper not more than thirty (30), nor less than fifteen (15) days before such hearing. Supplemental or additional notices may be published or distributed as the village board may, by rule, prescribe from time to time. Additionally, any area for which an individual application requests a special use, there shall be an additional notice posted on the premises for at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing. 
    The posted notices shall be in number, size and location, as prescribed by the zoning administrator and shall indicate the present zoning classification, the proposed special use, the time and place of public hearing, and any other information prescribed by the zoning administrator. Posted notices shall be removed by the applicant from the subject area within fifteen (15) days after the public hearing has been held. Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this title. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.10-5) 
17.100.060 - Finding of fact and recommendations of plan commission. 
    The plan commission shall make written findings of fact and shall refer to any exhibits containing plans and specifications for the proposed special uses, which shall remain a part of the permanent record of the plan commission. The plan commission shall submit same together with its recommendations to the village board for final action. No special use shall be recommended by the plan commission, unless such commission shall find: 
A.  That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare; 
B.  That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood; 
C.  That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district; 
D.  That the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of any proposed structure will not be so at variance with either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of the structural already constructed or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood or the character of the applicable district, as to cause a substantial depreciation in the property values within the neighborhood; 
E.  That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been or are being provided; 
F.  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets; 
G.  That the special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the village board pursuant to the recommendations of the plan commission. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.10-6) 
17.100.070 - Terms of relief-Conditions and guarantees. 
    Prior to the granting of any special use, the plan commission shall in a conclusion or paragraph, separate from the findings of fact, stipulate the terms of relief recommended. 
    The plan commission may also stipulate any conditions and restrictions, upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in Section 17.100.060. In all cases in which special uses are recommended, the plan commission may require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection herewith are being and will be complied with. 
(Zoning ord. § 4.10-7) 
17.100.080 - Action by village board of trustees. 
A.  The village board shall not act upon a proposed special use permitted under this title until it shall have received a written report and recommendation from the plan commission on the proposed special use. 
B.  The village board may grant or deny, by ordinance or resolution, any application for special use, and may establish such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special use, as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in Section 17.100.060. 
C.  In all cases where the village board permits the establishment of a special use, the terms of the relief granted shall be specifically set forth in the ordinance or resolution in a conclusion.
