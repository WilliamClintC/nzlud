PREFACE 
    The Belmont City Code is a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the Council. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code repeals all ordinances inconsistent herewith. The Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and effecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitant of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, vacating streets, etc., are not included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. The source of each section is cited in parentheses following the section. The absence of such a citation indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 7 is numbered 7-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its title and, at the same time, new sections may be inserted in their proper places by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration, if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-16 and 4-17 is to be added, the new sections would be numbered 4-16.1, 4-16.2, and 4-16.3. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number. Thus, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangements of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and divisions may be included in the same way, or in case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the volumes, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 13 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volumes. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference. 
Index 
    The general index to the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each item has been placed under several headings, some of the hearings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.

ARTICLE V. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES 

Sec. 4-74. - Purpose. 
    In adopting this article, it is recognized that certain types of adult entertainment facilities possess certain objectionable operational characteristics which when concentrated can have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. It is also recognized that locating the adult entertainment facilities covered by this particle in the vicinity of facilities frequented by minors will cause the exposure of minors to adult material which, because of their immaturity, may adversely affect them. In addition, it is recognized that many persons are offended by the public display of certain sexual material. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood and to an adverse effect on minors.

ARTICLE IV. - REGULATION OF PYGMY GOATS 

Sec. 5-50. - Purposes. 
(a)  The purposes of this article are to preserve the health and safety of the people by regulating pygmy goats of the genus Capra hircus, in single-family residential zones, and to control and abate nuisance activities arising out of the keeping and maintaining of pygmy goats. 
(b)  The city council intends that provisions of this article shall take force and effect as provided herein despite any claims of grandfathered rights under traditional zoning laws. 
(c)  This article is adopted under the city's general police power to protect the public health and safety. 
(Ord. No. 1011, § 2, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 5-51. - Definitions. 
    As used herein, the following words shall have the meanings shown. 
    "Pygmy goat" means an animal of the genus and species Capra hircus. 
(Ord. No. 1011, § 2, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 5-52. - Findings. 
    The city council finds that regulation of pygmy goats is necessary to protect the public health and safety of city residents and visitors, as evidenced by the following facts. 
    Staff has received inquiries about the keeping of pygmy goats in residential districts. According to Article II of Chapter 5 (Animals and Fowl) of the Belmont City Code, pygmy goats are considered livestock such as horses, cows, sheep, llamas and full-size goats. The minimum lot area upon which no more than two (2) livestock animals may be kept is one (1) acre. However, pygmy goats are smaller than other breeds of livestock and typically owned as pets. Pygmy goats range in height from fifteen (15) inches to seventeen (17) inches at the shoulders and range in weight from eight (8) to thirty-six (36) pounds. They are native to Africa and were initially raised for meat, but are typically considered pets in the United States. 
    Regulation of keeping and maintaining pygmy goats within the city is necessary to protect the public health and safety of residents and visitors and to reduce or eliminate potential nuisances. Because of the health and sanitation risks associated with keeping and maintaining pygmy goats, this article shall take force and effect on the dates provided herein despite any claims of grandfathered rights under traditional zoning laws. 
    Although pygmy goats are considered easier to maintain and substantially cleaner than typical livestock animals, it is common knowledge that unaltered male goats produce a musky, offensive odor to attract female goats. Goat manure may also cause offensive odors. In addition, braying from goats may cause noise nuisances to neighboring residents. 
(Ord. No. 1011, § 2, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 5-53. - Prohibitions. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain a pygmy goat anywhere in the city, except as provided in this article. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful to keep and maintain an unaltered male pygmy goat in any zoning district in the City of Belmont. 
(Ord. No. 1011, § 2, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 5-54. - Pygmy goat permit for keeping pygmy goats. 
(a)  Up to two (2) altered male or female pygmy goats shall be permitted in the following zoning districts: R-1E, R-1H, R-1A, R-1B, HRO-1, HRO-2, HRO-3 and A, provided they are contained in appropriate pens or fenced in areas properly sized and constructed, and the area and animals are maintained in a clean, odor-free condition. All pygmy goats shall have their horn buds removed. 
(b)  Any person keeping or maintaining a pygmy goat in areas provided for in subsection 5.54(a) must obtain a permit in writing from the community development department. 
(c)  Every application for a permit to keep and maintain pygmy goats shall be made upon forms to be furnished for that purpose by the planning division, signed by the applicant and filed with the planning division. No such application shall be received for filing by the planning division unless accompanied by a filing fee set forth in the master fee schedule. 
(d)  The community development department shall deny the granting of a pygmy goat permit unless it finds that all criteria set forth in this article have been met and that such use is not detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the applicants and adjoining residents and property owners. 
(e)  Nothing herein shall authorize the issuing of a permit to keep or maintain pygmy goats for breeding, market or commercial purposes in any zone or in violation of any other ordinance of the City of Belmont. 
(f)  A required condition of approval for a pygmy goat permit shall be a requirement that the permittee maintain an area housing the animal(s) in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
(g)  The number of pygmy goat permits issued each calendar year shall not exceed twenty (20). 
(h)  The community development department may impose such conditions on the granting of a permit as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this article.

(Ord. No. 630, § 3, 6-26-78) 
Sec. 7-12. - Determination of geotechnical hazards; geotechnical reports; procedure for review; geologic hazards in San Juan Hills area. 
(a)  Prior to the issuance of a building or grading permit, the building official shall ascertain whether the proposed site, or portion thereof, is located in an area of potential geotechnical hazard as defined in the text and maps of the adopted seismic safety element of the Belmont general plan. If a site meets any one of the following criteria, it shall be considered to have potential geotechnical hazards which warrant further, more specific recommendations: 
(1)  The site is located on a mapped active, potentially active or inactive fault; 
(2)  The site is located in an area where the following are generally known to exist: 
a.  Expansive soils; 
b.  Moderate to low stability of cuts; 
c.  Fair to poor earthquake stability; 
d.  Fair to poor foundation conditions; 
e.  High susceptibility to landsliding. 
(3)  The site is located in an area where, in the opinion of the building official based upon his knowledge of the conditions in the area, potential geological hazards may exist which could adversely affect the proposed development or surrounding public and private improvements. In making the decision as to whether a site may have potential geotechnical hazards, the building official shall refer to the adopted seismic safety element of the Belmont general plan and may refer to such other published and unpublished documents, including but not limited to the maps and reports of the U.S. Geological Survey, "San Francisco Bay Region Environment and Resources Planning Study." 
(b)  Should the site, or area to be affected by the development, fall within the above categories, the applicant shall submit a preliminary opinion from a registered soils engineer as to the degree of hazard associated with the proposed development and recommendations where further studies are needed. Should said soils engineer recommend further investigations or studies, they shall be prepared prior to the issuance of a building permit. Any geologic reports submitted to the building official in compliance with this section shall be transmitted to the city geologist, who shall review and provide comments and recommendations upon the adequacy of said report. When the city geologist has determined that the report and recommendations are adequate, said recommendation shall be incorporated into the development plan and specifications, and adherence to those recommendations shall be a condition of the building permit. Such decision shall be subject to review and approval by the city planning commission. 
(c)  Nothing contained in this section shall require the submittal of a geologic report where an adequate geologic report has been previously prepared, submitted and accepted by the City of Belmont. Determination of report adequacy shall be made by the building official, who may seek the advice of the city officials in making said determination. 
(d)  Geologic Hazards in San Juan Hills Area. The city council recognizes that geologic hazards threaten life and property in certain locations in the city. It is the intent of the city council that land subject to hazardous geologic conditions be used and developed in a manner that protects public health, safety and welfare. The city council has obtained geologic maps based on study of aerial photographs, field investigations and other available geologic studies which portray the geologic conditions of the San Juan Canyon Study Area with considerable accuracy. Given this level of information, the city council finds it appropriate to adopt these maps and related land use policies to guide all decisions to which they are relevant. 
(1)  Purpose. The purposes of this subsection are: 
a.  To prevent increases in the potential for loss of life, injury and property damage caused by geologic hazards in the San Juan Hills Area. 
b.  To specify geologic maps which will serve as a consistent basis for evaluating development applications in the San Juan Hills Area. 
c.  To control land development in the San Juan Hills Area in a manner consistent with known geologic conditions. 
d.  To protect the city from liability from failure to consider available geologic information in making development decisions. 
(2)  Applicability. This subsection shall apply to all properties shown on the Engineering Geology Map and Ground Movement Potential Map as the San Juan Canyon Study Area. Actions under the zoning, subdivision and grading ordinances shall be consistent with the provisions of this subsection. 
(3)  Adoption of geologic maps. The city hereby adopts the Engineering Geologic Map (April 1985) and Ground Movement Potential Map (April 1985) prepared at a scale of 1" = 200' by William Cotton and Associates as official geologic maps for the San Juan Hills Area. 
(4)  Modification of geologic maps. Further study may indicate the need to modify the geologic maps by adjusting the boundaries between map units. Modifications can be made as follows: 
a.  An applicant, property owner, or authorized representative of a property owner may initiate proceedings to modify the geologic maps. 
b.  Documentation of the reasons for modification consisting of map at a scale of 1" = 200' or larger and a report prepared by a certified engineering geologist shall be submitted with all applications for geologic map modification. 
c.  The city geologist shall review all such applications and prepare a written report to the planning and community development department containing his or her findings and recommendations. The modification may be approved by the planning and community development director if the city geologist finds: 1) that new information has been provided which demonstrates that the existing boundary is inaccurate; and 2) that the proposed change will correct and update the map. 
d.  Decisions by the planning and community development director may be appealed by the applicant to the city council. 
e.  Modifications to the maps may be initiated by the city council upon recommendation of the city geologist. In such cases, the city council will hold a noticed public hearing on the proposed modification. Following the public hearing, the city council may modify the maps, if the city geologist finds: 1) that new information has been provided which demonstrates that the existing boundary is inaccurate; and 2) that the proposed change will correct and update the map. 
f.  Changes to the maps will be posted within thirty (30) days of approval of a map modification. Each change will be identified on the map by date, file number or other means of identification determined appropriate by the planning and community development director. 
(5)  Maintenance of maps and records. The planning and community development department shall be responsible for maintaining the geologic maps and records of actions modifying the maps. Up-to-date maps and copies of geologic and geotechnical reports will be kept at city hall in the planning and community development department. 
(6)  Geologic criteria for development. Table 1 establishes the land use restrictions based on geologic hazards which will apply in considering applications for building and grading permits, rezoning, formation of assessment districts, and divisions of land within the San Juan Hills Area where: 
a.  Residential uses include all single-family and multiple-family residential structures and accessory structures, including garages and driveways, which are permitted or conditional uses in residential districts. 
b.  Roads include both public and private rights-of-way. 
c.  Intensive and critical uses include schools, churches and uses with comparable occupancy characteristics; and structures and facilities critical to the city's ability to respond to a disaster or maintain an acceptable level of public safety, such as fire stations and water tanks.

Y  Yes (permitted) 
Y* The land use would be permitted, provided geologic data indicates geologic conditions and/or engineering solutions are favorable. 
N* The land use would not be permitted unless geologic data indicates geologic conditions are more favorable than mapped or engineering solutions will reduce the risk to acceptable levels. 
N  No, the use is not permitted. The map must be changed to show that this hazard does not exist before development will be allowed. The map change must be based on geologic data showing that the map was in error or that improvements have been undertaken which remove the hazard. 
(7)  Exceptions to the geologic criteria. Exemptions to the geologic criteria may be authorized by the city under the following circumstances: 
a.  Alterations to existing structures. The building official shall issue a building permit for alteration to an existing structure rated Y*, N*, or N in table 1 without requiring additional geologic or geotechnical investigation, if the alteration will not modify the structure's foundation. If the alteration will modify the structure's foundation, the application shall be referred to the city geologist, who shall specify any geologic or geotechnical investigations needed before a building permit can be processed. 
b.  Construction of accessory structures and appurtenances. The building official shall issue a building permit for the construction of accessory structures and appurtenances, including garages, decks, swimming pools, gazebos and other such structures, which are not intended for living space, on lots with an existing primary use and rated as Y*, N* or N on table 1, if the city engineer finds, based on available information, that the construction will not endanger the stability of the site or any adjacent property. If information is not available to permit such a finding, the city engineer shall refer the application to the city geologist, who shall specify any geologic or geotechnical investigations needed before a building permit can be processed. 
c.  Repair or reconstruction of a damaged building. The building official shall issue a building permit for the repair or reconstruction of any building which is rated Y*, N*, or N in table 1 and is more than fifty (50) percent destroyed by causes other than ground movement, if the city engineer finds, based on available information, that the repair or reconstruction will not significantly endanger the stability of the site or any adjacent property. If information is not available to permit such finding, the city engineer shall refer the application to the city geologist, who shall specify any geologic or geotechnical investigations needed before a building permit can be processed. 
d.  Other exceptions/planning commission consideration and action. An application for any project (building, rezoning, land division, formation of an assessment district, road construction, or grading) which deviates from the criteria in table 1, other than those specified in a, b and c above, must be submitted to the department of planning and community development and accompanied by a geotechnical report or engineering geologic report prepared according to a scope of work approved by the city geologist. The city geologist shall review the report and submit findings and recommendations to the department of zoning and planning and community development. The application shall be considered by the planning commission, which may approve the application upon recommendation of the city geologist. 
(8)  Preparation and review of geologic and geotechnical reports. All geologic and geotechnical reports will be prepared in conformance with guidelines available from the city. Reports submitted in support of site improvements will contain a statement of a California certified engineering geologist that proposed projects, as designed, will be reasonably safe for geologic hazards. The city geologist will review all reports. For a project to be approved, the city geologist must find that the proposed project would not significantly endanger the stability of the site or any other property. Recommendations of the city geologist will become conditions for any development which is approved. The applicant's geologist will inspect work in progress to ascertain adherence to the conditions and certify the completed project as conforming to the approved plans. 
(Ord. No. 630, § 3, 6-26-78; Ord. No. 794, § 2, 5-24-88) 
Sec. 7-13. - Streets required. 
(a)  Before issuing a building permit for the construction of any building, the building official shall ascertain that the proposed site is adjacent to and served by streets that are improved to current city standards adopted by the city council and adequate for the use proposed for the structure for which the permit is sought. When the building official needs assistance in determining the improvement and adequacy of a street, he or she shall consult with the city engineer. In the event that such streets do not meet current city standards, the permit may be issued upon the dedication of a right-of-way where necessary and the execution of an agreement to install either before occupancy or deferred to a later date such improvements as are determined by the city engineer to be necessary in a manner satisfactory to the city engineer. An agreement for construction of improvements before occupancy shall be secured by a bond in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated costs of the improvements. The city engineer may recommend that the bond be waived when, in his or her opinion, circumstances make a waiver desirable. The city engineer may require a bond to secure improvements to be constructed after occupancy. An agreement to construct improvements either before or after occupancy shall be recorded with the county recorder before issuance of a building permit for the building to secure the future construction of the improvements. 
(b)  As used herein, "construction of any building" means the construction of a new building or an addition of twenty-five (25) percent or more of the square footage on an existing building, provided that in no case shall improvements be requested in excess of the estimated cost of the addition. 
(c)  In cases where there are extraordinary conditions affecting the property, an applicant may request that the planning commission modify the strict application of subsection (a). In such cases, the applicant shall request an informal hearing before the planning commission, and if after such hearing the commission finds that by following the strict letter of subsection (a), unreasonable restrictions, unnecessary and extraordinary hardship or damage will be imposed upon the applicant, then the provisions hereof may be modified, in harmony with the general purpose and objectives hereof and in a manner that will protect the public health, safety and welfare of the people of the city. 
(d)  A decision of the planning commission under subsection (c) may be appealed to the city council by any person adversely affected by such decision by filing a notice of the appeal with the city clerk within 10 days after the action by the commission is taken. The city council shall proceed to hear and determine the matter, considering the action of the planning commission. 
(e)  Hillside Road Standards - San Juan Hills. 
(1)  Purposes. The purposes of this subsection are to: 
a.  Provide for safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians in the San Juan Hills. 
b.  Minimize grading and vegetation removal in constructing roads in the San Juan Hills by controlling the grade, widths of rights-of-way and paving, and other design and construction features.

Table 1: Paved Width of Hillside Roads 
Paved Element Minimum Width Traffic lanes ..... 20.0' (two 10-foot lanes) Gutters ..... 3.0' (1.5' each side) Curbs ..... 1.0' (0.5' each side) Parking lanes ..... 11.0' (5.5' each side)* Sidewalks ..... 10.0' (5.0' each side)** Total width ..... 45.0'  
*  Effective width is 7.0' per side including 1.5' gutter. 
**  Effective width is 5.5' per side including 0.5' curb. 
(6)  Elimination of sidewalks and/or parking lanes. When necessary to meet the purposes of this subsection, the width of a proposed hillside road or road segment may be reduced by eliminating sidewalks and/or parking lanes in the following order: 
a.  Sidewalk on one side. 
b.  Sidewalk and parking lane on one side. 
c.  Sidewalks on both sides and parking lane on one side. 
Changes in total width shall be at least one hundred (100) feet apart within a single road improvement project.

   1. If the proposed road improvement is 100 feet long or less, cross slopes shall be calculated at the beginning, midpoint and end, and averaged. 
   2. If the proposed road improvement is over 100 feet long, cross slopes shall be calculated at least every 50 feet and averaged for each 100 foot segment. 
**  Road construction is not normally permitted where the cross slope exceeds 50% unless detailed engineering evaluation demonstrates that safe, stable construction is possible. 
(7)  Exceptions. Exceptions to any of the hillside road standards may be granted by the administrative or legislative body approving the road improvement project upon recommendation of the city engineer based on consultation with the fire chief and appropriate engineering evaluations. To grant an exception, the approving body must make all of the following findings: 
a.  Granting the exception will not unduly impair vehicular or pedestrian safety, or emergency access. 
b.  Granting the exception will result in road improvement which is consistent with the San Juan Hills Area Plan and other city ordinances. 
c.  Reducing the standard is necessary to avoid excessive grading or vegetation removal or to reduce the risk of erosion, flooding or slope failure. 
(8)  Authorization of right-of-way width of less than forty feet. This paragraph, when adopted by a four-fifths vote of the city council, authorizes the city engineer to approve plans for hillside roads with rights-of-way narrower than forty (40) feet as required by section 1805 of the California Streets and Highways Code, when those roads will be constructed in accord with the standards set forth in this subsection. 
(9)  Improvement plans for unimproved roads. To ensure adequate emergency access, public safety, and drainage improvements, the city requires an approved road improvement plan prior to granting a building permit for a new structure or enlargement of an existing structure on property accessible only from an unimproved road. The road improvement plan specifies the design and financing of road improvements for an entire unimproved road or unimproved segment on which the property is located. The plan must be submitted by property owner(s) to the city engineer along with a fee set by resolution of the city council. Two (2) types of plans are permitted. 
a.  A plan for an entire unimproved road which shall include: 
1.  A plan for grading prepared by a registered civil engineer meeting specifications set by the city engineer. The plan must provide sufficient detail to show clearly the extent and impact of proposed grading, including the limits of the area to be graded; locations, dimensions and slopes of cuts and fills; existing and proposed finished grade; location and heights of proposed retention systems; proposals for drainage and erosion control. 
2.  Design for road improvements meeting the standards of this subsection. 
3.  Report signed by a licensed geotechnical engineer, based on geologic and geotechnical investigation of the alignment and review of the preliminary design, concluding that the proposed road will be geologically stable as per section 7-12(d).

c.  Reimbursement agreement upon approval. When a subdivider, land developer, person or persons is required to provide a hillside road improvement plan and/or the construction of said hillside road together with other improvements which will benefit other properties to be developed under the provisions of this section, the city shall, upon recommendation of the city engineer and approval of the city council, enter into an agreement with the subdivider, land developer, person or persons for the recovery of that portion of the cost of said hillside road improvement plan and improvements which benefit properties not owned or controlled by the subdivider, land developer, person or persons. The agreement may, but shall not necessarily, provide for payment to the subdivider, land developer, person or persons an amount attributable to interest as the council may direct. The reimbursement agreement shall contain at least the following provisions: 
1.  The city shall be obligated to make reimbursements to subdivider or land developer only when and as the city obtains funds from benefiting property owners as such benefiting property owners eventually improve their property. 
2.  Any funds paid by benefiting property owners to the city need not be paid over to the subdivider or land developer until the limitations period for instituting court action to seek a refund of such funds paid under protests has passed, and no court action has been instituted; in the event court action is instituted, the city shall not pay over such funds to the subdivider or land developer until the court action has been finalized and the authority of the city to collect such charges has been sustained. 
3.  The city shall have the right to turn over the defense of any action seeking refund of amounts paid under protest to the subdivider or land developer; if the subdivider or land developer fails to undertake the defense of the action at the subdivider's own expense, the city may stipulate to return of the funds so paid under protest by or on behalf of the owner or owners of any such benefiting property, and the city shall not be further obligated to subdivider or land developer as to any such funds so refunded. In the event a court action is maintained to prevent the city from collecting such funds from benefiting property owners, the city shall have the right to turn over the defense of that action to the subdivider or land developer, who shall agree to hold the city harmless from any and all liability thereunder; in the event the subdivider fails to undertake defense of the action at subdivider or land developer's sole expense, the city may stipulate to cease collecting such funds, or enter into any other settlement of the litigation acceptable to the city, and subdivider or land developer shall lose any right to reimbursement under the reimbursement agreement. 
4.  The reimbursement agreement shall provide for reimbursement of all funds less cost incurred by the city, when and as collected, without interest, unless the council otherwise determines. Under no circumstances shall the city be deemed liable for any funds not so collected from benefiting property owners. 
5.  It shall be the responsibility of the person(s) to be reimbursed to keep the city apprised of said person(s) address during the term of this agreement. In the event the city is unable to locate the developer at the time that any fees are actually collected, the city shall hold such fees for the benefit of the developer or its successor or assignee for a period of three (3) years. Upon the expiration of the three year period, any fees not reimbursed to said person(s) shall escheat to the city and the city shall be free and clear of any obligation to said person(s). 
6.  No building permit shall be issued for property that has been assigned a pro rata share of the cost of preparing a hillside road plan and the cost of constructing the road and other improvements until the cost allocated to the property as its share of said cost has been paid. Said cost may be paid at any time prior to issuance of the building permit. 
7.  The city shall deduct from the reimbursement cost when collected any and all cost and expense incurred by the city for the administration and enforcement of the reimbursement agreement. Said cost and expenses are deemed to be the cost and expense of the applicant. 
8.  A description of each of the properties benefited by the hillside improvement plan and/or the construction of said hillside road together with other improvements. 
9.  The length of time the agreement is to remain in effect as determined by the city council. 
d.  Report from city engineer. Prior to entering into a reimbursement agreement pursuant to this subsection, the city council shall receive a report from the city engineer describing in detail the entire area which is benefited by the improvements and recommending the apportionment of the costs of such improvements based upon the benefit to such property. The apportionment of benefit shall be on the basis of frontage upon such improvements, acreage served by such improvements, or any other formula rationally related to actual benefit. The city council may approve the report as submitted, or modify the report, and the action of the city council thereon shall determine the benefit to each piece or parcel of property outside the subdivision or single parcel to be developed benefited by such improvements, establish the amount or amounts to be charged such properties, and direct the method of collection of the costs of such improvements. The action of the city council shall be final. 
e.  Determination of benefit. In determining the benefit to each piece or parcel of property, the city council shall, unless consent of all affected property owners is filed with the city, hold a public hearing thereon and give notice by mail to property owners of record who would be affected by such determination, and provide to all such property owners an opportunity to appear and be heard upon the proposed determination of benefit and method of apportioning of costs thereof. Notices shall be sent to affected property owners of record as shown on the last equalized assessment roll at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Any action by the city council under this subsection shall be taken only at a regular or special meeting of the city council for which public notice has been given as required by the Ralph M. Brown Act, as amended. 
f.  Audit of project costs. Upon completion of the construction of the hillside road and other improvements which are the subject of the reimbursement agreement, an audit of the plan preparation and construction costs shall be performed by a consultant selected by the city and paid for by the subdivider, land developer, person or persons who are parties to the reimbursement agreement, to verify the total cost of plan preparation and construction. If the costs are less than originally determined for the purpose of determining benefit and allocation of the cost, the city manager may administratively reduce the pro rata allocation of costs to be collected to reflect the audited cost. 
g.  Recordation of agreement. The reimbursement agreement approved by the city council shall be recorded in the official records of the County Recorder of the County of San Mateo.

ARTICLE IX. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 786, adopted Jan. 26, 1988, amended art. IX to read as set out in §§ 7-201-7-222. The article formerly consisted of §§ 7-201-7-207 as adopted by Ord. No. 681, § 1, adopted Sept. 10, 1980, as amended. Subsequently, Ord. No. 975, § 1, adopted Nov. 27, 2001, amended art. IX to read as herein set out. See the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 7-201. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of City of Belmont does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-202. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of City of Belmont are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-203. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
(7)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-204. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-205. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. 
    "Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
    "Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. 
    "Apex" means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one (1) to three (3) feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" See "special flood hazard area." 
    "Area of special flood-related erosion hazard" is the land within a community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). 
    "Area of special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard" is the area subject to severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as Zone M on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM).

    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood, flooding, or flood water" means: 
(1)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
(2)  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
    "Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
    "Flood hazard boundary map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
    "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Flood-related erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    "Flood-related erosion area" or "Flood-related erosion prone area" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage. 
    "Flood-related erosion area management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source see "Flooding". 
    "Floodplain administrator" is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway". 
    "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
    "Fraud and victimization" as related to sections 7-220.6 through 7-222 of this article, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the {community governing body} will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    "Hardship" as related to sections 7-220.6 through 7-222 of this article means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "basement" definition). 
(1)  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet floodproofing standard in section 7-217(c)(3). 
b.  The anchoring standards in section 7-217(a). 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in section 7-217(b). 
d.  The standards for utilities in section 7-218. 
(2)  For residential structures, all subgrade-enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    "Mudslide" describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. 
    "Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area" means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow. 
    "New construction", for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. 
    "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    "One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" see "base flood." 
    "Public safety and nuisance" as related to section 7-222, Variances, of this article means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Sheet flow area" see "area of shallow flooding". 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH. 
    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

(5)  Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in sections 7-220.6 through 7-222. 
(6)  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this article as specified in section 7-209. 
(7)  Substantial improvement and substantial damage procedures . 
a.  Develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, and include process for determining "market value" of structures; and 
b.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.

(2)  Meet the permit requirements of sections 7-214 through 7-216.1 of this article and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection 7-220.1(a). 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-220.3. - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 7-208 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply. 
(1)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in [the base] flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 220.3(1) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 7-217 through 7-220.5. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-220.4. - Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas. 
(a)  The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area. 
(b)  Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to the 
(1)  Type and quality of soils, 
(2)  Evidence of ground water or surface water problems, 
(3)  Depth and quality of any fill, 
(4)  Overall slope of the site, and 
(5)  Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope. 
(c)  Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administrator shall require that 
(1)  A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering; 
(2)  The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages; 
(3)  The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site of [or] off-site disturbances; and 
(4)  drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-220.5. - Flood-related erosion-prone area. 
(a)  The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community. 
(b)  Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
(c)  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
(d)  Within Zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-220.6. - Nature of variances. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section of the article are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. [The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-221. - Appeal board. 
(a)  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and the 
(1)  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
(4)  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
(11)  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
(b)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that; 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the San Mateo recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(c)  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 975, § 1, 11-27-01) 
Sec. 7-222. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of section 7-220.6 of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in section 7-205 of this article) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this article. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon a; 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in section 7-205 of this article) to the applicant; and 
(3)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in section 7-205 see "public safety or nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in section 7-205) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections 7-222(a) through (e) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 7-221(a) and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

(Ord. No. 2014-1081 , § 1, 11-25-14) 
Sec. 17-52. - Use of fees. 
(a)  The fees imposed by the city under this article shall be used to pay, in whole or in part, the estimated reasonable cost of providing specified capital improvements, the need for which is attributable to development projects. 
(b)  As described in each implementing resolution, the fees shall be imposed based on specified capital improvement categories, which may include, without limitation, fees for transportation improvements, park land and facilities, police and fire facilities, affordable housing, and other capital improvements. 
(c)  For each separate improvement category, a separate fee shall be calculated and imposed, and each separately imposed fee shall be collected by the city and deposited in a separate and distinct "fee fund," subject to the accounting requirements of the Mitigation Fee Act. 
(d)  To more effectively mitigate the impact of new development and maximize the use of fee revenues, fee revenues may be used as temporary loans from one (1) fee fund to another fee fund if the director makes findings, subject to the review and approval of the city council, of the following: 
(1)  Based upon planned phasing of the capital improvements, and anticipated timing of fee revenues to be collected, it is in the city's best interests to allow the temporary loan. 
(2)  All requirements of the Mitigation Fee Act have been satisfied, including a specification of the amount loaned, the date of repayment, and the interest rate to be paid.

(b)  Each technical report shall: 
(1)  Identify the purpose of the fee by identifying the estimated types and quantities of development projects subject to the fee and their impact on the specified capital improvements. 
(2)  Identify the use of the fee by specifying the category of capital improvements to be funded by the fee. 
(3)  Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the city's use of the fee and the types of development projects on which the fee is to be imposed. 
(4)  Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the capital improvements and the types of development projects on which the fee is to be imposed. 
(5)  Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the specified capital improvement attributable to the development projects on which the fee is to be imposed. This shall include two (2) elements: 
a.  A quantification of the estimated reasonable cost of providing the specified capital improvements, which may include the estimated costs of land acquisition, design, construction, construction administration, general administration (including establishment and enforcement) of the fee program, and contingencies; and 
b.  An identification of the method by which the city quantifies the proportionate responsibility of each development project for the cost of the specified capital improvements, which may be satisfied by establishing a formula which reasonably quantifies the proportionate responsibility of various types of development projects using standardized units of measurement.

Sec. 17-104. - Standards and formula for dedication of parkland. 
(a)  Parkland dedication standard. The city's General Plan establishes a goal of five (5) acres of parkland per one thousand (1,000) residents. However, under the Quimby Act, the city's maximum dedication requirement is its existing ratio of neighborhood and community parks per one thousand (1,000) residents. The area of existing neighborhood and community parks is 3.87 acres per one thousand (1,000) residents. For purposes of this article, the city therefore adopts a parkland dedication standard of 3.87 acres of parkland for every one thousand (1,000) persons. 
(b)  Calculation of dedication requirement. Under the Quimby Act, a subdivision's dedication requirement is calculated based on the average number of persons for each dwelling unit type (single-family, single-family attached, multi-family) as established by the most recent federal census. The average household size in the 2010 federal census is shown in Columns 1 and 2 in the following table. The parkland dedication requirement per dwelling type (Column 3) is computed by multiplying the average number of persons per dwelling type in Column 2 by the dedication standard in subsection (a). The subdivision's acreage dedication requirement (Column 4) is calculated by multiplying Column 3 by the number of dwelling units of each dwelling unit type contained in the subdivision and adding up the total acreage.

_____
Sec. 17-105. - Formula for fees in-lieu of parkland dedication. 
(a)  When a fee is required to be paid in-lieu of parkland dedication, the amount of the fee is be based upon the amount of land required to be dedicated as determined in section 17-104(b). The city council will establish a fee amount per acre of land required to be dedicated based on the estimated fair market value of land in the city. The city council will establish the fee amount by resolution which it may amend from time to time. 
(b)  A subdivider may request that the city complete an appraisal of the fair market value of the subdivided property. The appraisal shall be completed by a certified MAI appraiser retained by the city at the subdivider's expense. If the appraisal determines that the fair market value of the subdivided property varies from the estimated fair market value adopted by the city council by more than five (5) percent, the in-lieu fee shall be based on the appraised value of the subdivided property as determined by the appraisal. 
(Ord. No. 2014-1082 , § 3, 11-25-14) 
Sec. 17-106. - Use of in-lieu fees. 
(a)  All in-lieu fees collected shall be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision. As specified in the City of Belmont Park and Open Space Master Plan, community parks serve an area within a four-mile radius, and so serve residents in the entire city and all subdivisions. Neighborhood parks serve subdivisions that are within a one-half-mile radius of the park or within the same planning area, as planning areas are shown in the City of Belmont Park and Open Space Master Plan. 
(b)  The city shall develop a schedule specifying how, when, and where it will use the fees to acquire and develop park or recreational facilities to serve the residents of the subdivision. Fees not committed within the timeframe required by Government Code Section 66477(a)(6) shall be distributed as provided therein. 
(Ord. No. 2014-1082 , § 3, 11-25-14) 
Sec. 17-107. - Procedure and standards for determining requirement for land or fee for tentative maps. 
(a)  Parks and recreation commission review. Before the approval of any tentative map with fifty (50) or more units, any condominium project with fifty (50) or more dwelling units, any tentative map or tentative parcel map where parkland dedication is proposed or improvements to dedicated parkland are proposed, or any tentative map or tentative parcel map where a credit for private recreational facilities is proposed, the park and recreation commission shall consider, after a report and recommendation from the park and recreation director, whether land should be dedicated, whether in-lieu fees should be paid by the subdivider, whether improvements should be made to neighborhood or community parks or dedicated land, whether a credit should be given for private recreational facilities, or any combination, in accordance with the standards in this article and the criteria listed in this section. The recommendation of the park and recreation commission shall be submitted to the approving body in its review of the tentative map or tentative parcel map. 
(b)  Suitability of proposed parkland. Land proposed for dedication must meet the following standards: 
(1)  Use of the land as parkland must be consistent with the goals and policies General Plan, any applicable specific plan, and the City of Belmont Park and Open Space Master Plan. 
(2)  The proposed parkland must be suitable for the type of park being developed considering location, physical attributes, sufficiency of size and shape, constraints, and proximity to existing parkland. 
(3)  The proposed parkland must have access to a public street. 
(4)  Park and recreational purposes may include land for the activity of "recreational community gardening," as defined in the Quimby Act. 
(c)  Parkland outside a subdivision. The city may approve the proposed dedication of parkland not located within the subdivision provided that the land proposed for dedication will serve the subdivision as described in section 17-106(a) and is otherwise suitable as described in this section 17-107(b). 
(d)  Fee in lieu of dedication. If the proposed dedication of land does not meet the standards set forth in subsection (b), the subdivider shall pay a fee in lieu of land dedication. The fee amount shall be determined in accordance with section 17-105. 
(e)  Land dedication and fee in lieu of dedication. The subdivider may both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu of dedication when land suitable for dedication is smaller than that required by section 17-104. 
(f)  Improvements to dedicated parkland. If the subdivider proposes to provide improvements and equipment on dedicated land, the proposed improvements and equipment shall be consistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan, the City of Belmont Park and Open Space Master Plan, and any other applicable adopted standards. If the approving body for the tentative map or tentative parcel map approves the improvements and equipment, the value of the improvements and equipment shall be determined by the park and recreation director, and the value of the improvements and equipment shall be a credit against the dedication of land or payment of fees otherwise required by this article. 
(g)  Credit for private recreational facilities. A credit may be granted for private recreational facilities provided within common interest developments, as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, against required land dedications or in lieu fees if all of the following standards are met: 
(1)  The private facilities are consistent with the all of the standards for mini-parks, neighborhood parks, or community parks contained in the City of Belmont Park and Open Space Master Plan. 
(2)  The private facilities are open to the public. 
(3)  The use of the private facilities is restricted to park and recreation purposes and their private ownership and maintenance are assured by recorded covenants that run with the land and cannot be eliminated without the consent of the city. 
(4)  Credit granted for private recreational facilities shall be from zero percent to twenty (20) percent of the amount of required land dedication or in lieu fee imposed by this article. In no case shall credit exceed twenty (20) percent. The amount of credit shall be determined based on the degree to which the private facilities complement existing or proposed public facilities serving the subdivision, as shown in the City of Belmont Park and Open Space Master Plan; and the degree to which the private facilities reduce the burden on existing or proposed public park facilities serving the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 2014-1082 , § 3, 11-25-14) 
Sec. 17-108. - Implementation. 
(a)  At the time of filing the final map or parcel map for recordation, the subdivider must offer to dedicate any land as required, pay any required in-lieu fee, and provide improvement agreements and security for improvement of parkland for which the subdivider is receiving a credit. 
(b)  The city council will accept, accept subject to improvement, or reject the offer of dedication at the time of map approval. 
(c)  The subdivider must coordinate any required improvements to public or private park and recreational facilities with the development of the subdivision to assure the availability of recreational facilities to serve the residents of the area.

(a)  Pretreatment of wastes or wastewater shall be furnished by every user on the user's premises when such waste or wastewater, prior to pretreatment, does not comply with the minimum acceptable requirements and criteria therefor for discharge into the sewerage facilities as set forth in division 4 of this article. Such pretreatment facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense, and shall be of sufficient design and capacity to pretreat waste or wastewater discharged from the premises into the sewerage facilities to a level meeting such minimum requirements, and such other requirements established by the director and reasonably necessary or appropriate for the sewerage facilities to treat adequately such waste or wastewater under normal operating and treatment conditions. 
(b)  Prior to the installation of such pretreatment' facilities, plans and specifications therefor shall be submitted to the director, together with such data and descriptive material relating to the waste or wastewater prior to, and after such proposed pretreatment as the director may require, in order that the director may ascertain the wastewater constituents and characteristics and volume of the wastewater discharge after pretreatment. The user shall make such modifications, changes or amendments to said plans and specifications as the director may reasonably require in order that the provisions of this article, or any permit issued, or to be issued pursuant to this article, shall be complied with. Upon approval of such plans and specifications by the director, the user may proceed with the construction thereof; provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed to waive or modify any other requirement of this article, or of any permit issued pursuant to this article, or of any other requirements of law. 
(c)  Approval of plans and specifications of pretreatment facilities pursuant to this section shall not relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such pretreatment facilities as necessary to produce effluent therefrom complying with all pertinent provisions of this article, or any permit issued pursuant to this article, or any other requirements of law. Any proposed cessation of use, or alteration, modification, or other change to approved pretreatment facilities or any portion thereof, or any changes in method of operation thereof, shall be reported to the director prior to commencement thereof, and shall be subject to the approval of the director. Such approval may be withheld, granted, or granted subject to such terms, conditions, or requirements as the director may reasonably require in order to insure compliance with the provisions of this article, or any permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this article.

Such security shall consist of an irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, or performance bond as determined by the director. The security shall be provided in the manner required by the director and maintained in full force and effect until the permitted work in the public right-of-way is completed to the satisfaction of the director, at which time the amount of the security shall be reduced to ten (10) percent of the actual cost of the work. The reduced security shall be maintained by licensee for a period of one (1) year as a guarantee that the work is of good quality and free from any defective or faulty material or workmanship. Any surety supplying a performance bond must be an "admitted surety insurer," as defined in Section 995.120 of the Code of Civil Procedure, authorized to do business in the State of California. Return of the security shall be conditioned upon licensee's faithful performance of all work in the public right-of-way specified in the applicable permit. In the event licensee fails to comply with any provisions of this article related to such work, or any provision of any applicable right-of-way agreement or permit, or other approval related to such work, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result thereof shall be recoverable from the security, including but not limited to the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, cost of removal, or abandonment of any property of licensee, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs up to the full amount of the security. 
(b)  Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by the city hereunder shall be construed to excuse licensee's faithful performance of any right-of-way agreement or limit the liability or damages of licensee under this article, either to the full amount of the security or otherwise. In addition to its rights to take action under the security, the city may pursue any other remedy provided by law.

(Ord. No. 960, § 1, 4-10-01) 
Sec. 22-103. - Transfer of agreement or facilities.

A sale or transfer of stock, assets, or other equitable interests of licensee, or any parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of licensee, which effects a material change in licensee's ownership or control, as determined by the city, shall be deemed to be a transfer for purposes of this section. Any transfer shall be made only by an instrument in writing, such as a bill of sale, or similar document, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the city clerk within thirty (30) days after any such transfer or assignment. The consent of the city council to a transfer may not be unreasonably denied. Any proposed transferee must show that it has the financial, technical and legal ability to perform all obligations and requirements of the right-of-way agreement and this article as determined by the city council and must agree in writing to comply with all provisions of the right-of-way agreement and this article. No consent by the city shall be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure any indebtedness. 
(Ord. No. 960, § 1, 4-10-01) 
Sec. 22-104. - Nonexclusive use; limitations. 
(a)  Any right-of-way agreement shall be for the nonexclusive use of the public rights-of-way.

(b)  A right-of-way agreement only authorizes licensee to use the public right-of-way specifically described in one or more encroachment permits issued by the city, and the use of any other public property, whether located within or outside a public right-of-way, is strictly prohibited unless authorized by a separate agreement with the city. 
(c)  No reference herein, nor in any right-of-way agreement, shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its interest or other right to control the use of the property that is the subject of a right-of-way agreement is sufficient to permit its use for the purposes specified in the agreement. Any right-of-way agreement shall be deemed to grant no more than the rights which the city may have the authority to grant. 
(d)  Any privilege claimed by licensee in any public right-of-way shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy or use of the public right-of-way. 
(e)  Licensee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this article or of any right-of-way agreement executed under this article or because of its enforcement.

(c)  Neither the execution of a right-of-way agreement nor any provisions of this article shall constitute a waiver or bar the exercise of any governmental right or power of the city, including the city's authority to make any proper public use of the public right-of-way. 
(d)  The city council and the director may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise: of the city's jurisdiction under this article.

(Code 1961, § 29.1) 
Sec. 23-64. - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this article: 
    Hotel means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. "Hotel" does not mean any of the following: Any hospital, sanitarium, medical clinic, convalescent home, rest home, home for aged people, foster home, or other similar facility operated for the care or treatment of human beings; any asylum, jail, prison, orphanage or other facility in which human beings are detained and housed under legal restraint, any housing owned or controlled by any educational institution and used exclusively to house students, faculty or other employees, and any fraternity or sorority house or similar facility occupied exclusively by students and employees of such educational institution, and officially recognized or approved by it; any housing operated or used exclusively for religious, charitable or educational purposes by any organization having qualifications for exemption from property taxes under the laws of California; any housing owned by a governmental agency and used to house its employees or for governmental purposes; any camp as defined in the Labor Code or other housing furnished by an employer exclusively for employees. 
    Occupancy means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
    Operator means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this article by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

    Rent means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
    Rental agent means any person other than an operator, who collects rent from a transient for the transient's occupancy of a hotel. 
    Tax administrator means the collector of the city. 
    Transient means any individual who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy of a specific room by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing providing for a longer period of occupancy of the room. In determining whether an individual is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to April 26, 1967, may be considered. 
(Code 1961, § 29.2; Ord. No. 642, § 1, 1-22-79; Ord. No. 2019-1137 , § 1, 1-22-19)

Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city or to a rental agent in accordance with Section 23-83. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator.

(Code 1961, § 29.4) 
Sec. 23-67. - Collection; advertising that payment not required prohibited.

No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.

Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
(a)  The name of the operator; 
(b)  The address of the hotel; 
(c)  The date upon which the certificate was issued;

This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
    There shall be no fee for such certificate. 
(Code 1961, § 29.6) 
Sec. 23-69. - Reports and remittances. 
    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies for that calendar quarter or reporting period. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this article shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator.

(c)  If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this article is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five (25) per cent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(d)  In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this article shall pay interest at the rate of one per cent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
(e)  Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Code 1961, § 29.8) 
Sec. 23-71. - Imposition of lien. 
    If any amount required to be paid to the city under this article is not paid when due, the tax administrator, may within three (3) years after the amount is due file for record in the office of the San Mateo County recorder a certificate specifying the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the operator liable for the same and the fact that the tax administrator has complied with all provisions of this article in the determination of the amount required to be paid. From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be paid together with penalties and interest constitutes a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the operator or afterwards and before the lien expires acquired by him. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten (10) years from the time of filing of the certificate unless sooner released or otherwise discharged. 
(Code 1961, § 29.8) 
Sec. 23-72. - Priority of lien. 
    The amounts required to be paid by any operator under this article with penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases:

(b)  Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his assets. 
(c)  Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of executors, administrators, or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased. 
(d)  Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay any amount under this article are levied upon by process of law. 
    This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien. 
    The preference given to the city by this article shall be subordinate to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Sections 1204 and 1206 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
(Code 1961, § 29.8) 
Sec. 23-73. - Warrant for collection. 
    At any time within three (3) years after any operator is delinquent in the payment of any amount herein required to be paid or within three (3) years after the last recording of a certificate of lien under Section 6011(b), the tax administrator may issue a warrant for the enforcement of any liens and for the collection of any amount required to be paid to the city under this chapter. The warrant shall be directed to any sheriff, marshal or constable and shall have the same effect as a writ of execution. The warrant shall be levied and sale made pursuant to it in the same manner and with the same effect as a levy of and a sale pursuant to a writ of execution. The tax administrator may pay or advance to the sheriff, marshal or constable, the same fees, commissions and expenses for his services as are provided by law for similar services pursuant to a writ of execution.

(Code 1961, § 29.8) 
Sec. 23-75. - Successor to withhold part of purchase price. 
    If any operator liable for any amount under this article sells out his business or quits the business, his successor or assignee shall withhold enough of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that it has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. 
(Code 1961, § 29.8) 
Sec. 23-76. - Liability of purchaser; release therefrom.

If the administrator assesses unremitted taxes and penalties against the rental agent, the rental agent shall be subject to the provisions of sections 23-77, 23-82, 23-79, and 23-80 as if it were an operator. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the administrator from assessing the full amount of any unremitted taxes and penalties solely against the operator in lieu of assessing some or all of those taxes and penalties against the rental agent.

Chapter 25.5 - WATER CONSERVATION[1] 
Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 687, § 1, adopted Feb. 10, 1981, added. Ch. 29, §§ 29-1-29-13. In order to maintain the alphabetical sequence of chapters, the editor has redesignated the provisions as Ch. 25.5. For convenience' sake, the history note will include the section number as originally promulgated as Ch. 29. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 25.5-1. - Purpose. 
    This chapter is intended to promote reasonable conservation of water in the County of San Mateo consistent with maintaining a comfortable standard of living and a healthy economy. It provides a framework for the orderly and timely implementation of reasonable water conservation measures by the different elements of the county's economy. This chapter also carries out certain provisions of the Water Code of the State of California as embodied in article XIV, section 3 of the Constitution of the State of California, which states that maximum beneficial use of the water resources of the state is necessary to prevent the waste or unreasonable use, or unreasonable method of use, of water. This chapter further implements the provisions of the conservation element of the Comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan for San Mateo County as adopted on June 20, 1978. 
    It is recognized that stricter water conservation measures may be necessary during a future drought or water shortage emergency. Such further measures should not penalize water users for past conservation practices, nor should implementation of water conservation measures constitute a new basis to determine future reductions in case of a declared water shortage emergency. No provision in this chapter is intended to supersede any rule or regulation of the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California.

Secs. 31-5-31-9. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - POLYSTYRENE FOOD SERVICE WARE 

Sec. 31-10. - Findings. 
    The city council finds that: 
(a)  Polystyrene is a petroleum-based, lightweight plastic material commonly used as food service ware by retail food vendors operating in the City of Belmont. Polystyrene, often referred to by the trademark Styrofoam, has also become a problematic environmental pollutant given its non-biodegradable, and nearly non-reusable nature. 
(b)  Polystyrene-based, single-use food service ware constitutes a substantial portion of the litter found on streets, streams, creeks, and in the City of Belmont's storm drain system. 
(c)  Effective ways to reduce the negative environmental impacts of disposable food service ware include reusing or recycling food service ware and using compostable materials made from renewable resources such as paper, cardboard, corn starch, potato starch, or sugarcane. 
(d)  The use of polystyrene-based disposable food service ware by food vendors should be restricted. 
(e)  The County of San Mateo has adopted an ordinance prohibiting food vendors from using polystyrene based disposable food service ware. Section 4.107.080 of the County's Ordinance Code authorizes the county environmental health division to enforce the prohibition in the incorporated areas of the county if a city adopts San Mateo County Ordinance Code Title 4, Chapter 4.107, by reference and authorizes the environmental health division to enforce the code. 
(f)  Adoption of San Mateo County Ordinance Code Title 4, Chapter 4.107, by the City of Belmont will reduce the amount of polystyrene litter on city streets and sidewalks, and in storm drains and creeks, and reduce the amount of non-reusable, non-biodegradable waste generated in the City of Belmont.

for new land division shall comply with the maximum allowed residential dwelling unit
density and minimum lot sizes computed in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Slope/Density Tables in this Section. The maximum allowable densities and the
minimum allowable lot sizes shall be based upon net land area (after subtracting public
street rights of way and vehicular access easements). Lot slope shall be calculated using
the formula from the definitions section of Ordinance 360 and lot slopes ending in ½%
or more shall be rounded to the next highest whole number. Each lot created by
subdivision, or any remainder parcel associated with a subdivision, shall individually
meet the minimum lot size standard based upon that lot's particular slope. The
allowable density indicated, however, does not preclude the hearing body from
determining that a lower density, or larger lots, from that indicated is required to meet
the purpose of this ordinance and the goals and policies of the General Plan.4

(iii) Assist in providing required off-street garage parking (for existing residences that currently have substandard parking).
(B) The granting of the exception will not result in a substantial adverse impact to the views or privacy of adjacent property owners.
(C) The granting of the exception will not result in significant bulk for a new building or a significant increase in building bulk for an existing building.
(3) Criteria For Substantial Adverse Impact to Views or Privacy. The following criteria shall be used by the reviewing authority to determine whether a Floor Area Exception will have a substantial adverse impact on views or privacy:
(A) Private views. A private view is an unobstructed view from a bedroom, common area, or amenity area (deck, patio, etc.) to a prominent natural feature or landmark (i.e., the San Francisco Bay or undeveloped ridgelines). A substantial adverse impact may be determined based on:
(i) Where the view originates (which room or amenity area);
(ii) The relative value of other views that occur on site;
(iii) The quality of the natural feature or landmark in the view;
(iv) How much of the view is obstructed.
(B) Privacy. A substantial adverse privacy impact may be determined based on:
(i) Setbacks/Additional Setbacks;
(ii) Topography;
(iii) Window design;
(iv) Window to window alignment;
(v) Vegetation;
(vi) Location of decks, balconies, pools, and other amenity areas;
(vii) Buffer strips and fencing;
(viii) Location of parking and access ways;
(ix) Location of entries and paths of travel;
(x) Lighting.
(4) Standard for Review of Building/Addition Location. As much as practical, the resulting new construction would be located to avoid or reduce bulk, privacy and private view impacts to adjacent properties.

4.7 HILLSIDE RESIDENTIAL AND OPEN SPACE (HRO) DISTRICTS (note: HRO-1
applies to unsubdivided, HRO-2 applies to subdivided).45
4.7.1 PURPOSE - The City Council finds and declares that certain areas of the City provide
unique terrain features and add substantially to the character of the area, that the location
and visibility of development therein will affect the visual quality of the environment, and
that hillside development should preserve the natural terrain while providing a density of
residential development compatible with the limitations of slope on the development site.
The Council further finds that there are geologic and soils hazards in the area, steep slopes,
and inadequate roadways making it necessary to reduce density in portions of the San Juan
Hills Area to protect the public safety and to reduce significant and cumulative traffic
impacts to the Ralston Avenue corridor. The objectives of this chapter's regulations are to
encourage minimal grading and to reduce citizens' exposure to hazardous slopes by
decreasing residential density as slope increases, to encourage clustering of homes and
density transfer to reduce roadway and driveway grading, to regulate home size, and to
encourage the voluntary merger of lots.

5A.2 COMMUNITY BENEFIT BONUSES
5A.2.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY. To provide an incentive for development, in partnership with the City, to provide community benefits that would not otherwise be created, the City Council may grant increased FAR, density or height in return for provision of specific community benefits, as listed below or subsequently identified by the City Council, if doing so is in the Citys interest and will help implement the General Plan, and these benefits cannot be realized without granting increased FAR, height, and/or density.
5A.2.2 BONUSES AVAILABLE
(a) For Lot Consolidation. In order to promote the consolidation of small lots into larger
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
5A-5
sites, which are better able to accommodate mixed use development and thus confer community benefits, the City Council may approve an increase in the maximum allowable base FAR up to 10 percent if such an increase is needed to ensure development feasibility based on an independent, third-party appraisal. This additional FAR may be combined with additional FAR earned for other community benefits listed in paragraph (b) below.
(b) For Other Community Benefits. Increased FAR, height, and density up to the maximums with community benefits listed in Section 5A.1.6, 5A.1.7 and 5A.1.11 may be approved by the City Council for the following community benefits:
(1) On-site affordable housing in an amount exceeding the Citys requirements for inclusionary housing established in the Zoning Ordinance.
(2) Public access easements, wider sidewalks, and additional public right-of-way provided where identified in the General Plan.
(3) Public right-of-way improvements, which are in addition to those required to serve new development.
(4) Art in public places, including art in privately-owned publicly accessible plazas and courtyards.
(5) Privately owned publicly accessible open space exceeding the minimum requirements of this Ordinance, and consistent with the general types and locations of desired public parks and plazas identified in the General Plan.
(6) Below-market rental rates guaranteed for a minimum of ten years for a day care center, cultural facility or incubator space for qualifying small businesses.
(7) Retention or construction of retail or office commercial development within the CMU Corridor Mixed Use District.
(8) Contributions to a Council-administered Community Fund or Community Recreation Fund, if one is created.
(9) Community recreational facilities, such as an ice rink.
(10) Any other community benefit, as determined by the City Council after a duly-noticed public hearing, to be significant, substantial and essential for Specific Plan implementation and which would not otherwise be provided if increased FAR, height or density is not approved.
5A.2.3 PROCEDURES FOR AWARDING BONUSES; FINDINGS REQUIRED - After conducting a duly-noted public hearing, the City Council may grant increased FAR, density or height, as requested by the applicant or as modified by the Council, in return for provision of specific community benefits if the City Council determines that (1) making such an award is in the Citys interest and will help implement the General Plan, (2) these benefits cannot be realized without granting increased FAR, height, and/or density, and (3) that the increase granted is the minimum necessary to realize these benefits and no adverse impacts or land use incompatibilities will be created that are judged unacceptable. The
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
5A-6
decision to grant increased FAR, density or height is discretionary, and the Council is not obligated to grant any increase if any of these required findings cannot be made.
5A.2.4 MODIFICATIONS AND CHANGED PLANS
(a) Minor Modifications. The Community Development Director may approve minor modifications, not to exceed 10 percent of any dimensional requirement or standard, to an approved project that are consistent with the original findings and conditions approved by the review authority and would result in the same or substantially similar community benefits.
(b) Changed Plans. A proposed change in an approved project subject to the requirements of this section that would result in a change of more than 10 percent increase in any dimensional requirement or standard trips must be accompanied by a statement of what modifications or additions to the approved community benefits will be made to ensure the City derives the same or substantially similar benefits. The Planning Commission may conditionally approve such a change, subject to annual monitoring, after holding a duly-noticed public hearing and confirming that the community benefit programs objectives are being met.
5A.2.5 IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING - A report documenting the community benefits realized under this program or an affidavit confirming that the requirements of this section have been met must be submitted to the Community Development Director within one year of project approval. If the approved community benefits consist of solely physical development or measures that would be performed once, this report must be submitted once. For measures that are ongoing commitments, this report must be submitted annually. If the annual report shows compliance for three consecutive years, no further annual reports are required. A five-year review may be required by the Director to evaluate the overall effectiveness of all community benefits derived from this program and may suggest new or modified benefits for the Councils consideration.

City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-2
occupants of the property, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to non-occupants, or otherwise made publicly accessible with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on 30 days notice if they become needed by occupants of the property.
(b) Separate Parking and Loading Spaces. No area may be utilized and counted both as a required parking space and a required loading space. However, maneuvering aisles and driveways may serve both required parking spaces and loading spaces if they meet the requirements specified in this Section for both parking and loading facilities.
(c) Parking for Disabled Persons. The number, design, designation, and location of Disabled Person Parking spaces must comply with State law. Such spaces will be counted towards the parking requirements of this section.
(d) Nonconforming Parking Facilities. Existing land uses with off-street parking and loading facilities that do not conform to the requirements of this section may be enlarged or expanded, provided that an in-lieu parking fee is paid, if established, or additional parking and loading facilities are added, either on-site or off-site, so that the parking needs for the enlarged or expanded portion of the building are met. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the Planning Commission for small sites and projects determined by the Commission to provide community benefits.
(e) Unbundled Parking. The following rules will apply as conditions of approval to the rental of parking spaces in new Multi-Unit Residential buildings with ten or more rental units. The Community Development Director may grant an exception from the requirements of this subsection for affordable rental units that include financing for affordable housing that requires that costs for parking and housing be bundled together.
(1) All off-street parking spaces that are beyond a base allowance of one per unit must be rented separately from the rental fees for dwelling units for the life of the dwelling units, such that potential renters have the option of renting a residential unit with only one parking space at a price lower than would be the case if there were a single price for both the residential unit and all of the parking space(s).
(2) In cases where there are fewer parking spaces than dwelling units, the parking spaces shall be offered first to the potential renters of three bedroom or more units, second to potential renters of two bedroom units, and then to potential renters of other units.
(3) Potential renters of affordable units shall have an equal opportunity to rent a parking space on the same terms and conditions as offered to potential renters of market-rate units, at a price proportional to the rent of their units as compared to comparable market-rate units. This stipulation shall be included in any agreement recorded between the City and developer pertaining to the affordable housing units pursuant to Section 29 (Affordable Housing).
(4) Parking spaces shall be offered only to residents of the dwelling units served by the off-street parking, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to non-residents, or otherwise made available for public use, with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on 30 days notice if they are needed by residents. Required visitor spaces shall not be rented out, but may be made available for public use.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-3
(f) Garages/Carports/Uncovered Residential Parking. For residential uses, required off-street parking located in the front half of a lot or within 25 feet of the side street on a corner lot shall be covered with carport, garage or roofed structure except as allowed below. Uncovered off-street parking may be located in the rear half of the lot when more than 25 feet from a side street.
(g) Surface Parking Lots. Surface parking lots shall be subject to the following restrictions and standards. The area of a surface parking lot shall include all features within the lots outer edges, including all parking spaces, maneuvering aisles, access driveways, and perimeter and interior landscaping, walkways, and other features.
(1) Large Parking Lots. If on-site parking for more than 50 spaces is needed, such parking facilities shall be designed to have exceptional landscaping or design features, shall be located such that it is not highly visible from public rights-of-way, shall be provided within buildings or parking structures or in separate lots that are each less than two acres in size, or shall be otherwise covered by a structure that serves a non-parking function, such as solar panels, recreational facilities, roof deck, or green roof.
(2) Pedestrian Circulation. Parking lots containing 25 or more spaces shall have walkways separated from motor vehicle maneuvering aisles and driveways connecting the principal building or buildings served by the lot to the farthest point of the lot from the main pedestrian entrance of such building or buildings. (A) Materials and Width. Walkways shall provide at least four feet of unobstructed width and be hard-surfaced. (B) Identification. Pedestrian walkways shall be clearly differentiated from driveways, parking aisles, and parking and loading spaces through the use of elevation changes, curb separation, different paving material, or similar method. (C) Separation. Where a pedestrian walkway is parallel and adjacent to an auto travel lane, it must be raised and separated from the travel lane by a raised curb at least six inches high, bollards, or other physical barrier.
8A.2.2 CALCULATION OF REQUIRED SPACES
(a) Fractions: If the calculation of required parking or loading spaces results in the requirement of a fractional space, such fraction, if one-half (0.5) or greater, shall be considered one additional space; if the fraction is less than one-half (0.5), it shall result in no additional spaces.
(b) Multiple Uses. When two or more principal uses are located on the same lot, the estimated peak period parking demand shall be the sum of the estimated demand of the various individual uses during the period of peak combined demand for all uses, as determined through a parking study prepared by a qualified individual or firm.
(c) Area-Based Estimates. All area-based estimated peak period parking demands shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area, excluding parking and loading areas.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-4
(d) Exclusion of First 2,500 Square Feet. For all nonresidential uses with area-based estimated peak period parking demands, the first 2,500 square feet of retail or restaurant use shall be subtracted from the gross square footage of the use when calculating the estimated parking demand.
(e) Motorcycle Parking. There shall be a credit of one automobile parking space for every four motorcycle parking spaces provided, not to exceed five percent of the total number of automobile parking spaces required. Motorcycle parking spaces shall be no less than four feet wide by eight feet long with an aisle width of no less than 10 feet and shall be clearly marked.
(f) Minimum Parking Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no less than the minimum number of parking spaces, as required by Table 8A.2-1, shall be provided for each use or site.
(g) Maximum Private Parking Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no more than the maximum number of private, off-street parking spaces, as specified in 8A.2-1, shall be provided for each use or site.
(1) Excess Parking to be Shared. Off-street parking spaces may be provided in excess of the maximum number of spaces specified in Table 8A.2-1, provided that all such excess spaces are designed and operated to be shared and publicly accessible parking spaces available for public use at any time, except for uses with safety concerns which the Director confirms are valid and justify not sharing the spaces. Property owners may charge an hourly, daily, or monthly fee for use of any such public access parking provided in excess of the maximum off-street parking limits of this subsection.
(h) Parking Spaces Below the Minimum or Above the Maximum. Parking spaces less than the required minimum or more than the allowed maximum may be provided upon the granting of a conditional use permit as set forth below.
(1) Parking Spaces Less Than the Minimum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide less than the minimum number of parking spaces required by Table 8A.2-1, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings otherwise required for a conditional use permit: (A) That adequate measures will be put in place through a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program, as required by Section 31.7 to reduce parking demand, such as promoting use of public transit, bicycling, and walking, and allowing modified working hours and telecommuting; and (B) That the reduction or elimination of the required parking spaces will not substantially reduce the availability of on-street parking for the occupants of nearby commercial and, or residential buildings.
(2) Parking Spaces More Than the Maximum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide more than the maximum number of private parking spaces allowed by Table 8A.2-1, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required for a conditional use permit:
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-5
(A) That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the additional parking is required to meet the anticipated parking demand of the proposed uses; and (B) That the provision of the additional parking will not result in an overdependence on automobiles and will not adversely affect transit, bicycle, or pedestrian access to the site or other adjacent uses.
8A2.3 DESIGN STANDARDS - The parking area design standards of this section apply to all off-street parking areas in the CMU and RC zoning districts. All required parking spaces and associated maneuvering aisles, driveways, and other related features shall be designed and arranged so as to provide motor vehicles with adequate ingress to and egress from all required parking spaces, and to provide pedestrians with adequate access to parked vehicles.
(a) Parking Layout and Dimensions. The layout and dimensions of off-street parking facilities shall be as set forth in Figure 8A.3-1 and Table 8A.3-1, as further provided below.
(1) Regulatory and Calculated Dimensions. Stall width, stall length, and aisle width, as shown in Table 8A.3-1, are regulatory. Other dimensions shown in Table 8A.3-1 are calculated from these required dimensions, and are provided for convenience.
(2) Stall Width and Length. As indicated in Table 8A.3-1, the required minimum stall width and length for various parking angles are as set forth below. Compact spaces with an eight-foot width and 16-foot length are permitted for up to 33 percent of the required spaces. (A) Width. For parking angles of more than 30 degrees the required minimum stall width is eight feet six inches. For parking angles of 30 degrees or less, the required minimum stall width is eight feet. (B) Length. For all parking angles other than parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is 18 feet. For parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is 20 feet.
(3) Aisle Width for Parking Angles Not Shown. For parking angles not shown in Table 8A.3-1, the required aisle width shall be interpolated from the values in the table. For example, for a parking angle of 70 degrees, which is two-thirds of the increment between 60 degrees and 75 degrees, the required one-way aisle width is 18 feet eight inches, which is two-thirds of the increment between the required aisle widths for 60-degree parking and 75-degree parking, 16 feet and 20 feet respectively.
(4) Alternate Maneuvering Aisle and Parking Space Widths. For parking angles equal to or greater than 45 degrees and less than 90 degrees, one-way aisle width may be decreased by three inches for each one-inch increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches. For 90-degree parking, one-way and two-way aisle width may be decreased by three inches for each one-inch increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches and a minimum aisle width of twenty-two feet.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-6
(5) Two-Way Modules. Table 8A.3-1 provides the dimensions for parking modules with one-way traffic. For parking modules with two-way traffic, add the difference in width between a two-way aisle and a one-way aisle. For example, for a two-way module with a parking angle of 45-degrees, add eight feet, which is the difference between a two-way aisle (20 feet) and a one-way aisle (12 feet).
(6) Overhang. Parking stall lengths, except for parallel spaces, may be reduced by two feet where the parking stall is designed to abut a landscaped area a minimum of five feet wide, such that the front of the vehicle can overhang the landscaped area.
(7) Spaces Abutting Walls or Posts. For each side of a parking space abutting a wall or post, an additional foot of width shall be required.

8A.5.10 LIGHTING - All exterior loading spaces and the maneuvering areas and driveways serving them shall be provided with lighting meeting the minimums established for parking areas.
8A.6 ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE WITH PARKING REQUIREMENTS
8A.6.1 ALTERNATIVE PARKING AND LOADING PLAN - Where an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that variations in the standards or dimensions otherwise required by this section are warranted for uses with unique needs, an alternative parking area design and loading plan may be allowed with approval of a conditional use permit. To grant such a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission must make all of the following findings in addition to the findings otherwise required:
(a) That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the alternative plan is a superior solution and the requested modifications in the design standards are warranted; and
(b) That the alternative parking arrangement will be in place at all times during operation of the principal uses to be served by the parking.
8A.6.2 VALET PARKING - Valet parking may be permitted as a means of satisfying all or a portion of the off-street parking requirement. Valet parking may be used to accommodate more parking spaces on the site of the principal use served by the parking than could be accommodated in conformance with the design standards of this section. It may also be used to provide off-site parking. No valet parking shall cause interference with the public use of rights-of-way or imperil public safety.
8A.6.3 ACCESS AND PARKING IN-LIEU FEES - As an alternative to providing off-street parking on-site or off-site, project applicants may elect to pay a fee in-lieu to fund public
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-19
access and parking improvements for all or a portion of the required spaces. This optional Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee is intended to enable the City to (1) acquire sites for and develop off-street public parking, or to lease unused, or underutilized private parking for public use to accommodate auto access and vehicle storage demand that cannot be addressed either on site, or on-street in the vicinity of the project, or (2) to fund transportation demand management programs and services, and/or public transportation, bicycle, and/or pedestrian facilities and services, as necessary to accommodate an equivalent number of person trips to the site. The fee shall be established by the City Council and administered by the Director on a per vehicle trip basis, such that the developer of a nonresidential project contributes toward the provision of parking and/or non-auto facilities and services accommodating the same number of person trips to the site as would have been accommodated by the provision of the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required by this section, as adjusted by other provisions of this section. The Director shall determine the vehicle trip generation rate for each land use or site seeking to use the Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee option with reference to the vehicle trip generation rates published in the latest edition of the Institute for Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, with adjustments for mixing of uses, density of population and employment, and proximity to frequent transit service. An Access and Parking in-lieu fee shall be provided for nonresidential uses only as follows:
(a) Parking In-Lieu Fee Amount. The amount of the parking in-lieu fee shall be as set forth in the Citys Master Fee Schedule and, for projects that would otherwise have to provide 20 or more spaces, the Director shall have the right to determine whether to accept payment of the fee for all or only a portion of the required parking.
(b) Deposit of Funds. Parking in-lieu fees shall be deposited with the City prior to issuance of a building permit in a separate fund to be known as the Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee Fund and shall be used only as described in this section.
(c) Refund of Fee. A parking in-lieu fee may be refunded, without interest, to the person who made such payment, or his or her assignee or designee, if additional off-street parking spaces are provided for such building or use by others than the City, so as to satisfy the parking requirement for which the in-lieu payment was made. To obtain a refund, the required off-street parking spaces must be in place prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy and before funds are spent or committed by the City.
8A.7 TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT

8A-2
occupants of the property, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to non-occupants, or otherwise made publicly accessible with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on 30 days notice if they become needed by occupants of the property.
(b) Separate Parking and Loading Spaces. No area may be utilized and counted both as a required parking space and a required loading space. However, maneuvering aisles and driveways may serve both required parking spaces and loading spaces if they meet the requirements specified in this Section for both parking and loading facilities.
(c) Parking for Disabled Persons. The number, design, designation, and location of Disabled Person Parking spaces must comply with State law. Such spaces will be counted towards the parking requirements of this section.
(d) Nonconforming Parking Facilities. Existing land uses with off-street parking and loading facilities that do not conform to the requirements of this section may be enlarged or expanded, provided that an in-lieu parking fee is paid, if established, or additional parking and loading facilities are added, either on-site or off-site, so that the parking needs for the enlarged or expanded portion of the building are met. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the Planning Commission for small sites and projects determined by the Commission to provide community benefits.
(e) Unbundled Parking. The following rules will apply as conditions of approval to the rental of parking spaces in new Multi-Unit Residential buildings with ten or more rental units. The Community Development Director may grant an exception from the requirements of this subsection for affordable rental units that include financing for affordable housing that requires that costs for parking and housing be bundled together.
(1) All off-street parking spaces that are beyond a base allowance of one per unit must be rented separately from the rental fees for dwelling units for the life of the dwelling units, such that potential renters have the option of renting a residential unit with only one parking space at a price lower than would be the case if there were a single price for both the residential unit and all of the parking space(s).
(2) In cases where there are fewer parking spaces than dwelling units, the parking spaces shall be offered first to the potential renters of three bedroom or more units, second to potential renters of two bedroom units, and then to potential renters of other units.
(3) Potential renters of affordable units shall have an equal opportunity to rent a parking space on the same terms and conditions as offered to potential renters of market-rate units, at a price proportional to the rent of their units as compared to comparable market-rate units. This stipulation shall be included in any agreement recorded between the City and developer pertaining to the affordable housing units pursuant to Section 29 (Affordable Housing).
(4) Parking spaces shall be offered only to residents of the dwelling units served by the off-street parking, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to non-residents, or otherwise made available for public use, with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on 30 days notice if they are needed by residents. Required visitor spaces shall not be rented out, but may be made available for public use.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-3
(f) Garages/Carports/Uncovered Residential Parking. For residential uses, required off-street parking located in the front half of a lot or within 25 feet of the side street on a corner lot shall be covered with carport, garage or roofed structure except as allowed below. Uncovered off-street parking may be located in the rear half of the lot when more than 25 feet from a side street.
(g) Surface Parking Lots. Surface parking lots shall be subject to the following restrictions and standards. The area of a surface parking lot shall include all features within the lots outer edges, including all parking spaces, maneuvering aisles, access driveways, and perimeter and interior landscaping, walkways, and other features.
(1) Large Parking Lots. If on-site parking for more than 50 spaces is needed, such parking facilities shall be designed to have exceptional landscaping or design features, shall be located such that it is not highly visible from public rights-of-way, shall be provided within buildings or parking structures or in separate lots that are each less than two acres in size, or shall be otherwise covered by a structure that serves a non-parking function, such as solar panels, recreational facilities, roof deck, or green roof.
(2) Pedestrian Circulation. Parking lots containing 25 or more spaces shall have walkways separated from motor vehicle maneuvering aisles and driveways connecting the principal building or buildings served by the lot to the farthest point of the lot from the main pedestrian entrance of such building or buildings. (A) Materials and Width. Walkways shall provide at least four feet of unobstructed width and be hard-surfaced. (B) Identification. Pedestrian walkways shall be clearly differentiated from driveways, parking aisles, and parking and loading spaces through the use of elevation changes, curb separation, different paving material, or similar method. (C) Separation. Where a pedestrian walkway is parallel and adjacent to an auto travel lane, it must be raised and separated from the travel lane by a raised curb at least six inches high, bollards, or other physical barrier.
8A.2.2 CALCULATION OF REQUIRED SPACES
(a) Fractions: If the calculation of required parking or loading spaces results in the requirement of a fractional space, such fraction, if one-half (0.5) or greater, shall be considered one additional space; if the fraction is less than one-half (0.5), it shall result in no additional spaces.
(b) Multiple Uses. When two or more principal uses are located on the same lot, the estimated peak period parking demand shall be the sum of the estimated demand of the various individual uses during the period of peak combined demand for all uses, as determined through a parking study prepared by a qualified individual or firm.
(c) Area-Based Estimates. All area-based estimated peak period parking demands shall be computed on the basis of gross floor area, excluding parking and loading areas.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-4
(d) Exclusion of First 2,500 Square Feet. For all nonresidential uses with area-based estimated peak period parking demands, the first 2,500 square feet of retail or restaurant use shall be subtracted from the gross square footage of the use when calculating the estimated parking demand.
(e) Motorcycle Parking. There shall be a credit of one automobile parking space for every four motorcycle parking spaces provided, not to exceed five percent of the total number of automobile parking spaces required. Motorcycle parking spaces shall be no less than four feet wide by eight feet long with an aisle width of no less than 10 feet and shall be clearly marked.
(f) Minimum Parking Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no less than the minimum number of parking spaces, as required by Table 8A.2-1, shall be provided for each use or site.
(g) Maximum Private Parking Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no more than the maximum number of private, off-street parking spaces, as specified in 8A.2-1, shall be provided for each use or site.
(1) Excess Parking to be Shared. Off-street parking spaces may be provided in excess of the maximum number of spaces specified in Table 8A.2-1, provided that all such excess spaces are designed and operated to be shared and publicly accessible parking spaces available for public use at any time, except for uses with safety concerns which the Director confirms are valid and justify not sharing the spaces. Property owners may charge an hourly, daily, or monthly fee for use of any such public access parking provided in excess of the maximum off-street parking limits of this subsection.
(h) Parking Spaces Below the Minimum or Above the Maximum. Parking spaces less than the required minimum or more than the allowed maximum may be provided upon the granting of a conditional use permit as set forth below.
(1) Parking Spaces Less Than the Minimum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide less than the minimum number of parking spaces required by Table 8A.2-1, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings otherwise required for a conditional use permit: (A) That adequate measures will be put in place through a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program, as required by Section 31.7 to reduce parking demand, such as promoting use of public transit, bicycling, and walking, and allowing modified working hours and telecommuting; and (B) That the reduction or elimination of the required parking spaces will not substantially reduce the availability of on-street parking for the occupants of nearby commercial and, or residential buildings.
(2) Parking Spaces More Than the Maximum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide more than the maximum number of private parking spaces allowed by Table 8A.2-1, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required for a conditional use permit:
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-5
(A) That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the additional parking is required to meet the anticipated parking demand of the proposed uses; and (B) That the provision of the additional parking will not result in an overdependence on automobiles and will not adversely affect transit, bicycle, or pedestrian access to the site or other adjacent uses.
8A2.3 DESIGN STANDARDS - The parking area design standards of this section apply to all off-street parking areas in the CMU and RC zoning districts. All required parking spaces and associated maneuvering aisles, driveways, and other related features shall be designed and arranged so as to provide motor vehicles with adequate ingress to and egress from all required parking spaces, and to provide pedestrians with adequate access to parked vehicles.
(a) Parking Layout and Dimensions. The layout and dimensions of off-street parking facilities shall be as set forth in Figure 8A.3-1 and Table 8A.3-1, as further provided below.
(1) Regulatory and Calculated Dimensions. Stall width, stall length, and aisle width, as shown in Table 8A.3-1, are regulatory. Other dimensions shown in Table 8A.3-1 are calculated from these required dimensions, and are provided for convenience.
(2) Stall Width and Length. As indicated in Table 8A.3-1, the required minimum stall width and length for various parking angles are as set forth below. Compact spaces with an eight-foot width and 16-foot length are permitted for up to 33 percent of the required spaces. (A) Width. For parking angles of more than 30 degrees the required minimum stall width is eight feet six inches. For parking angles of 30 degrees or less, the required minimum stall width is eight feet. (B) Length. For all parking angles other than parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is 18 feet. For parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is 20 feet.
(3) Aisle Width for Parking Angles Not Shown. For parking angles not shown in Table 8A.3-1, the required aisle width shall be interpolated from the values in the table. For example, for a parking angle of 70 degrees, which is two-thirds of the increment between 60 degrees and 75 degrees, the required one-way aisle width is 18 feet eight inches, which is two-thirds of the increment between the required aisle widths for 60-degree parking and 75-degree parking, 16 feet and 20 feet respectively.
(4) Alternate Maneuvering Aisle and Parking Space Widths. For parking angles equal to or greater than 45 degrees and less than 90 degrees, one-way aisle width may be decreased by three inches for each one-inch increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches. For 90-degree parking, one-way and two-way aisle width may be decreased by three inches for each one-inch increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches and a minimum aisle width of twenty-two feet.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-6
(5) Two-Way Modules. Table 8A.3-1 provides the dimensions for parking modules with one-way traffic. For parking modules with two-way traffic, add the difference in width between a two-way aisle and a one-way aisle. For example, for a two-way module with a parking angle of 45-degrees, add eight feet, which is the difference between a two-way aisle (20 feet) and a one-way aisle (12 feet).
(6) Overhang. Parking stall lengths, except for parallel spaces, may be reduced by two feet where the parking stall is designed to abut a landscaped area a minimum of five feet wide, such that the front of the vehicle can overhang the landscaped area.
(7) Spaces Abutting Walls or Posts. For each side of a parking space abutting a wall or post, an additional foot of width shall be required.

8A.5.3 MODIFICATIONS - In approving a project, the Director or the Planning Commission, as the case may be, may modify the number and size of loading spaces required because of the nature of the use or the design of the project.
8A.5.4 MANEUVERING AREAS - All off-street loading spaces shall be designed and located so that there is sufficient off-street maneuvering area to accommodate vehicles using the loading spaces. Maneuvering areas shall be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle intended to use the loading spaces and shall not be encumbered by parking stalls or physical obstructions.
8A.5.5 SURFACE AND MAINTENANCE - Loading spaces and the maneuvering areas and driveways serving them shall be paved and maintained with concrete, asphalt, or similar material of sufficient thickness and consistency to support anticipated traffic volumes and weights; properly graded for drainage; and maintained in good condition free of weeds, dust, trash, and debris.
8A.5.6 LOCATION - Loading spaces shall be located on the same lot on which the use for which they are required is located, except that, upon the granting of a conditional use permit, loading spaces may be provided in a common loading area serving multiple adjacent uses and located on an adjacent lot within 300 feet of the lot on which the use requiring the loading spaces is located. To grant such a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission shall make the following findings in addition to the findings otherwise required:
(a) That the common loading area results in a more efficient design than individual loading
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-18
areas serving each use separately;
(b) That the total number of loading spaces provided in the common loading area is no less than the number of loading spaces that would be required if the uses served were located in a single facility; and

8A.5.10 LIGHTING - All exterior loading spaces and the maneuvering areas and driveways serving them shall be provided with lighting meeting the minimums established for parking areas.
8A.6 ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE WITH PARKING REQUIREMENTS
8A.6.1 ALTERNATIVE PARKING AND LOADING PLAN - Where an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that variations in the standards or dimensions otherwise required by this section are warranted for uses with unique needs, an alternative parking area design and loading plan may be allowed with approval of a conditional use permit. To grant such a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission must make all of the following findings in addition to the findings otherwise required:
(a) That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the alternative plan is a superior solution and the requested modifications in the design standards are warranted; and
(b) That the alternative parking arrangement will be in place at all times during operation of the principal uses to be served by the parking.
8A.6.2 VALET PARKING - Valet parking may be permitted as a means of satisfying all or a portion of the off-street parking requirement. Valet parking may be used to accommodate more parking spaces on the site of the principal use served by the parking than could be accommodated in conformance with the design standards of this section. It may also be used to provide off-site parking. No valet parking shall cause interference with the public use of rights-of-way or imperil public safety.
8A.6.3 ACCESS AND PARKING IN-LIEU FEES - As an alternative to providing off-street parking on-site or off-site, project applicants may elect to pay a fee in-lieu to fund public
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
8A-19
access and parking improvements for all or a portion of the required spaces. This optional Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee is intended to enable the City to (1) acquire sites for and develop off-street public parking, or to lease unused, or underutilized private parking for public use to accommodate auto access and vehicle storage demand that cannot be addressed either on site, or on-street in the vicinity of the project, or (2) to fund transportation demand management programs and services, and/or public transportation, bicycle, and/or pedestrian facilities and services, as necessary to accommodate an equivalent number of person trips to the site. The fee shall be established by the City Council and administered by the Director on a per vehicle trip basis, such that the developer of a nonresidential project contributes toward the provision of parking and/or non-auto facilities and services accommodating the same number of person trips to the site as would have been accommodated by the provision of the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required by this section, as adjusted by other provisions of this section. The Director shall determine the vehicle trip generation rate for each land use or site seeking to use the Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee option with reference to the vehicle trip generation rates published in the latest edition of the Institute for Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, with adjustments for mixing of uses, density of population and employment, and proximity to frequent transit service. An Access and Parking in-lieu fee shall be provided for nonresidential uses only as follows:
(a) Parking In-Lieu Fee Amount. The amount of the parking in-lieu fee shall be as set forth in the Citys Master Fee Schedule and, for projects that would otherwise have to provide 20 or more spaces, the Director shall have the right to determine whether to accept payment of the fee for all or only a portion of the required parking.
(b) Deposit of Funds. Parking in-lieu fees shall be deposited with the City prior to issuance of a building permit in a separate fund to be known as the Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee Fund and shall be used only as described in this section.
(c) Refund of Fee. A parking in-lieu fee may be refunded, without interest, to the person who made such payment, or his or her assignee or designee, if additional off-street parking spaces are provided for such building or use by others than the City, so as to satisfy the parking requirement for which the in-lieu payment was made. To obtain a refund, the required off-street parking spaces must be in place prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy and before funds are spent or committed by the City.
8A.7 TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
8A.7.1 PURPOSE - The specific purposes of the Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Program requirements are to promote maximum efficiency in the existing transportation system and to further the transportation goals and implement the policies of the Belmont General Plan, Belmont Village Specific Plan, and the San Francisco Bay Area Clean Air Plan, including reducing total vehicle miles traveled (VMT), while enhancing access and expanding mobility by:
(a) Promoting and encouraging the use of transit, ridesharing, bicycling, walking, flexible work hours and telecommuting as alternatives to solo driving;
(b) Promoting the more efficient utilization of existing transportation facilities and ensuring that new developments are designed in ways to maximize the potential for people and goods to arrive/depart by walking, cycling, riding public transportation, or

10.6 VARIANCES. A variance allows deviation from site development standards where because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, strict application of the Zoning Ordinance deprives the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under an identical zoning classification. A variance may not be granted for a parcel of property which authorizes a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the zoning regulations governing the parcel.
10.6.1 Approval Authority. The Zoning Administrator may grant a variance to commercial and manufacturing site development standards of up to 10 percent. The Planning Commission may grant all other variances.
10.6.2 Application.

(1) There are special circumstances applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property which do not apply generally to other properties classified in the same zoning district.
(2) The strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity classified in the same zoning district, including causing practical difficulty or unnecessary physical hardship
(3) The granting of the Variance as conditioned will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and classified in the same zoning district.
(4) The granting of the Variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.
(b) Additional Findings For Parking And Loading. The approval authority may grant a Variance for off-street parking facilities or off-street loading facilities if it makes the findings in Subsection (a) and the following additional findings:

In addition to the findings in subsections (a) and (b) as applicable, before approving a Variance the Zoning Administrator must find that the cumulative effect of any previously approved variances will not result in the requested development standard alteration exceeding 10 percent.
10.7 USE PERMITS.

The Commission must deny the application for a Use Permit if it is unable to make the findings.
(1) The location of the proposed use is compatible to other land uses in the general neighborhood area and does not place an undue burden on existing transportation, utilities and service facilities in the vicinity.
(2) The site is of sufficient size to accommodate the proposed use together with all yards, open spaces, walls and fences, parking and loading facilities, landscaping and such other provisions required by this Ordinance.
(3) The site will be served by streets of capacity sufficient to carry the traffic generated by the proposed use.

10.8.3 Approval Authority.
(a) If the application is filed without any accompanying application for another zoning entitlement, the Zoning Administrator shall make a written determination within 45 days and either grant, grant with modifications or deny a request for reasonable accommodation.

City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
10-13

The Planning Commission and City Council shall make the following findings in addition to those required in Section 16 of this Ordinance prior to rezoning any property to the PD District:
1) That the total development in each individual unit therein can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance will be provided that such objective will be attained; that the uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved under other zoning districts.
2) That the streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic and the density will not generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the PD District.
3) That any proposed commercial development can be justified economically at the locations proposed, to provide for adequate commercial facilities of the types proposed.
4) That the economic impact created by the PD District can be absorbed by the City (police and fire service, water supply, sewage disposal, etc.)
5) That the proposed off-street parking is in substantial conformance with the provisions of Section 8 of this Ordinance; that where an applicants proposed off-street parking is less than that set forth by the standards of Section 8 of this Ordinance, circumstances are such that it would be a practical difficulty or create a physical hardship on the applicant for him to conform to the standards of Section 8.3
C. The Planning Commission or City Council may require the submittal of a topographic model of the proposed district to an accurate scale. Both horizontal and vertical scales shall be the same.

(b) The intent of the Design Control District is to establish parameters for building design, alterations and modifications, landscaping, signing, sidewalk design and other features which are necessary to encourage the orderly and harmonious appearance of structures and property, maintain the property and improvement of values of the area; preserve structures and locations of historical value and interest, preserve existing residential structures and enhance the natural scenery; stimulate and maintain a viable central business district in Belmont which is aesthetically pleasing, attractive to shoppers and provides ease of pedestrian access and separation of automotive and pedestrian traffic.
Specific structures deserving special consideration are to be designated by the Planning Commission for recommendation to the City Council.
(c) In any district with which is combined any "D" District, the following guidelines as specified for the respective "D" District shall apply in addition to the guidelines for such district with which the "D" District is combined.
(d) The Design Control District concept may be used in various areas throughout the City of Belmont. The standards in each of these areas may differ to a certain degree depending upon the land uses and character of the area.
*** 22.2 DOWNTOWN DESIGN CONTROL DISTRICT D-1 DISTRICT
The D-1 District is established to provide special guidance pertaining to the landscaping, architecture, color palette, external parking, pedestrian and traffic circulation, signs and all specific design features in the downtown area of the City of Belmont.

(b) To orient and connect the downtown commercial center with the Twin Pines Park and adjacent activities. This connection would be made through the use of landscaped pedestrian malls or concourses.

(d) To encourage compact groupings of shops and uses which will be attractive for pedestrian use.
(e) Uses such as theaters and restaurants, which provide "life" to the downtown should be encouraged to locate there. These types of business help attract people to the area and can make more efficient use of parking facilities.
* 22.4 ARCHITECTURE - To promote a unifying and compatible architecture in the Central District, the following guidelines are established:
(a) The architecture can be developed in either an historic** or contemporary vein. New buildings should blend with acceptable existing buildings in the District. These buildings and structures may generally include, but are not limited to, the following features.

Landscaping materials so allocated shall be selected by the Commission and costs of installation shall be borne by the applicant.
(b) A minimum of one tree shall be provided for each 400 square feet or fraction thereof required landscaped area.

Section 23.01 Purpose and Applicability
23.01.01 Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to regulate signs as an information system that expresses the character and environment of Belmont and implements the General Plan, consistent with State and federal law. These regulations recognize the importance of business activity to the economic vitality of the City as well as the need to protect the visual environment. Specifically, these regulations are intended to:
A. Provide adequate opportunity for the exercise of the free speech right by display of a message or an image on a sign, while balancing that opportunity with other community and public interests;
B. Provide minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property, public welfare, and traffic safety by controlling the design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location and maintenance of signs and of sign structures;
C. Reduce visual clutter and preserve and enhance the visual attractiveness of the City for residents, businesses and visitors;
D. Protect and enhance property values and community appearance by encouraging signs that are compatible with the architectural style, character, and scale of the building to which they relate and with adjacent buildings and businesses;
E. Restrict signs that may create a nuisance or violate privacy of nearby properties;
F. Ensure that commercial signs are accessory or auxiliary to a principal business or establishment on or near the same premises, rather than functioning as General Advertising (advertising for hire); and
G. Prohibit signs that may cause traffic or pedestrian safety hazards, interfere with ingress and egress, or create unreasonable hazards or distraction for drivers.
23.01.02 Scope and Applicability
Section 23 consolidates and updates all general provisions regulating signs throughout the City. This Section regulates all signs on private property and signs on public property that are not otherwise regulated by other Chapters and Sections of the Municipal Code.
23.01.03 Severability
This Section is to be severable to the greatest extent provided by law. If any Section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion or provision of this Section is held invalid or unconstitutional or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any other Section, sentence, clause, phrase, word, portion, or provision of this Section which can be given effect without the invalid portion. In adopting this Section, the City Council affirmatively declares that if it had been made aware of any invalid provision(s), it would have approved and adopted the remaining provisions, and that it desires all valid provisions to remain in force.

Section 23.04 Permits Required
With the exception of exempt signs listed in Section 23.03, and temporary signs meeting the standards of Section 23.09, no person or entity shall erect, install, move, alter, or replace a permanent sign without first obtaining approval of a sign permit. Review and permitting procedures are established in Section 23.11.
Section 23.05 General Regulations Applying in All Districts
23.05.01 Citywide Requirements
A. Maximum Sign Area. The maximum allowable sign area for permanent signs, exclusive of area of exempt signs, is based on the zoning district in which the sign is located, the nature of the land use, and the physical type of sign structure. These standards are established in Section 23.06 (Nonresidential), Section 23.07 (Residential), Section 23.08 (Standards for Specific Sign Types), and Section 23.10 (Master Sign Program). Maximum sign area limitations for temporary signs are established in Section 23.09.
B. Noncommercial Messages. Whenever an individual lot, parcel or land use has not used all of its allowable area for signs subject to a sign permit, then the unused portion may be used for signs displaying noncommercial messages; in such cases, a permit is required only if the sign qualifies as a structure, subject to a building permit under the Building Code. Signs originally installed under this provision may not be converted to display commercial messages without a sign permit.
City Council  March 2011
11
C. Applicable Codes. In addition to complying with the provisions of this Section, all signs shall be constructed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code, the Electrical Code, and all other applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies.
D. Encroachment Permits. Any sign, mounted on private property, which projects into or above public property or the public right-of-way, requires an Encroachment Permit approved by the Director of Public Works under the provisions of Chapter 22 of the Municipal Code.
E. Permanent, Legal Signs Run With Land. As to all permanent signs attached to real property, the sign-related rights, duties and obligations arising from this Chapter attach to and travel with the land on which a sign is mounted, installed or displayed; such rights and duties do not travel with the permittee or sign owner. A sign permit is an official authorization to place a specific permanent sign on a specific parcel of land in a specific location. This provision does not modify or affect the law of fixtures, sign-related provisions in private leases, or the ownership of sign structures. This provision does not apply to hand-held signs, personally-attended signs, or aspects of personal appearance. This provision does not prevent a sign owner from removing a sign structure from a given location and installing it in another location, so long as all permit requirements applicable to the new location are satisfied and any permits and/or modifications thereof have been approved and issued.
23.05.02 Changeable Copy
Changeable copy, as defined herein, is prohibited except as follows:
A. On Nonresidential Properties Fronting El Camino Real. See Subsection 23.06.03 (Additional Sign Allowances for Nonresidential Properties Fronting El Camino Real).
B. For Uses Characterized by Public Assembly and Changing Programs or Events. Changeable copy signs are allowed on nonresidential property, subject to a sign permit, provided the copy area does not exceed 75 percent of the maximum allowable sign area.
C. Gas Station Fuel Prices. Changeable copy is allowed for fuel price signs provided the copy area does not exceed 25 percent of the maximum allowable sign area for the establishment.
In all cases, the following requirements shall be met:
D. Illumination. Changeable copy signs are subject to the illumination standards of the district and use of the property on which they are located.
E. Maximum Frequency of Changes. Copy shall not be changed more than once every 24 hours.
23.05.03 Illumination Standards
The intent of these standards is to create a safe and comfortable nighttime environment, and ensure personal, pedestrian, and motor vehicle safety while reducing the negative effects of glare, light pollution and light trespass. The illumination of signs shall be designed, installed and maintained to avoid negative impacts on surrounding right-of-ways and properties. The following standards shall apply to all illuminated signs.
City Council  March 2011
12
A. Light Sources and Shielding Requirements. Light sources shall be concealed or shielded to prevent or to minimize light spillage, glare, momentary blindness, or other annoyance, disability or discomfort to persons within the view of such light sources.
B. Time Controls. All illuminated signs shall be equipped with an automatic timed controller that prevents the operation of lighting fixtures between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. unless a different time limit is established by a Conditional Use Permit.
C. Internally Illuminated Signs. Except for address signs, internally illuminated signs are allowed for nonresidential uses only. On any internally illuminated sign, the sign background or field shall be opaque and of a non-reflective material. Only the following internally illuminated structures are allowed:
1. Stencil-cut Internal Illumination. This form restricts the illuminated portions of the sign to the lettering or logo. The remaining face of the sign is opaque.
2. Channel Letter Internal Illumination. This style of sign is comprised of individual letters and symbols, each with its own internal illumination.
3. Halo Lit Illumination  This channel letter sign has an opaque front, with an open or translucent back such that light from the letter is directed against the surface behind the letter, producing a halo lighting effect around the letter.
D. Light Sources Adjacent to Residential Areas. Illuminated signs located adjacent to any residential area shall be located and installed to reduce glare for residential buildings in the line of sight of the sign.
E. Properties Fronting El Camino Real. For nonresidential properties fronting El Camino Real see Subsection 23.06.03 (Additional Sign Allowances for Nonresidential Properties Fronting El Camino Real).
23.05.04 Maintenance Required
All signs and associated supporting structures shall be maintained undamaged and in good condition.
A. Deteriorated Signs. Any sign or sign structure that is sagging, leaning, fallen, decayed, broken, deteriorated or otherwise dilapidated shall be promptly repaired to the satisfaction of the City, or removed.
B. Maintenance Standards. All parts, portions, units and materials composing a sign, or a sign structure, including all braces, bolts, supporting frames, and fastenings, shall be maintained in a safe condition, painted, adequately protected from weathering, and reasonably free from deterioration, rot, rust, and loosening, so that they do not create a hazard to persons or property, or constitute a nuisance.
C. Summary Removal of Hazards. Whenever any sign, by virtue of its physical nature and condition, poses an immediately and serious threat to public safety, the sign may be removed or repaired by the City, to the extent necessary to protect public safety. The cost of such removal or repair shall be assessed against the sign owner.
City Council  March 2011
13
23.05.05 Materials and Mounting Requirement
A. Materials. Signs shall be made of sturdy, durable materials. Paper, cardboard, canvas and other materials subject to rapid deterioration may only be used for temporary signs.
B. Mounting Requirement. All permanent signs shall be firmly anchored, shall comply with all requirements for public safety, and shall satisfy all applicable safety codes and all other applicable governmental enactments, rules, regulations, or policies.
23.05.06 Message Substitution
A protected noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any duly permitted commercial message or any other protected noncommercial message. Any on-site commercial message may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any other on-site commercial message.
A. No Additional Approval. This message substitution may be made without any additional approval, permitting, registration or notice to the City. The purpose of this provision is to prevent inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular protected noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message.
B. Limitations. This message substitution provision does not: 1) create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot or land use; 2) affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted; 3) allow a change in the physical structure of a sign or its mounting device; or 4) authorize the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message or in place of a noncommercial message.
23.05.07 Non-Conforming Signs
A. Continuance and Maintenance. Non-conforming signs that were legal when first installed, and which have not been modified so as to become illegal, may be continued, except as otherwise provided for in this Subsection.
1. Routine maintenance and repairs may be performed on signs that are non-conforming.
2. A sign that did not conform to law existing at the time of its erection shall be deemed an illegal sign and shall not be a non-conforming sign. The passage of time does not cure illegality from the outset.
B. Alterations and Additions to Non-Conforming Signs. No non-conforming sign shall be moved, altered, enlarged, or converted to a different display technology or methodology unless required by law or unless the moving, alteration or enlargement will result in the elimination of the nonconformity. Modifications to either sign copy or the design of a sign display shall not constitute an alteration that would require the elimination of a signs nonconformity.
C. Restoration of a Damaged Sign.
1. Whenever a non-conforming sign shall be destroyed by vandalism, fire or other calamity to the extent of 50 percent (50%) or less, the sign may be restored to
City Council  March 2011
14
display the pre-existing sign area and the non-conforming use of the sign may be resumed, provided that restoration is started within one (1) year and diligently pursued to completion and the height of the restored sign conforms to the standards of Section 23.
2. Whenever a non-conforming sign shall be destroyed by vandalism, fire or other calamity to a greater extent than 50 percent (50%), or shall be voluntarily razed or shall be required by law to be razed, the sign shall not be restored except in full conformity with Section 23.
3. The extent of damage or partial destruction shall be based upon the ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the sign to its condition prior to such damage or partial destruction, to the estimated cost of duplicating the entire sign as it existed prior thereto. Estimates for this purpose shall be made or shall be reviewed and approved by the Director of Community Development.
D. Signs Rendered Non-Conforming by Annexation. Any sign that becomes non-conforming subsequent to the effective date of this Section by reason of annexation to the City of the territory, upon which the sign is located, shall be subject to the provisions of this Section
E. Façade Improvement Funds. For any project that City Façade Improvement Program funds are provided, all existing non-conforming signs on the subject property shall be brought into full compliance with existing sign standards at the time of the façade improvement as a condition for the receipt of City funding.
F. Abandoned Nonconforming Signs. Any nonconforming sign structure which has carried no message for more than 90 days, or which no longer identifies a bona fide establishment, business, lessor or owner, shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the property, after notice and hearing required by law.
23.05.08 On-site/Off-site Distinction
Throughout Section 23, the distinction between on-site (or on-premise or point-of-sale) and off-site (or off-premise or non-point-of-sale) applies only to commercial messages.
23.05.09 Signs That Display Obsolete Commercial Messages.
Any sign copy that displays a commercial message identifying an establishment, lessor or owner whose use of the premises has ceased for more than 90 days, or which no longer identifies a bona fide establishment, lessor, service, owner, product, activity or event shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the property.
Section 23.06 Sign Standards for Nonresidential Districts
This Subsection establishes standards for signs in Nonresidential Districts. These signs also are subject to the regulations in Section 23.05 (General Regulations Applying in All Districts) and in Section 23.08 (Standards for Specific Sign Types).

City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
25-1
*SECTION 25 - SIGNAL RECEIVING OR TRANSMITTING ANTENNAS
25.1 PURPOSE: The City Council finds that the erection and maintenance of parabolic (satellite-dish type) signal, ham radio, and other large receiving or transmitting antennas affect the safety and welfare of residents of the City of Belmont by increasing the potential for property damage and personal injury during periods of high velocity wind. The City of Belmont is subject to strong winds due to steep terrain and a peninsular location which constitute an actual danger to property and the public. The erection of dish-type antennas in residential areas increases the chance of property damage and personal injury.
Further, the erection of antennas may affect the aesthetic quality of life by creating unattractive appurtenances to buildings, blocking and degrading views, and creating visual clutter. In order to protect and preserve the health, safety, welfare, and aesthetic quality of life it is necessary to establish standards and procedures for the erection and maintenance of antennas. Due to their size and the associated magnitude of visual and aesthetic impact, It is the purpose of this ordinance to prohibit roof-mounting of satellite-dish type antennas in residential areas, and to limit the size of satellite-dish type antennas in order to further promote safety and protect the public aesthetics. The standards contained in this ordinance are the least necessary to obtain the community objectives of promoting public safety and aesthetic quality while providing for reasonable signal access.
** These standards and criteria are also intended by assist wireless communication service providers and their neighbors in understanding the Citys standards and permit process for such facilities. The goal is to balance the needs of wireless communication providers and users, the regulatory functions of the City, the rights guaranteed by the federal government, and the potential impacts upon neighboring property owners in designing appropriate wireless communication facilities.
25.2 PERMIT REQUIRED: No antenna shall be constructed or erected without first obtaining the necessary building and conditional use permit required by this chapter, unless determined to be exempt by the Director of Planning.
25.3 EXEMPTION FROM USE PERMIT REQUIREMENT: The following antennas are exempt from the conditional use permit requirements:
25.3.1 Standard UHF/VHF television and FM/AM radio antennas designed for receiving signals from ground based broadcast systems and mono-pole and similar type communications antennas, provided all such antennas meet the following criteria:
(a) Roof- or building-mounted antennas shall not exceed 9 feet in height or 4 feet above the highest roof elevation, whichever is less.
(b) Roof- or building- mounted antennas shall be placed at the eave edge of the rear roof line, in situations where such a placement will decrease visibility from the public rights-of-way.

The proposal must include the following calculations. The density bonus units may not be included in determining the percentage of base units that qualify a project for a density bonus under State Density Bonus Law.

26-2
(2) Requested Incentive(s). The request for particular incentive(s) must include a pro forma or other report evidencing that the requested incentive(s) results in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions that are necessary to make the housing units economically feasible. The report shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the city to verify its conclusions. If the city requires the services of specialized financial consultants to review and corroborate the analysis, the applicant will be liable for all costs incurred in reviewing the documentation.
(3) Requested Waiver(s). The written proposal shall include an explanation of the waiver(s) of development standards requested and why they are necessary to make the construction of the project physically possible. Any requested waiver(s) shall not exceed the limitations provided by Section 26.8 and to the extent such limitations are exceeded will be considered as a request for an incentive.
(4) Fee. Payment of the fee in an amount set by resolution of the city council to reimburse the city for staff time spent reviewing and processing the State Density Bonus Law application submitted under this Section.
26.5 DENSITY BONUS.
(a) A density bonus for a housing development means a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the applicable zoning and land use designation on the date the application is deemed complete. The amount of the allowable density bonus shall be calculated as provided in State Density Bonus Law. The applicant may select from only one of the income categories identified in State Density Bonus Law and may not combine density bonuses from different income categories to achieve a larger density bonus.
(b) The body with approval authority for the planning approval sought will approve, deny or modify requests for density bonus and incentive(s) in accordance with State Density Bonus Law. Nothing herein prevents the city from granting a greater density bonus and additional incentives or waivers than that provided for herein, or from providing a lesser density bonus and fewer incentives and waivers than that provided for herein, when the housing development does not meet the minimum thresholds.
26.6 INCENTIVES.
(a) The number of incentives granted shall be based upon the number the applicant is entitled under the State Density Bonus Law.
(b) An incentive includes a reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural requirements that result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. An incentive may be the approval of mixed use zoning (e.g., commercial) in conjunction with a housing project if the mixed use will reduce the cost of the housing development and is compatible with the housing project. An incentive may, but need not be, the provision of a direct financial incentive, such as the waiver of fees.
(c) A requested incentive may be denied only for those reasons provided in State Density Bonus Law. Denial of an incentive is a separate and distinct act from a decision to deny or approve the entirety of the project.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
26-3
26.7 DISCRETIONARY APPROVAL AUTHORITY RETAINED. The granting of a density bonus or incentive(s) shall not be interpreted in and of itself to require a general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval. If an incentive would otherwise trigger one of these approvals, when it is granted as an incentive, no general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval is required. However, if the base project without the incentive requires a general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval, the city retains discretion to make or not make the required findings for approval of the base project.
26.8 WAIVERS. A waiver is a modification to a development standard such that construction at the increased density would be physically possible. Modifications to floor area ratio in an amount equivalent to the percentage density bonus utilized shall be allowable as a waiver. Requests for an increase in floor area ratio above that equivalent percentage shall be considered a request for an incentive. Other development standards include, but are not limited to, a height limitation, a setback requirement, an on-site open space requirement, or a parking ratio that applies to a residential development. An applicant may request a waiver of any development standard to make the project physically possible to construct at the increased density. To be entitled to the requested waiver, the applicant must show that without the waiver, the project would be physically impossible to construct. There is no limit on the number of waivers.
26.9 AFFORDABLE HOUSING AGREEMENT. Before project approval, the applicant must enter into an affordable housing agreement with the city, to be executed by the city manager, to the satisfaction of the city attorney guaranteeing the affordability of the rental or ownership units for a minimum of thirty (30) years and identifying the type, size and location of each affordable unit, and containing requirements for administration, reporting and monitoring. The agreement must be recorded in the San Mateo County recorders office.
26.10 DESIGN AND QUALITY.
(a) Affordable units must be constructed concurrently with market rate units and must be integrated into the project.
(b) Affordable units must be of equal design and quality as the market rate units.
(c) Exteriors and interiors, including architecture, elevations, floor plans, interior finishes and amenities of the affordable units must be similar to the market rate units.
(d) The number of bedrooms in the affordable units must be consistent with the mix of market rate units.
(e) The requirements of subsections (a) through (d) may be waived or modified on a case by case basis for affordable housing units developed for special groups, including housing for special needs or seniors.
(f) Parking standards shall be modified as allowable under State Density Bonus Law and anything beyond those standards shall be considered a request for an incentive.

4 Amended by Ord. 2017-1126, §4, 11/28/2017
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
29-7
construction of affordable units on a single site. The decision-making body may grant a credit for off-site construction if it makes all of the following findings:
(A) For ownership projects, the off-site location includes either units to be sold to moderate-income households at affordable sales price equal to at least twenty percent of the market-rate units in the residential project; or, includes units to be rented to low income households at affordable rents equal to at least twenty percent of the market-rate units in the residential project;
(B) For rental projects, the off-site location includes units to be rented to low income households at affordable rents equal to at least twenty percent of the market-rate units in the residential project;
(C) Financing or a viable financing plan, which may include public funding, is in place for the off-site affordable units;
(D) The off-site location is suitable for the proposed affordable housing, consistent with any affordable housing guidelines and the Housing Element, and will not tend to cause residential segregation; and
(E) Construction of the off-site affordable units has not commenced before the first approval of the residential project, and construction of the off-site units will occur concurrently with construction of the market-rate units in the residential project as described in Section 29.6(c).

No off-site alternative may be approved by the City if a density bonus or other regulatory incentive is requested for the site on which the affordable housing is to be built. Any off-site alternative must comply with the density, intensity and other development standards that are permitted under the zone for the site.
(d) Land Donation for Affordable Housing Development.
(1) The applicant for a residential rental project may donate land in accordance with this Section 29.7(d) as an alternative to providing on-site affordable units under Section 29.3(a)(3). The decision-making body may grant a credit for donation of land if it makes all of the following findings:
(A) The applicant will donate and transfer the land no later than the date of the residential rental project approval;
(B) The developable acreage, zoning classification, and general plan designation of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to low income households in an amount not less than twenty percent of the number of market rate residential units of the proposed residential rental project;
(C) The transferred land is served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure;
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance

(F) The land will be transferred to the City of Belmont or to a housing developer approved by the City of Belmont;
(G) The transferred land will be within one-quarter mile of the proposed large rental project and will not tend to cause residential segregation; and
(H) Financing or a viable financing plan, which may include public funding, is in place for the low income units.
(e) Nonresidential Projects. An applicant for a nonresidential development may submit an affordable housing plan that proposes to mitigate the affordable housing impacts of the development through the construction of affordable units, either on-site or off-site, rather than pay housing impact fees. The decision-making body may approve or conditionally approve such an alternative if it determines, based on substantial evidence, that such alternative compliance will provide as much or more affordable housing at the same or lower income levels as would payment of housing impact fees, is consistent with the general plan and housing element and the provisions of this section, and will otherwise provide equal or greater public benefit than would payment of the housing fee.

SECTION 31  VILLAGE DISTRICTS1
Editors Note: Current through Ordinance 2017-1125
31.1 PURPOSE.
31.1.1 General Purpose of Village Districts. The regulations of this section are intended to implement the Belmont Village Specific Plan and to realize Belmont Villages potential as the citys center of civic life with a unique sense of place. More specifically, the purposes of these regulations are three-fold:
(a) To create an attractive, vibrant, mixed use town center for Belmont, offering shopping, restaurants, entertainment, employment, and residential uses in a compact, pedestrian oriented setting;
(b) To enhance pedestrian and bicycle connections so that residents, visitors, and workers can safely and conveniently walk, bike, and take transit to, from, and within Belmont Village; and
(c) To support design of building frontages, streetscapes, and public spaces that will create a lively and attractive public realm with a distinctive identity, consistent with the General Plan and the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance.
31.1.2 Scope and Relation to Other Sections of the Zoning Ordinance.
(a) This section establishes use regulations and development standards that apply to all development and proposals for new uses and alterations and additions to existing uses within the Belmont Village Specific Plan area.
(b) Other Sections of the Zoning Ordinance apply within Village area that are not specifically modified or superseded by these regulations, and, in the case of a conflict, the more restrictive provisions apply.
(c) Notwithstanding the manner in which these regulations apply to proposals for new uses and revisions to existing uses, these Village regulations are not intended to designate any existing use as a prohibited use. Rather, nonconformities within the Village area, including nonconforming uses, buildings, signs, and site features, are regulated in the same manner as they are citywide under the Zoning Ordinance.
31.1.3 Applicability. The section applies to the area generally bounded by Wessex Way, Hiller Street and the City limits on the east, and Sixth Avenue from Broadway to Hill Street and Middle Road on the west, which is the area included in the Village Zoning Districts. The Zoning Map shows the Village zoning designations of all parcels.
31.1.4 Definitions. As used in this section:
Abutting means sharing a common boundary with the adjacent parcel and contiguous to it. Lots that are across the street or only have a common corner are not abutting.
1 Added by Ord. 2017-1125, §2, 11/28/2017
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-2
Lighting, Full Cutoff means a full cutoff light fixture meets the adopted criteria of the Illuminating Society of North America and does not allow any light to emit above an angle of 90 degrees, and above a vertical angle of 80 degrees the luminous intensity cannot exceed 10 percent of the light of the lamp or lamps in the luminaire.
Streetwall means the building wall that faces the front of a lot. Measurement of the streetwall is determined from finished grade on the street-side of the wall to the top of the wall, including a parapet, but not including any pitched roof.
31.1.5 Permit Procedures, and Variances.
(a) The procedures for obtaining permits and other approvals are contained in Sections 10 and 11, the procedures for design review are in Section 13, the procedures for variances are in Section 14, and the procedures for appeals are in Section 15; all of these procedures apply to all development subject to this section.
(b) Variances from the residential density, floor area ratios, and height limits established in this section may not be granted, because these limits are prescribed in the Belmont Village Specific Plan; any proposed deviation from a prescribed residential density, floor area ratio, or height limit requires a Specific Plan Amendment unless the Specific Plan specifically provides for such deviations (e.g. increased floor area for community benefits or increased density for affordable housing).
(c) The provisions of this Section supersede the sections establishing permitted uses and conditional uses, and the building height, intensity and density regulations for the prior zoning for the Village area. This Section supersedes in part (as noted above) and supplements other sections of the Zoning Ordinance, but does not repeal any sections of the Zoning Ordinance not explicitly modified by this Section, and all of these other sections remain in effect.
31.1.6 Consistency with the Specific Plan; Directors Decisions and Appeals
(a) These Village Zoning District Regulations are intended to be consistent with the Belmont Village Specific Plan and ensure that all new development and alterations and additions to existing uses that are subject to discretionary review are consistent with this Specific Plan. Should any provisions of this section be determined inconsistent with the Specific Plan, the Specific Plan prevails.
(b) The Community Development Director is authorized to determine the extent of any such inconsistency and issue a decision to resolve the matter.
(c) The Directors decisions under this Section may be appealed to the Planning Commission (the Commission) and City Council under the procedures in Section 15 except as provided in this paragraph. The Planning Commission may either affirm the underlying determination or forward the appeal to the City Council with a recommendation to affirm or modify the Directors decision.

(a) Additional Setback Requirement Adjacent to R Districts. In any Village District that abuts an R District, parking and loading facilities and buildings and structures shall be at least 10 feet from the interior lot line; these setbacks shall be permanently landscaped, except for paved area required for pedestrian or vehicular access.
(b) Transitional Requirements for Lots Abutting R Districts. To protect privacy and minimize sunlight blockage, structures shall not intercept a 45-degree daylight plane inclined inward starting from a height of 12 feet above existing grade at the lot line, as shown on figure 31-2.
Figure 31-2: Setback and Transitional Requirements for Lots Abutting R Districts
(c) Base Density and Minimum FAR. New development must achieve at least the minimum density or minimum FAR shown in Table 31-2, where specified. For example, residential
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-18
development in the VHDR district must be at least 21 units per acre, and single use or mixed use development in the VC district must be at least 0.5 FAR.
(d) Determining Residential Density in Mixed Use Projects. In mixed use projects combining commercial and residential uses, the total maximum FAR standard shall apply along with the maximum residential density standards if one is specified in Table 31-2.
(e) Density Bonus for Affordable Housing. Qualifying residential development is entitled to density bonus provisions (and associated required parking reductions) for affordable housing otherwise required by the Zoning Ordinance. The density bonus shall be in addition to the base density shown in Table 31-2. This density bonus shall not be combined with the additional density and FAR allowed for community benefits.
(f) Increased FAR, Height, and Density Incentives for Community Benefits. After conducting a public hearing, the City Council may grant increased FAR, density or height in return for provision of specific community benefits, as listed below or identified by the City Council, if the Council determines that (1) making such an award is in the Citys interest and will help implement the General Plan and the Belmont Village Specific Plan, (2) these benefits cannot be realized without granting increased FAR, height, and/or density, and (3) that the increase granted is the minimum necessary to realize these benefits and no adverse impacts or land use incompatibilities will be created that are judged unacceptable. The decision to grant increased FAR, density or height is discretionary, and the Council is not obligated to grant any increase if any of these required findings cannot be made.
(1) For Lot Consolidation. In order to promote the consolidation of small lots into larger sites, which are better able to accommodate mixed use development and thus confer community benefits, the maximum allowable base FAR shall increase based on site size, within the allowable range for community benefits specified in Table 31-2. This table shows the base FAR based on the gross area of a development site; the additional FAR allowable with lot consolidation, which creates development sites that are 12,000 square feet or more in size, is 10 percent of the base FAR. This additional FAR may be combined with additional FAR earned for other community benefits listed in paragraph (B) below.
(2) For Other Community Benefits. Increased FAR, height, and density up to the maximum shown in Table 31-1 may be approved by the City Council for the following community benefits: (A) On-site affordable housing in an amount exceeding the Citys requirements for inclusionary housing established in the Zoning Ordinance. (B) Public access easements, wider sidewalks, and additional public right-of-way provided where identified in the Specific Plan. (C) Public right-of-way improvements, which are in addition to those required to serve new development. (D) Privately owned publicly accessible open space exceeding the minimum requirements of this section, and consistent with the general types and locations of desired public parks and plazas identified in the Specific Plan.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-19
(E) Below-market rental rates guaranteed for a minimum of ten years for a day care center, cultural facility or incubator space for qualifying small businesses. (F) Retention or construction of retail or office commercial development within the Village Corridor Mixed Use District. (G) Contributions to a City established fund for purposes of benefitting Community or Regional recreational or cultural use if one is created. (H) Community recreational facilities, such as an ice rink. (I) Any other community benefit, as determined by the City Council after a duly-noticed public hearing, to be significant, substantial and essential for Specific Plan implementation and which would not otherwise be provided if increased FAR, height or density is not approved.
(3) Monitoring of Community Benefit Program. The City Council should periodically review community benefits derived under this program and, after receiving a Directors report on the programs accomplishments and taking public comment at a duly-noticed public hearing, determine whether any program modifications should be recommended to the City Council.
(g) Building Height.
(1) Ground Floor Elevation. The finished floor elevation of commercial development shall not be greater than one foot above the adjacent sidewalk level. Residential development may have a finished floor elevation up to five feet above sidewalk level to provide more interior privacy for residents.
(2) Allowed Exceptions. Non-habitable building features such as chimneys (up to 6 feet in width), cupolas, flagpoles, monuments, steeples, roof screens, equipment, and similar structures, covering no more than 20 percent of the top floor roof area to which they are accessory, may exceed maximum permitted height standards by 8 feet.
(3) Sloping Sites. On lots with a grade change of 10 percent or more between two side lot lines or between a front and rear lot line, building height shall be measured for a reference grade plane, representing the average of finished ground level adjoining the building at exterior walls. When the finished ground level slopes away from the exterior walls, the reference ground plane shall be established by the lowest point within the area between the building and the adjacent lot line or, if the lot line is more than five feet from the building, between the building and a point five feet from the building.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-20
Figure 31-3: Building Height Limits and Allowed Exceptions
(h) Building Bulk. Building designs shall reduce the floorplate of each story above the first floor to avoid large-scale bulky or boxy building forms.
(1) Upper Floors. Each story above the second story shall be less than the first floor footplate as described in Table 31 2: Village Zoning District Development Standards. The Planning Commission may grant exemptions to this standard where ground floor space includes publicly-accessible walkways or other community benefits that reduce the area of the ground floor available for tenant use.
(2) Primary Street Frontage. No more than 20 percent of the reduced footplate of the upper levels shall be along the primary street frontage.
(3) Building Articulation. Building design shall include adequate features to create visual variety.
(4) Modules. Long facades shall be broken up into smaller modules. Buildings shall be articulated in 25 to 50 foot increments to be consistent with traditional development patterns in the Village.
(5) Three-Dimensional. Building mass and surfaces shall be articulated with three-dimensional elements that create visual interplay of light and shadows. Examples of three-dimensional elements include cornices, brackets, awnings, window trim, recessed windows, door surrounds, and recessed building entrances.
(i) Limitations on Blank Walls. For large buildings, the primary frontage and corner street side frontage above the ground floor shall include one or more offsets, recesses, or projections at least one foot in depth and five feet width, providing shadows or visual
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-21
interest for at least 25 percent of the frontage. Exceptions to this standard may be permitted through Design Review.
(j) Build-to Lines. On sites that are within the Active Use Frontage Overlay, streetwalls shall be located at (or within 10 feet of) the sidewalk for at least 90 percent of the primary street frontage, in order to create a pedestrian-oriented, continuous streetwall. Along other street frontages, at least 70 percent of the street wall shall be located at or within 10 feet of the sidewalk. Exceptions from this requirement for ground floor residential uses, for pedestrian or vehicular access to the rear of the lot, and for building entry designs and courtyards that create welcoming features along the street may be approved through Design Review.
Figure 31-4: Building Placement
(k) Ground Floor Transparency. Exterior walls facing and within 20 feet of a front or street side lot line shall include windows, doors, or other openings located between 2.5 and seven feet above the level of the sidewalk. No wall shall run in a continuous plane for more than 20 feet without an opening.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-22
FIGURE 31-5: GROUND FLOOR TRANSPARENCY
(1) Design of Required Openings. Openings fulfilling this requirement shall have transparent or moderately tinted glazing and provide views into work areas, display areas, sales areas, lobbies, or similar active spaces, or into window displays that are at least three feet deep and five feet wide. Shading or use of drapes or other internal window covering for energy efficiency may be approved.
(2) Exceptions for Parking Garages. Multi-level garages are not required to meet the building transparency requirement of this subsection. Within the AUFO they must be wrapped with street-level retail or other active uses, and entries must be set back from the sidewalk and recessed within the garage structure.
(3) Alternatives through Design Review. Alternatives to the building transparency requirement may be permitted through Design Review if: (A) The proposed use has unique operational characteristics with which providing the required windows and openings is incompatible, such as in the case of a cinema or theater; and (B) Street-facing building walls will exhibit architectural relief and detail, and will be enhanced with landscaping in such a way as to create visual interest at the pedestrian level.
(l) Building Entrances. The primary pedestrian access to all ground-level commercial uses shall be from a public sidewalk. In mixed-use developments, entrances to residential units shall be physically separated from the entrance to the commercial use and clearly marked with a physical feature such as a recess or projection incorporated into the building or appropriately-scaled element applied to the façade.
(m) Outdoor Living Area for Residential Units. Requirements for outdoor living area for residential units, which may be met by common or private open space or a combination of the two, are defined in Table 31-2. Common areas typically consist of landscaped areas, patios, swimming pools, barbeque areas, and similar improvements designed to serve residents. Landscaped rooftop gardens may fulfill a portion of this requirement. Private areas typically consist of balconies, decks, fenced yards, and similar areas directly accessible from a unit.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-23
(n) Landscaping.
(1) Amount Required. The minimum required amount of on-site landscaping is defined in Table 31-2. This minimum amount is in addition to required landscaping of any on-site surface parking area. Landscaping along a public sidewalk, pedestrian walkway, public seating area or plaza and in rooftop gardens counts toward fulfillment of this requirement.
(2) Trees. A minimum of one tree shall be provided for each 400 square feet or fraction thereof of all required landscaped areas. This number may be reduced with approval of an alternative landscape plan if the Director determines that a different number of trees is warranted because of existing conditions and/or the number of street trees in the vicinity.
(3) Water Efficiency. Landscaping shall be designed and plantings selected so that water use is minimized, as defined in Belmont City Code Section 25.5-26.
31.5 STREET FRONTAGE STANDARDS
31.5.1 Street Typology Established. The Village street typology defined in the Specific Plan and illustrated in Figure 31-6 is established to provide a basis for street frontage development standards for each street type. These standards are based upon street width and traffic volume, as well as the desired pedestrian scale, connectivity, safety, and provision of public gathering places described in the Specific Plan.
31.5.2 Streetscape Standards
(a) Table 31-3: Streetscape and Street Frontage Development summarizes the development standards for each streetscape type.
(b) The Planning Commission may allow permitted exceptions to these standards with approval of a conditional use permit where special conditions exist, such as overhead wiring, underground utilities, special access needs, pedestrian visibility, vehicle line-of-site, or similar conditions unique to a specific location.

Ground Floor Design
Where a parking structure faces onto a street, the ground floor must be treated with elements of interest and made as active as possible.
31.6.1 General Regulations and Standards
(a) No Reduction in Off-Street Parking and Loading Spaces. Off-street parking and loading spaces established as of the effective date of this section may not be reduced in number during the life of such building or land use below that which would be required for a new building or use of a similar type under the requirements of this section. All such off-street parking and loading spaces must remain permanently available and accessible for the parking or loading of vehicles by occupants of the property, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to non-occupants, or otherwise made publicly accessible with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on 30 days notice if they become needed by occupants of the property.
(b) Separate Parking and Loading Spaces. No area may be utilized and counted both as a required parking space and a required loading space. However, maneuvering aisles and driveways may serve both required parking spaces and loading spaces if they meet the requirements specified in this Section for both parking and loading facilities.
(c) Parking for Disabled Persons. The number, design, designation, and location of Disabled Person Parking spaces must comply with State law. Such spaces will be counted towards the parking requirements of this section.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-27
(d) Nonconforming Parking Facilities. Existing land uses with off-street parking and loading facilities that do not conform to the requirements of this section may be enlarged or expanded, provided that an in-lieu parking fee is paid, if established, or additional parking and loading facilities are added, either on-site or off-site, so that the parking needs for the enlarged or expanded portion of the use are met. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the Planning Commission for small sites and as an incentive for projects proposing community benefits.
(e) Unbundled Parking. The following rules will apply as conditions of approval to the rental of parking spaces in new Multi-Unit Residential buildings with ten or more rental units:
(1) All off-street parking spaces that are beyond a base allowance of one per unit must be leased separately from the rental fees for dwelling units for the life of the dwelling units, such that potential renters have the option of renting a residential unit with only one parking space at a price lower than would be the case if there were a single price for both the residential unit and all of the parking space(s).
(2) In cases where there are fewer parking spaces than dwelling units, the parking spaces must be offered first to the potential renters of three bedroom or more units, second to potential renters of two bedroom units, and then to potential renters of other units.
(3) Potential renters of affordable units must have an equal opportunity to rent a parking space on the same terms and conditions as offered to potential renters of market-rate units, at a price proportional to the rent of their units as compared to comparable market-rate units. This stipulation shall be included in any agreement recorded between the City and developer pertaining to the affordable housing units.
(4) Parking spaces shall be offered only to residents of the dwelling units served by the off-street parking, except that any surplus spaces may be rented out to non-residents, or otherwise made available for public use, with the provision that such spaces must be vacated on 30 days notice if they are needed by residents. Required visitor spaces may not be rented out, but may be made available for public use.
The Community Development Director may grant an exception from unbundled parking requirements for affordable units that include financing for affordable housing that requires that costs for parking and housing be bundled together.
(f) Garages/Carports/Uncovered Residential Parking. For residential uses, required off-street parking located in the front half of a lot or within 25 feet of the side street on a corner lot must be covered with carport, garage or roofed structure except as allowed below. Uncovered off-street parking may be located in the rear half of the lot when more than 25 feet from a side street.
(g) Surface Parking Lots. Surface parking lots are subject to the following restrictions and standards. The area of a surface parking lot must include all features within the lots outer edges, including all parking spaces, maneuvering aisles, access driveways, and perimeter and interior landscaping, walkways, and other features.
(1) Large Parking Lots. If on-site parking for more than 50 spaces is needed, the parking facilities must be designed to have exceptional landscaping or design features, be
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-28
located such that it is not highly visible from public rights-of-way, be provided within buildings or parking structures or in separate lots that are each less than two acres in size, or be otherwise covered by a structure that serves a non-parking function, such as solar panels, recreational facilities, roof deck, or green roof.
(2) Pedestrian Circulation. Parking lots containing 25 or more spaces must have walkways separated from motor vehicle maneuvering aisles and driveways connecting the principal building or buildings served by the lot to the farthest point of the lot from the main pedestrian entrance of the building. (A) Materials and Width. Walkways must provide at least four feet of unobstructed width and be hard-surfaced. (B) Identification. Pedestrian walkways must be clearly differentiated from driveways, parking aisles, and parking and loading spaces through the use of elevation changes, curb separation, different paving material, or similar method. (C) Separation. Where a pedestrian walkway is parallel and adjacent to an auto travel lane, it must be raised and separated from the travel lane by a raised curb at least six inches high, bollards, or other physical barrier.
31.6.2 Calculation of Required Spaces
(a) Fractions: A fractional space in the calculation of parking or loading spaces of one-half (0.5) or greater is considered one additional space; fractions less than one-half (0.5) require no additional spaces.
(b) On-Street Parking. For non-residential uses, on-street parking spaces located immediately adjacent to the frontage of the property may be counted toward required off-street parking.
(c) Multiple Uses. When two or more principal uses are located on the same lot, the estimated peak period parking demand is the sum of the estimated demand of the various individual uses during the period of peak combined demand for all uses, as determined through a parking study prepared by a qualified individual or firm. See subsection 31.6.6, Parking Reductions, for specific provisions related to shared parking.
(d) Area-Based Estimates. All area-based estimated peak period parking demands are computed on the basis of gross floor area, excluding parking and loading areas.
(e) Exclusion of First 2,500 Square Feet. For all nonresidential uses with area-based estimated peak period parking demands, the first 2,500 square feet of retail or restaurant use are subtracted from the gross square footage of the use when calculating the estimated parking demand.
(f) Motorcycle Parking. A credit of one automobile parking space is given for every four motorcycle parking spaces provided, not to exceed five percent of the total number of automobile parking spaces required. Motorcycle parking spaces must be no less than four feet wide by eight feet long with an aisle width of no less than 10 feet and must be clearly marked.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-29
(g) Minimum Parking Requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this section, at least the minimum number of parking spaces required by Table 31-4 must be provided for each use or site.
(h) Maximum Private Parking Requirements.
(1) Limitation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no more than the maximum number of private, off-street parking spaces specified in Table 31-4 may be provided for each use or site.
(2) Excess Parking to be Shared. Off-street parking spaces may be provided in excess of the maximum number of spaces specified in Table 31-4, provided that all such excess spaces are designed and operated to be shared and publicly accessible parking spaces available for public use at any time, except for uses with safety concerns which the Director confirms are valid and justify not sharing the spaces. Property owners may charge an hourly, daily, or monthly fee for use of any such public access parking provided in excess of the maximum off-street parking limits of this subsection.
(i) Parking Spaces Below the Minimum or Above the Maximum. Parking spaces less than the required minimum or more than the allowed maximum may be provided upon the granting of a conditional use permit as set forth below.
(1) Parking Spaces Less Than the Minimum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide less than the minimum number of parking spaces required by Table 31-4, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings otherwise required for a conditional use permit: (A) That adequate measures will be put in place through the Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs required by Section 31.7 to reduce parking demand, such as promoting use of public transit, bicycling, and walking, and allowing modified working hours and telecommuting; and (B) That the reduction or elimination of the required parking spaces will not substantially reduce the availability of on-street parking for the occupants of nearby commercial and, or residential buildings.
(2) Parking Spaces More Than the Maximum. To grant a conditional use permit to provide more than the maximum number of private parking spaces allowed by Table 31-4, the following findings must be made in addition to the findings required for a conditional use permit: (A) That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the additional parking is required to meet the anticipated parking demand of the proposed uses; and, (B) That the provision of the additional parking will not result in an overdependence on automobiles and will not adversely affect transit, bicycle, or pedestrian access to the site or other adjacent uses.
31.6.3 Location of Required Parking
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-30
(a) Location. Parking must be located either underground, or behind habitable, landscaped, or public plaza space or otherwise appropriately screened from view from a public street. For purposes of this requirement, alleys are not considered public streets. Parking is not permitted to be located between a public street and a building, except on corner lots, if approved as a modification to development standards.
(b) Non-residential Uses. Required parking spaces serving commercial, office, and other non-residential uses must be located on the same lot as the use they serve, or in an off-site parking facility as provided in Subsection 31.6.5, Off-site Parking Facilities.
(c) Residential Uses. Required parking for residential uses must be located on the same lot as the dwelling served, or in a common parking area not more than 400 feet from the dwellings served. Parking may not be located within a required front setback area or yard or street-facing side setback area or yard.
(d) No Street Frontage. When feasible, required parking must be located away from an Active Use Frontage, as illustrated in Figure 31 7: Parking Location and Access.
Figure 31-7: Parking Location and Access
31.6.4 Design Standards for Parking Lots and Structures. The parking area design standards of this section apply to all off-street parking areas. All required parking spaces and associated maneuvering aisles, driveways, and other related features must be designed and arranged so as to provide motor vehicles with adequate ingress to and egress from all required parking spaces, and to provide pedestrians with adequate access to parked vehicles.
(a) Parking Layout and Dimensions. The layout and dimensions of off-street parking facilities are set forth in Figure 31-8 and Table 31-5 and as follows.
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-31
(1) Regulatory and Calculated Dimensions. Stall width, stall length, and aisle width, as shown in Table 31-5, are regulatory. Other dimensions shown in Table 31-5 are calculated from these required dimensions, and are provided for convenience.
(2) Stall Width and Length. As indicated in Table 31-5, the required minimum stall width and length for various parking angles are as set forth below. Compact spaces with an eight-foot width and 16-foot length are permitted for up to 25 percent of the required spaces. (A) Width. For parking angles of more than 30 degrees the required minimum stall width is eight feet six inches. For parking angles of 30 degrees or less, the required minimum stall width is eight feet. (B) Length. For all parking angles other than parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is 18 feet. For parallel parking, the required minimum stall length is 20 feet.
(3) Aisle Width for Parking Angles Not Shown. For parking angles not shown in Table 31-5, the required aisle width shall be interpolated from the values in the table. For example, for a parking angle of 70 degrees, which is two-thirds of the increment between 60 degrees and 75 degrees, the required one-way aisle width is 18 feet eight inches, which is two-thirds of the increment between the required aisle widths for 60-degree parking and 75-degree parking, 16 feet and 20 feet respectively.
(4) Alternate Maneuvering Aisle and Parking Space Widths. For parking angles equal to or greater than 45 degrees and less than 90 degrees, one-way aisle width may be decreased by three inches for each one-inch increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches. For 90-degree parking, one-way and two-way aisle width may be decreased by three inches for each one-inch increase in stall width, up to a maximum stall width of nine feet two inches and a minimum aisle width of twenty-two feet.
(5) Two-Way Modules. Table 31-5 provides the dimensions for parking modules with one-way traffic. For parking modules with two-way traffic, add the difference in width between a two-way aisle and a one-way aisle. For example, for a two-way module with a parking angle of 45-degrees, add eight feet, which is the difference between a two-way aisle (20 feet) and a one-way aisle (12 feet).
(6) Overhang. Parking stall lengths, except for parallel spaces, may be reduced by two feet where the parking stall is designed to abut a landscaped area a minimum of five feet wide, such that the front of the vehicle can overhang the landscaped area.
(7) Spaces Abutting Walls or Posts. An additional foot of width must be provided for each parking space side a abutting a wall or post.

31.6.5 Off-site Parking Facilities. A parking facility serving one or more non-residential uses located on a site other than the location of the use(s) may be used to satisfy the uses on-site parking requirement so long as the parking is available under an enforceable parking agreement and approved by the Director if the standards of this subsection are met.
(a) Location. Any off-site parking facility must be located within 1,000 feet, along a pedestrian route, of the principal entrance containing the use(s) for which the parking is required.
(b) Parking Agreement. A written agreement between the landowner(s) and the owner of the use in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney and recorded against the parking lot property in favor of the use property, which includes:
(1) A guarantee among the landowner(s) for access to and use of the parking facility; and
(2) Reasonable notice provisions so that replacement spaces can be secured if use of the off-site parking facility is terminated.
31.6.6 Parking Reductions. The number of on-site parking spaces required by Table 31-2: Village Zoning District Development Standards may be reduced in accordance with the provisions of this Subsection through the modification to development standards review process.
(a) Residential Uses. If a developer can demonstrate that a multi-family residential, group residential, or service-oriented housing project designed for residents with special needs, such as senior citizens or handicapped individuals, will not generate a need for as much parking as a similar size project designed for a general market, the Planning Commission may approve a reduction in the number of required parking spaces. Upon conversion of a senior citizen or other special needs group housing project to a general market apartment or condominium complex, parking must be provided consistent with the requirements of Table 31 2: Village Zoning District Development Standards.
(b) Shared Parking. Where a shared parking facility serving more than one use will be provided, the total number of required parking spaces may be reduced, if the Planning Commission finds that all of the following are true:

Class 2 bicycle parking may be on a sidewalk or in place of an on-street auto parking space, within 100 feet of a main entry to the building. If existing Class 2 bicycle parking in the required quantities already exists in a public right-of-way immediately fronting a project site, and the spaces are not satisfying bicycle parking requirements for another use, that parking may be used to meet the Class 2 requirement.
(3) Design and Installation. (A) A bicycle parking space must be in a paved, level, drained, lighted area with access to a right-of-way without the use of stairs, and consist of either: (i) One side of a securely fixed rack element that supports the bicycle upright by its frame, prevents the bicycle from tipping over, and allows the frame and at least one wheel to be locked to the rack element with one lock; or (ii) For Class 1 long-term parking only, a bicycle locker constructed of theft-resistant material with a lockable door that opens to the full width and height of the locker. Bicycle lockers must be weather-proof if exposed to the elements; or (iii) For Class 1 long-term bicycle parking only, wall-mounted racks or wall- or ceiling-mounted hooks so that bicycles may be hung vertically. (B) Each bicycle parking space shall be no less than 15 inches wide, by six feet deep, with an overhead clearance of no less than seven feet. This can be satisfied by placing racks, each of which supports two bicycles, 30 inches apart. (C) Each row of bicycle parking spaces shall be served by an aisle no less than four feet wide. Rack elements must be placed two feet from walls, fences or curbs. (D) Required bicycle parking may not be tandem; parking or removing a bicycle shall not require moving another parked bicycle. (E) Bicycle rack elements shall be fixed, securely anchored to the ground or to a structure by means that resist tampering or removal. Bicycle locker edges shall be secured with no exposed fittings or connectors. The Director may specify preferred installation methods, such as, but not limited to, embedded mounting in poured-in-place concrete, recessed bolt heads or grouted-in anchoring.

(3) Large. Large loading spaces must have a width of no less than 12 feet, a length of no less than 50 feet, and a vertical clearance of no less than 14 feet.
(c) Modifications. In approving a project, the Director or the Planning Commission, as the case may be, may modify the number and size of loading spaces required because of the nature of the use or the design of the project.
(d) Maneuvering Areas. All off-street loading spaces must be designed and located so that there is sufficient off-street maneuvering area to accommodate vehicles using the loading spaces. Maneuvering areas must be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle intended to use the loading spaces and may not be encumbered by parking stalls or physical obstructions.
(e) Surface and Maintenance. Loading spaces and the maneuvering areas and driveways serving them must be paved and maintained with concrete, asphalt, or similar material of sufficient thickness and consistency to support anticipated traffic volumes and weights; properly graded for drainage; and maintained in good condition free of weeds, dust, trash, and debris.
(f) Location. Loading spaces must be located on the same lot on which the use for which they are required is located, except that, upon the granting of a conditional use permit, loading spaces may be provided in a common loading area serving multiple adjacent uses and located on an adjacent lot within 300 feet of the lot on which the use requiring the loading spaces is located. To grant such a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission must make the following findings in addition to the findings otherwise required:
(1) That the common loading area results in a more efficient design than individual loading areas serving each use separately;
(2) That the total number of loading spaces provided in the common loading area is no less than the number of loading spaces that would be required if the uses served were located in a single facility; and
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-43
(3) That the common loading area will be in place at all times during operation of the principal uses to be served by the loading spaces.
(g) Access to Tenant Spaces Served by Loading Spaces.

(h) Availability and Utilization of Loading Spaces. All loading spaces must be made readily available to pick-up and delivery vehicles during all hours when pick-ups and deliveries are allowed. Owners of property containing such loading spaces must be responsible for advising drivers of pick-up and delivery vehicles of the location and hours of such loading spaces, require drivers to use such loading spaces, and not allow pick-up and delivery vehicles to be loaded in the public right-of-way.
(i) Landscaping and Screening. All loading spaces and the maneuvering areas and driveways serving them must be landscaped and screened as required by this section.
(j) Lighting. All exterior loading spaces and the maneuvering areas and driveways serving them must be provided with lighting meeting the minimums established for parking areas.
31.6.10 Alternative Compliance with Parking Requirements
(a) Alternative Parking and Loading Plan. Where an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that variations in the standards or dimensions otherwise required by this section are warranted for uses with unique needs, an alternative parking area design and loading plan may be allowed with approval of a conditional use permit. To grant such a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission must make the following findings in addition to the findings otherwise required:
(1) That the applicant has convincingly demonstrated that the alternative plan is a superior solution and the requested modifications in the design standards are warranted; and
(2) That the alternative parking arrangement will be in place at all times during operation of the principal uses to be served by the parking.
(b) Access and Parking In-Lieu Fees. As an alternative to providing off-street parking on-site, or off-site as allowed by subsection 31.6.5 above, project applicants may propose to pay a fee in-lieu to fund public access and parking improvements for all or a portion of the required parking. This optional Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee is intended to enable the City to (1) acquire sites for and develop off-street public parking, or to lease unused, or underutilized private parking for public use to accommodate auto access and vehicle storage demand that cannot be addressed either on site, or on-street in the vicinity of the project, or (2) to fund transportation demand management programs and services, and/or public transportation, bicycle, and/or pedestrian facilities and services, as necessary to accommodate an equivalent number of person trips to the site.
The fee shall be established by the City Council and administered by the Community Development Director on a per vehicle trip basis, such that the developer of a
City of Belmont Zoning Ordinance
31-44
nonresidential project contributes toward the provision of parking or non-auto facilities and services accommodating the same number of person trips to the site as would have been accommodated by the provision of the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 31-4, as adjusted by other provisions of this section.
The Director shall determine the vehicle trip generation rate for each land use or site seeking to use the Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee option with reference to the vehicle trip generation rates published in the latest edition of the Institute for Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual, with adjustments for mixing of uses, density of population and employment, and proximity to frequent transit service.
(c) Administration of In-Lieu Fee. An Access and Parking in-lieu fee shall be provided for nonresidential uses only as follows:
(1) Parking In-Lieu Fee Amount. The amount of the parking in-lieu fee shall be as set forth in the Citys Master Fee Schedule, and, for projects that would otherwise have to provide 20 or more spaces, the Director shall have the right to determine whether to accept payment of the fee for all or only a portion of the required parking.
(2) Deposit of Funds. Parking in-lieu fees shall be deposited with the City before issuance of a building permit in a separate fund to be known as the Access and Parking In-Lieu Fee Fund and shall be used only as described in this section.
(3) Refund of Fee. A parking in-lieu fee may be refunded, without interest, to the person who made such payment, or his or her assignee or designee, if additional off-street parking spaces are provided for such building or use by others than the City, so as to satisfy the parking requirement for which the in-lieu payment was made. To obtain a refund, the required off-street parking spaces must be in place prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy and before funds are spent or committed by the City.
