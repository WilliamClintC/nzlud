or the action is required, or the failure to do the action is declared to be
unlawful; and where no specific penalty is specifically provided for
violation of the statutes of the ordinances of the city or this code, then
the person or party committing such violation shall be guilty of an
infraction with fines pursuant to Government Code § 36900.

first violation may be prosecuted by the city as a misdemeanor with a fine

   No person shall be arrested for a violation of any provision of any
ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation adopted by the city, the violation
of which is an infraction, except as provided in this section. Proceedings
for the violation of any such provision which constitutes an infraction may

in duplicate, a written notice to appear in court, containing the name and
address of the person against whom the offense is charged, the offense
charged, and the time and place when such person shall appear in court. Such
notice, except as otherwise provided in this section, shall substantially
conform to the provisions of the Penal Code of the state respecting notices
to appear insofar as the same are applicable to infractions. The time
specified in the notice to appear must be at least ten (10) days after the
notice is personally served upon the person charged with the offense. The
place specified in the notice to appear shall be before the judge at the
Butte County Consolidated Court in Oroville, CA. The enforcing officer shall
cause to be personally served one (1) copy of the notice to appear on the
person charged with the offense. The duplicate copy of the notice to appear
shall, as soon as practicable after service of the same, be filed with the
clerk of the court, containing an affidavit of personal service.



   B.   Should the person charged fail to appear at the time specified
in the notice to appear, such failure, if willful, shall constitute a
misdemeanor, regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he or she
has to appear. The person charged may thereafter be arrested, not only upon
such misdemeanor, but upon the charges upon which he or she failed to appear,
as though the same were misdemeanors, and in regard to such arrest, such
person shall be subject to all procedures for arrest contained in this
chapter which are applicable to misdemeanors.

provisions of the ordinances, resolutions and rules and regulations regularly

this chapter, violations of which are misdemeanors, and also to an offense
declared by state law to be a misdemeanor.

   If any person is arrested for violation of any section of any
resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation adopted by the city, or an offense
declared by state law to be a misdemeanor, and such person is not immediately
taken before a magistrate, as more fully set forth in the Penal Code of the
state, the arresting officer shall prepare, in duplicate, a written notice to
appear in court, containing the name and address of such person, the offense
charged and the time and place when such person shall appear in court. Such
notices, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, shall substantially
conform to, and the arresting officer shall act in accordance with, the
provisions of Penal Code Sections 853.5 through 853.85 and Section 853.9.



(Ord. 791-2010 (part), 2010)



1.08.050  Time to appear.



   The time specified in the notice to appear, unless waived by the
person, must be at least ten (10) days after the arrest.



(Ord. 791-2010 (part), 2010)



1.08.060  Place to appear.



   The place specified in the notice to appear shall be either:



   A.   Before a judge of the justice court in the judicial district in
which the city is located in which the offense charged is alleged to have
been committed, who has jurisdiction of the offense, and who is nearest and
most accessible with reference to the place where the arrest is made;



   B.   Upon demand of the person arrested, before a judge having
jurisdiction in the judicial district in which the offense is alleged to have
been committed; or



   C.   Before an officer authorized by the city or the judge of the
judicial district in which the city is located to receive a deposit of bail.



(Ord. 791-2010 (part), 2010)



1.08.070  Delivery of notice--promise to appear.



   The officer shall deliver one copy of the notice to appear to the
arrested person. An arrested person, in order to secure release, must give
his or her written promise so to appear in court by signing the duplicate
notice, which shall be retained by the officer. Thereupon, the arresting
officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody.

   The officer shall, as soon as practicable, file the duplicate notice
and underlying police reports in support of the charge or charges with the
prosecuting attorney. Within twenty-five (25) days from the time of arrest
the prosecutor, within his or her discretion, may initiate prosecution by
filing the notice or a formal complaint with the magistrate specified
therein. If the prosecution is not to be initiated, the prosecutor shall send
notice to the person arrested at the address on the notice to appear.
Thereupon the magistrate may fix the amount of bail which, in his or her
judgment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1275 of the Penal
Code, will be reasonable and sufficient for the appearance of the defendant
and shall indorse upon the notice a statement signed by him or her in the
form set forth in Section 815a of the Penal Code. The defendant may, prior to
the date upon which he or she promised to appear in court, deposit with the
magistrate the amount of bail thus set. Thereafter, at the time when the case
is called for arraignment before the magistrate, if the defendant shall not
appear, either in person or by counsel, the magistrate may declare the bail
forfeited, and may in his or her discretion order that no further proceedings
shall be had in such case.

the state, the magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a
warrant for his or her arrest (A) within twenty (20) days after his or her
failure to appear as promised, or (B) if such person promises to appear
before an officer authorized to accept bail, other than a magistrate, and
fails to do so on or before the date upon which he or she promised to appear,
then within twenty (20) days after delivery of such written promise to appear
by the officer to the magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense.

1.09.010  Purpose.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for an administrative civil
penalty procedure for the protection, health, safety, and general public
welfare of the residents of the City of Gridley and to preserve the
livability, appearance, property values, and social and economic stability of
the City of Gridley by providing an alternative method of code enforcement to
effect abatement of violations of the codes and ordinances identified in the
Gridley Municipal Code.



(Ord. 791-2010 (part), 2010)



1.09.020  Scope.



   This chapter relates to the administrative assessment of civil
penalties for violations of the Gridley Municipal Code. Civil penalties
established by this chapter are established by ordinance and in addition to
any other administrative or legal remedy, or enforcement fees which may be
pursued by the City of Gridley to address violations of the codes and
ordinances identified in the Gridley Municipal Code.  In lieu of the
procedures to assess civil penalties administratively, the City Attorney may,
by appropriate action, seek to assess civil penalties in addition to any
other remedies available to the city.  Such penalties may be assessed from
the date of the first violation until the violation is corrected.  Each day
a violation exists is a separate violation resulting in a separate
administrative penalty.

Specifically, there shall be assessed an administrative penalty not exceeding
one hundred dollars ($100) for a first violation of the same ordinance within
one (1) year and an administrative penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars
($200) for a second violation of the same ordinance within one (1) year and
an administrative penalty not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500) for each
additional violation of the same ordinance within one (1) year.  Each day
shall be a separate violation.  Not withstanding the foregoing, for a
violation of Model California Building Codes and the California Fire Code,
there shall be an administrative penalty not exceeding one hundred dollars
($100) for a first violation of the same ordinance within one (1) year and an
administrative penalty not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500) for a second
violation within one (1) year and an administrative penalty not exceeding one

the violation nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the city.



   E.   The failure of any person to pay a penalty assessed by
administrative citation within the time specified on the citation shall
result in the assessment of a late fee. The amount of the late fee shall be
one hundred percent (100%) of the total amount of the administrative penalty
owed.



   F.   A civil penalty assessed by administrative citation constitutes
a debt to the city. In the event any person fails to pay a civil penalty
within the time specified, the city may take such action as is appropriate to
collect the debt, including, but not limited to an action in small claims
court, an assessment lien, or any other legal remedy.

collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure
and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary real property taxes.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of real property
taxes are applicable to the special assessment.



   B.   The city may also cause a notice of lien to be recorded. The
notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of the
real property, set forth the last known address of the record owner or
possessor, the date on which the penalty was imposed, a description of the
real property subject to the lien, and the amount of the penalty.

   1.10.010   Right of entry procedures.



1.10.010  Right of entry procedures.



   A.   Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any
ordinance, resolution, or code, or whenever there is reasonable cause to
believe that there exists a violation of any provision of such ordinance,
resolution or code, any authorized official of the city may, upon
presentation of proper credentials, enter such building or premises at all
reasonable times to inspect the same and to perform any duty imposed upon
such official by any provision of such ordinance, resolution or code. The
official shall give notice as follows:



      1.   The authorized official shall contact the owner or
occupant of the premises, present proper identifying credentials, then
request entry within a reasonable time.



      2.   If the authorized official locates the owner or occupant
but the owner or occupant is outside of the city, the authorized official may
notify such person by telephone or by letter, and in doing so, shall transmit
proper identifying credentials and may request entry.



      3.   In the event that entry within a reasonable time is
refused by the occupant, the owner, or such other person having charge or
control of the building or premises, or in the event of the inability of the
authorized official, after making a reasonable effort to locate the owner, or
other person having charge of control of the building or premises so as to
request entry, then the authorized official shall be empowered to seek and is
entitled to obtain an appropriate inspection warrant or such other available
remedy provided by law to secure entry to such building or premises.  The
city may elect to seek judicial enforcement and to oppose administrative
penalties by appropriate legal action.  Should the city elect judicial
enforcement, the administrative provisions of this chapter are not required
(due process will be obtained through the court system).



   B.   "Entry within a reasonable time" is deemed to be entry within a
reasonable time under the circumstances existing at the time of request, not
exceeding twenty-four (24) hours from the time of the request.



   C.   "Authorized official," as used in this section, refers to any
official of the city, their deputies, assistants and authorized employees who
are charged with the enforcement of a particular provision of any ordinance,
resolution, or technical codes adopted by ordinance.



   D.   The remedies provided by this chapter are cumulative and not
exclusive.

Chapter 2.32 Closed Session Council Meetings



   2.32.010   Unauthorized disclosure of closed session matters.



   2.32.020   False or misleading disclosure of closed session matters.



   2.32.030   Violation.



   2.32.040   Liability for damages.



   2.32.050   Definition.



   2.32.060   Legislative intent and interpretation.



2.32.010  Unauthorized disclosure of closed session matters.



   It shall be unlawful for any present or former member of the City
Council of the City of Gridley to disclose or otherwise discuss with any
person, any fact or other matter which was discussed or which occurred in a
closed session meeting of the City Council of the City of Gridley. The
prohibition of disclosure contained in this section shall not apply to a
communication to any person who was present during the closed session. 



(Ord. 562 § 1, 1990)



2.32.020  False or misleading disclosure of closed session matters.



   It shall be unlawful for any present or former member of the City
Council of the City of Gridley to disclose to any person that any fact or
other matter was considered in closed session of the City Council of the City
of Gridley even though such fact or matter was not actually discussed by the
City Council in closed session. This section shall be read in conjunction
with Section 2.32.010 so as to prohibit disclosure of both facts and matters
actually discussed and considered by the City Council in closed session and
to prohibit disclosure of false and untrue statements regarding facts or
other matters considered by the City Council in closed session. 



(Ord. 562 § 1, 1990)



2.32.030  Violation.



   A.   Any person violating any of the provisions of Section 2.32.010
or Section 2.32.020, or both, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor pursuant to
the provisions of Sections 1.08.010 and 1.08.030 of this code. Any person who
was previously convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendre in reference to a
prior violation of Section 2.32.010 or Section 2.32.020, or both, shall be
prosecuted for a misdemeanor violation on a second or a subsequent violation
and cannot be charged with an infraction of such violation.



   B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a violation of
this Section 2.32.030 if, prior to disclosure of information proscribed by
this chapter, the Council Member or former Council Member obtains, from the
City Council of the City of Gridley, by the affirmative vote of at least 3 of
the Council Members, permission to make the disclosure of information
otherwise prohibited by this chapter.



(Ord. 562 § 1, 1990)



2.32.040  Liability for damages.



   Notwithstanding whether a person has been criminally charged pursuant
to Section 2.32.020 of this chapter, any person who makes the disclosures
prohibited in Sections 2.32.010 and 2.32.020, or both, shall be liable to the
City of Gridley for all damages which the city establishes were proximately
caused by the unauthorized disclosures, said damages to be established in the
same manner as obligations upon a contract are determined. The liability
called for in this section shall not apply if the person who makes the
disclosures prohibited by this chapter first obtains permission from the City
Council of the City of Gridley consisting of the affirmative vote of not less
than 3 members of the City Council. Nothing in this Chapter 2.32 or in this
Section shall be construed to limit any liability to the City of Gridley for
which a person might otherwise be responsible, notwithstanding the provisions
of this Chapter.



(Ord. 562 § 1, 1990)



2.32.050  Definition.



   As used in this Chapter, "closed session" shall refer to any meeting of
the City Council of the City of Gridley, or of some of its members which are
not open and public, but rather closed sessions pursuant to any then
applicable provision of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code 54590 et.
seq.). It shall not be a defense to a violation specified in Section 2.32.030
or to a claim for damages under Section 2.32.040 that the particular closed
session was improper or not authorized pursuant to the Ralph M. Brown Act
provided that the City Council met in closed session ostensibly under the
auspices of the Ralph M. Brown Act, whether or not such session was properly
a "closed session” under the Act, unless it is first established through
appropriate legal proceedings that a particular closed session was improper
and not authorized pursuant to the Ralph M. Brown Act (i.e., a defense will
not exist unless the validity of the particular closed session is legally
established prior to any disclosures concerning that particular closed
session). 



(Ord. 562 § 1, 1990)



2.32.060  Legislative intent and interpretation.



   A.   It is the intent of the City Council of the City of Gridley
that the provisions of this Chapter 2.32 be read in conjunction with existing
law insofar as any proceedings under which a person is legally obligated and
required to give testimony may do so without a violation of this Chapter.
Specifically, Government Code § 54953.1 provides that the provisions of the
Ralph M. Brown Act shall not be construed to prohibit members of the
legislative body of a local agency from giving testimony in private, before a
grand jury, either as individuals or as a body. To the extent that this or
any similar provision of law requires the testimony of a person affected by
this Chapter, a person may give such testimony and not be in violation of the
provisions of this Chapter.



   B.   Furthermore, this Chapter 2.32 shall be interpreted and
construed so as to preserve the Civil Rights of those affected by this
Chapter, particularly the rights of freedom of association, and freedom of
speech, provided that the topics and information concerning closed sessions
of the City Council of the City of Gridley in which such information would
only be imparted in closed session and would not otherwise be information
generally available to a person charged with violation of this Chapter. In
that regard, violations under this Chapter shall be interpreted in a fashion
similar to the statutory framework with reference to the commission on
teacher credentialing wherein the meetings of the commission are normally
open to members of the public under Education Code 44231, however, under
Education Code 44245, meetings and hearings of the commission to consider the
suspension or revocation of credentials shall be held in executive and closed
session and under Education Code 44248 (a), any member of the commission who
releases or gives out information at a meeting held pursuant to 44245 is
guilty of a misdemeanor. That is to say that the interpretation of this
Chapter 2.32 shall be construed to place limitations upon present and former
members of the Gridley City Council similar to those limitations placed upon
members of the commission on teacher credentialing insofar as the law
requires confidentiality with respect to executive sessions of the commission.



   C.   Additionally, this Chapter 2.32 shall be interpreted in such a
fashion that there will be no violation deemed in those instances when the
City Council has, by the affirmative vote of three or more of its members,
determined that an issue previously the topic of discussion in closed session
has reached a stage where public disclosure and discussion is warranted and
appropriate. Additionally, this chapter shall be construed and interpreted to
permit discussion of matters known generally from independent public sources
of information even though those matters might have been discussed in closed
session, so long as any discussion shall not in any way suggest or assert
that such public matters were discussed in closed session.

2.34.020 Determination of matters to be disclosed by consultant.



   The City Administrator may determine in writing that a particular
consultant is hired to perform a range of duties that is limited in scope and
thus is not required to fully comply with the disclosure requirements in this
Chapter. Such written determination shall include a description of the
consultant’s duties and, based upon that description, a statement of the
extent of disclosure requirements. The City Administrator’s determination
is a public record and shall be retained for public inspection in the same
manner and location as the City’s municipal Code. 



(Ord. 613 § 1, 1992).



2.34.030  Disclosure requirement for consultants.

reasonably foreseeable that said decision might materially affect the

is adopted to achieve the following, among other, purposes, and directs that

   A.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code;



   B.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates
provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state
insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and
limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code;



   C.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the
State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and
Use Taxes;



   D.   To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be
administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with
the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation code,
minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time
minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under
the provisions of this chapter.

   Prior to January 1, 1974, this city shall contract with the State Board
of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and
operation of this chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have
contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to January 1, 1974, it
shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case, January 1, 1974, shall be
the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a
contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following
the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 



(Ord. 266-A § 5, 1974).



3.12.050  Statutory provisions--adoption.

part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State
Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the
Constitution of the state of California; the substitution shall not be made
when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or
against the city, or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State
Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be
made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the
substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to
certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal
property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales,
storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under
the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or
to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other
consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax
by the state under the provisions of that Code; the substitution shall not be
made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711,
6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the
substitution shall not be made for the word "State" in the phrase "retailer
engaged in business in this State" in Section 6203 or in the definition of

   E.   Award of Contracts. Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, contracts shall be awarded by the city council to the lowest
responsible bidder. The city may award the contract to other bidders than the

amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public
interest will not permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the city
council may, in its discretion, accept the one it chooses or accept the
lowest bid made by and after negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of
the bid opening.



   G.   Performance Bonds. The city council shall have the authority to

agent, shall solicit bids from prospective vendors by written request, by
telephone or by public notice posted on the public bulletin board in city

(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.020 Necessity, authority, and purpose.



   A.   The City Council (the "Council") of the City of Gridley (the
"City") hereby determines as follows:



      1.   That the cost to maintain satisfactory levels of health
care at local health care facilities, including the Biggs-Gridley Memorial
Hospital, is greater than those facilities receive.



      2.   Absent supplemental funding by the citizens of Gridley,
the local health care facilities including the Biggs-Gridley Memorial
Hospital may be forced to close.



      3.   Closure of the local health care facilities would
constitute a detriment of and to the health, welfare and safety of the
citizens of the city.



      4.   That the levy of a city-wide special tax as hereinafter
provided is necessary to provide funding to maintain the local health care
facilities and services.



   B.   This ordinance will become effective as stated in § 3.30.160,
provided, however, that the taxes provided in this chapter shall become
effective when approved by the voters of the city.  An election seeking such
voter approval has been consolidated with the State General Election to be
held on November 7, 2006.  The taxes imposed by this chapter shall become
effective provided that the voters (by a two-thirds vote of the voters voting
at the election) approve the imposition of the taxes specified in this
chapter.  Upon the certification that the taxes called for in this chapter
were approved by a two-thirds vote of the voters voting at the November 7,
2006, election, the taxes specified in this chapter shall be due and payable
as provided herein and the City of Gridley Local Health Facilities and
Services Parcel Tax (the "Tax") shall be levied based upon all applicable
law. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.030  Tax levied.



   A.   The tax not exceeding the maximum amount set forth in this
section is hereby levied, commencing in the fiscal year 2006-2007, on all
taxable properties within the boundaries of the city at the maximum flat rate
of seventy dollars ($70.00) per Single-Family Equivalent Residential Unit
(ERU).  For the purposes of defining an Equivalent Residential Unit, the
following categories are established:



      1.   Single-family residential (1);



      2.   Multi-family residential unit (.75 per each unit of the
multi-unit complex);



      3.   Condominium (.75 per each condominium unit);



      4.   For mixed uses, such as commercial and residential, the
tax shall be based upon the residential units existing on such parcel as
specified above.



      5.   Vacant parcels shall not be subject to the tax.



   B.   For purposes of this chapter, "taxable" properties are those
not owned by the city, the State of California, any other public district or
agency of the State or the United States of America. 



   C.   The tax shall not exceed the maximum amount set forth in this
section, except that the tax may be increased annually by the annual percent
increase for the prior calendar year, if any, by the percentage equal to the
percentage change in the Construction Engineering Index for the geographic
area most applicable for the preceding twelve (12) month period calculated
from April 1 to March 31.  If this index should cease publication, the City
Administrator shall use any appropriate official index published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor, or similar agency as may then exist
or may then may be most nearly equivalent thereto.



   D.   If approved by the voters, the special tax shall continue until
repealed by the City Council or by the voters, or on July 1, 2017, at which
time the taxes imposed by this chapter shall cease. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.040  Purposes and uses of tax.



   The proceeds of the tax shall be deposited in a special fund,
maintained by the city, which proceeds, together with any interest and
penalties thereon, collected each fiscal year (collectively, the "Tax
Proceeds,"), shall be used for maintenance of local health care.  The city
may transfer the tax proceeds to another public entity for the same
purpose.  The city shall direct and oversee the expenditure of the tax
proceeds. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.050 Exemptions.



   A.   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be subject to the
exemptions set forth in this section.



   B.   Low-Income Homeowner Exemption.  Exempt from this tax are
owners of single-family residential units in which they reside whose combined
family income, from all sources for the previous calendar year, is at or
below the income level qualifying as "very low-income" for a family of such
size under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S C.A.
Sections 1437 et seq.], for such year. The application process will be in the
form of self-certification under penalty of perjury. Owners must apply for
the exemption provided for in this section annually by petition to the
Finance Director of the City in the manner and at the time set forth by the
Finance Director.  Such petitions shall be on forms provided by the Finance
Director and shall provide such information as the Finance Director may
require. If the Finance Director determines the need to audit an application,
the Finance Director  may require additional information, including, but not
limited to, federal income tax returns and W-2 forms of owner-occupants
eligible for this exemption. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.060 Computation and collection of tax.



   The city's Finance Director or his/her designee or employee is hereby
authorized and directed each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year
2006-2007, to determine the tax amount to be levied for the next ensuing
fiscal year for each taxable parcel of real property within the city, in the
manner and as provided in § 3.30.030. The Finance Director is hereby
authorized and directed to provide all necessary information to the
auditor/tax collector of the County of Butte to effect proper billing and
collection of the tax, so that the installments of the tax shall be included
on the secured property tax roll of the County of Butte.  Unless otherwise
required by the Council, no Council action shall be required to authorize the
annual collection of the tax as herein provided. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.070 Accountability.



   Pursuant to Sections 50075.1 and 50075.3 of the California Government
Code, the specific purposes of the tax and the requirement that the tax
proceeds be applied to such purposes and the establishment of a special fund
for the tax proceeds are as set forth in § 3.30.030.  So long as the tax is
collected hereunder, commencing no later than July l, 2007, or as soon
thereafter after said tax may be levied, the Finance Director is hereby
authorized and directed to cause to be prepared and filed with the Council a
report that shows the amount of tax collected and expended and the status of
any projects funded with the tax proceeds.  For purposes of this section,
the Finance Director is authorized to retain such consultants, accountants or
agents as may be necessary or convenient to accomplish the foregoing. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.080 Examination of books and records and annual audit.



   The Finance Director or his/her designee or employee or agent, is
hereby authorized and directed to examine assessment rolls, property tax
records, records of the Butte County Recorder and any other records of the
County of Butte deemed necessary in order to determine ownership of parcels
and computation of the tax. A certified public accounting firm retained by
the city will perform an annual audit to assure accountability of the proper
disbursement of these tax proceeds in accordance with the objectives stated
herein. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.090 Property tax.



   This special tax is a property tax and qualified property owners and
renters shall be entitled to the benefits of California Revenue and Taxation
Code Section 20501 et seq. and the Senior Citizens and Disabled Property Tax
Postponement Law (California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 20581 et
seq.), as provided by law. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.100 Collection of tax: interest and penalties.



   The tax shall be collected in the same manner as ordinary ad valorem
taxes are collected and shall have the same lien priority, and be subject to
the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in cases of delinquency as
provided for ad valorem taxes collected by the County of Butte; provided,
however, that the Council may provide for other appropriate methods of
collection of the tax by appropriate resolution(s) of the Council. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.110 [Reserved].



3.30.120 Refund of tax, penalty, or interest paid more than once, or
erroneously or illegally collected.



   When the amount of the tax, any penalty, or any interest has been paid
more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by
the city under this section, it may be refunded, provided a verified claim,
in writing, therefore, stating the specific ground(s) upon which claim is
founded, is filed with the Finance Director within one (l) year from the date
of payment.  If the claim is approved by the Finance Director, the excess
amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited against any
amounts then due and payable from the person from whom it was collected or by
whom paid, and the balance may be refunded to such person, his/her
administrators or executors. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.130 Savings clause.



   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any person, or to any
property as to whom or which it is beyond the power of the City to impose the
tax herein provided. If any provision, sentence, clause, section or part of
this section is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall affect only such
provision, sentence, clause, section or part of this section and shall not
affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses,
sections or parts of this section.  It is hereby declared to be the
intention of the city that this section would have been adopted had such
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid provision, sentence, clause, section or
part thereof not been included herein. 



(Ord. 760, 2006).



3.30.140 Regulations.

   This chapter shall be known as the "Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax
Ordinance of the City of Gridley."



3.40.020  Definitions.



   For the purposes of interpreting this chapter, the following
definitions are intended to be controlling:



   A.   City: The City of Gridley, a municipal corporation and City
within the State of California.



   B.   Day: Unless otherwise specified, means calendar day.



   C.   Delinquency: The failure to do any act required to be done
pursuant to this chapter, at the time required by this chapter.



   D.   Lodging: Any building, portion of a building, reserved outdoor
space, or other premises or area rented for use by transients for overnight
accommodations. A "lodging" shall refer to the following premises, including
but not limited to: Motel, hotel, inn, tourist home, bed and breakfast,
rooming house, apartment house, mobilehome park, recreational vehicle park,
campground, or parking area.



   E.   Occupancy: The use, or the right to use, any lodging.



   F.   Operator: The person who is proprietor of the lodging whether
in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession,
licensee, or in any other capacity. Where the operator performs his function
through a managing agent of any type or character other than that of an
employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed to be an operator for
purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as
his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the
principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be
compliance by both.



   G.   Person: A natural person acting as an individual or sole
proprietorship, or any group or combination of natural persons, or any
business entity such as a partnership, joint venture, association, club,
corporation, trust, syndicate or other form of entity.



   H.   Rent: Any fee, charge, or other valuable consideration received
by an operator as gross proceeds paid by a transient (defined below) for
lodging. The "rent" shall be valued in money, whether it is received in money
or in kind goods or services. "Rent" shall include all services of any kind
or nature prior to any deduction for any reason whatever.



   I.   Tax: The transient occupancy tax imposed by this chapter.



   J.   Tax collector: The City Clerk of the City of Gridley or the
Clerk’s designee.



   K.   Transient: Any person having occupancy or a lodging for a
period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less regardless of the
form of agreement, license, permit or entitlement. Any person actually
occupying a lodging shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of
thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing, between
the operator and occupant, providing for a longer period of occupancy.



3.40.030  Tax imposed; amount of tax.



   For the privilege of occupying a lodging within the City, each
transient shall pay a tax in the amount of six percent (6%) of the rent
charged by the operator. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the
transient to the City and that debt can be satisfied only by payment in full
to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the
operator at the time that the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in
installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each
installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s termination
of the lodging. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of
the lodging, the tax collector may require that such tax be paid directly to
the tax collector.



3.40.040  Exemptions.



   A.   No tax shall be imposed upon any person as to whom, or any
occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the City to impose the tax
herein provided.



   B.   No tax shall be imposed upon the occupants of a hotel, nor
shall the provisions of this article apply to the owner or operator of a
hotel that has had issued to it a "nontransient occupancy registration
certificate" by the tax collector, as authorized by Section 3.40.070.



3.40.050  Duties of operator.



   Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same
extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient.
The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent
charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the
rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner
hereinafter provided.



3.40.060  Transient occupancy registration certificate.



   Within ten (10) days after commencing business, each operator of the
lodging, located within the City, who rents occupancies to transients, shall
register the lodging with the tax collector. The tax collector shall provide
the operator with a "transient occupancy resignation certificate" which shall
be posted at all times in a conspicuous place at the lodging. The certificate
shall include, but is not limited to, the following information:



   A.   The name of the operator;



   B.   The address of the lodging;



   C.   The date upon which the certificate was issued;



   D.   The following statement: "This transient occupancy registration
certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled
the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance by
registering with the tax collector for the purposes of collecting from
transients the transient occupancy tax, and remitting said tax to the tax
collector. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any
unlawful business, to conduct any lawful business in any unlawful manner, or
to operate a lodging without strict compliance with all local applicable
laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board,
commission, department, or office of this City. The certificate does not
constitute a permit."



3.40.070  Nontransient occupancy registration certificate.



   When the information furnished to the tax collector as required by
Section 3.40.060 establishes that the operator of the hotel is in the
business of renting to nontransients, the tax collector shall issue to the
operator a "nontransient occupancy registration certificate". Such
certificate shall be in the form of a stamped impression placed upon the
operator’s business license certificate by the tax collector containing the
words "nontransient occupancy registration certificate" with such additional
legend in words or numerals as the tax collector shall determine necessary to
give appropriate notice to hotel guests that the licensee has complied with
the registration requirements of this chapter.



3.40.080  Reports and remittances.



   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the tax collector, make a return to the
tax collector, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and
received, and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the
time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be
remitted to the tax collector. The tax collector may establish shorter
reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in
order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information
in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of
business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this
chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment
thereof is made to the tax collector.



3.40.090  Penalties and interest.



   A.   Late registrations. Any operator who shall fail to obtain a
registration certificate within the time specified by this chapter shall pay
a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) per certificate.



   B.   Original delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax
imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten
percent (10%) of the amount of tax in addition to the amount of the tax.



   C.   Continued delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any
delinquent remittances on or before a period of thirty (30) days following
the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second
delinquency penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of tax in addition to
the amount of tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.



   D.   Fraud. If the tax collector determines that the nonpayment of
any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty
five percent (25%) of the amount of tax shall be added thereto in addition to
the penalties stated in subparagraphs B and C of this section.



   E.   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent (1%) per month, or a fraction thereof, on the amount of
the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid. If the last of any month falls on a Saturday,
Sunday, or legal holiday, the additional one percent (1%) shall attach after
5:00 p.m. on the next business day.



   F.   Penalties and interests merged with tax. Every penalty imposed
and such interest as accrues, pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall become part of the tax required to be paid by the provisions of this
chapter.



3.40.100  Failure of operator to report tax.



   A.   Tax collector to estimate tax due. In the event any operator
fails or refuses to collect the tax imposed by this chapter, or to make,
within the time provided in this chapter, any required report or any payment
of the tax or any portion of the tax required by this chapter, the tax
collector may make an estimate of the tax due. In making the estimate, the
tax collector shall proceed in the manner the tax collector deems appropriate
to attain facts and information on which to base an estimate of the tax due.
In the absence of information which the tax collector deems most appropriate,
it shall be deemed appropriate for the tax collector to estimate the tax by
multiplying the number of days in the reporting period by the estimated
number of lodging units customarily available from rent by the operator and
then multiplying such result and number by the estimated average rent for the
subject lodging units or similar lodging units and thereafter multiplying
that result and the number by the tax rate. The foregoing shall not limit the
tax collector in estimating the tax due but if utilized shall in and of
itself be deemed reasonable.



   B.   Notice of tax due. The tax collector shall proceed to determine
and assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties due as
provided by this chapter. The tax collector shall give a notice of the amount
so assessed by mail or personal service addressed to all persons so assessed,
at their last known addresses.



   C.   Tax is final if hearing not requested. The operator may make
application in writing to the tax collector for hearing on the amount
assessed within ten (10) calendar days after personal service of any notice
of taxes, or within fifteen (15) days from the date of mailing of any notice
of taxes due. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within
the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by
the tax collector shall become final and conclusive and shall be immediately
due and payable.



3.40.110  Appeals process.



   A.   Hearing and dispute resolution. In the event an operator
applies for a hearing within the time prescribed, the tax collector shall
give at least fifteen (15) days written notice to the operator of the time
and place of the hearing by mail or at least ten (10) days notice if by
personal service. Such hearing may be held at any time within sixty (60) days
of receipt of application of the hearing by the tax collector. At the
hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax,
interest, or penalties should not be so established.



   B.   Determination of tax. Within thirty (30) days after the
hearing, the tax collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and
shall give written notice to the person by personal service or certified mail
of the determination and amount of tax, interests and penalties. The total
due shall be payable fifteen (15) days from mailing or serving of notice
unless an appeal is made as provided in sub-section 3.40.110 C.



   C.   Appeal from initial hearing. Any operator aggrieved by any
decision of the tax collector with respect to the amount of such tax,
interests, and penalties, if any, may appeal to the City Council by filing a
notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days of the serving
or mailing of the determination of tax due. The City Council shall fix a time
and place for hearing such appeal and the City Clerk shall give notice in
writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of
the City Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the
appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.
Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon receipt
of the notice. No appeal may be taken without first having completed the
initial hearing process set forth in subparts A and B.



   D.   Limitation of issues on appeal. The issues on appeal shall be
limited to:



      1.   Operator named do the tax bill is not correct.



      2.   Estimated tax is based on incorrect number of units.



      3.   Estimated tax is based on incorrect lodging rates.



      4.   Estimated tax is based on incorrect occupancy rates.



   E.   Payment of tax a condition of appeal. After the determination
of amount of tax due from any operator has been made following an initial
hearing as specified in subpart A above, an operator must pay the taxes
specified in the notice as a condition precedent to filing an appeal. Failure
to pay such tax, together with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall
result in appeal being denied. In the event that it is ultimately determined
that the whole or any part of the tax, interest and penalties was not due,
the operator shall be entitled to a full refund of the amounts paid, but
determined not to be due together with interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per annum. The City may retain without interest those funds ultimately
determined to be due to the City pursuant to this chapter.



3.40.120  Records to be kept for three years.



   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
payment to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine
the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and
payment to the City, which records the tax collector shall have the right to
inspect at all reasonable times.



3.40.130  Refunds.



   A.   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been
overpaid or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as
provided in the subparagraphs B and C or this section; provided, a claim in
writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon
which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax collector within three (3)
years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the
tax collector.



   B.   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
to be collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or
erroneously or illegally collected or received, when it is established in a
manner prescribed by the tax collector that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient to the operator.



   C.   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more
than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subparagraph A of this section, but
only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax collector, or
when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the tax collector that the transient has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax



   D.   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section
unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.



3.40.140  Action to collect.



   Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any
person owing money to the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be
liable to an action brought in the name of the City, in any court of
competent jurisdiction within Butte County, or within the county of residence
of such person, at the option of the tax collector, for the recovery of such
amount.



3.40.150  Recording certificate of lien.



   The tax collector may record a certificate of lien in the Office of the
Butte County Recorder, within three (3) years after the amount required to be
paid to the City under this chapter is not paid when due. The certificate
shall specify the amount of tax, penalties and interest due, the name and
address as it appears on the records of tax collector of the operators liable
for the tax and the fact that the tax collector has complied with all
provisions of this chapter and the determination of the amount required to be
paid. From the time of filing for record, the amount required to be paid
together with penalties and interest constitute a lien upon all real and
personal property in the City owned by the operator or afterwards acquired by
the operator prior to the expiration of the lien. The lien has the force,
effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten (10) years
from the time of filing of their certificate unless sooner released or
otherwise discharged. The lien may be extended for two (2) additional
ten-year periods by re-recording the original lien. The lien may be recorded
in any other county in which the operator may have property.



3.40.160  Priority and lien of tax.



   The amounts required to be paid by any operator under this chapter with
penalties and interest shall be satisfied first in any of the following cases:



   A.   Whenever the person is insolvent;



   B.   Whenever the person makes a voluntary assignment of his/her
assets.



   C.   Whenever the estate of the person in the hands of the
executors, administrators or heirs is insufficient to pay all the debts due
from the deceased.



   D.   Whenever the estate and the effects of an absconding, concealed
or absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied
upon by process of law.



   E.   Whenever a lien recorded hereunder is senior to other claimant
interest.



3.40.170  Tax collector remedies.



   The tax collector may utilize any remedy available for the collection
of taxes to enforce collection of the tax under this chapter, including
seizure and sale (Revenue and Taxation Code Section 2951 et seq.). Any tax
required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter
shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the City. Any such tax
collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall be deemed
a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to the City
under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought by
the tax collector in the name of the City of Gridley, as plaintiff, for the
recovery of the tax, penalties and interests and costs of collection,
including but not limited to, attorneys and City Council fees.



3.40.180  Change in ownership.



   When ownership of a lodging is transferred, the following duties arise.



   A.   Duty of transferor (seller). Prior to a change of ownership of
a lodging, the transferor or operator of the lodging shall given written
notice to the tax collector of the sale no later than fifteen (15) days
before the close of escrow or the transfer of title. The transferor shall
request and complete a final transient occupancy report form and pay upon
close of escrow or upon delivery of title or transfer, whichever first
occurs, all taxes, penalties and interest due in addition to any unsecured
property taxes which are a statutory lien against the transferor.



   B.   Duty of transferee (buyer). Prior to the change in ownership of
a lodging, the transferee or perspective operator of the lodging shall give
written notice to the tax collector of the sale no later than fifteen (15)
days before the close of escrow or the transfer of title. The transferee
shall retain from the purchase price the amount for which the transferor is
liable until the transferor produces a certificate from the tax collector
stating that the taxes have been paid. If the tax is not paid as provided in
this chapter, the tax collector shall request the retained amount from the
transferee. The transferee shall pay the request within ten (10) days.



   C.   Effective notice. If proper notice is given by the parties to
the transfer of ownership of a lodging, an audit may be performed by the tax
collector in order to determine any tax liability of the transferred prior to
the change of ownership. If proper notice was given, the City will release
the transferee from any tax liability of the transferor prior to the change
of ownership. If proper notice was given, the City will release the
transferee from any tax liability arising prior to the change of ownership,
even if no audit was conducted.



   D.   Constructive notice. This section shall be deemed constructive
notice to all new owners of lodgings that they shall assume liability for all
unpaid taxes when the tax collector is not properly notified as set forth in

the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is
guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as set forth in subsection A of
this section.



3.40.200  Civil remedies.



   In addition to any and all other remedies provided herein, the tax
collector may utilize any and all civil remedies available to the tax
collector at law or in equity not otherwise prohibited by law or inconsistent

(Ord. 565, 1990)



5.04.020  License--required.



   A.   There are imposed upon all persons engaged in business in this
city license fees in the amounts prescribed in this title. It is unlawful for
any person, whether as principal or agent, clerk or employee, either for
himself or for any other person, or for anybody corporate, or as officer of
any corporation, or otherwise, to commence to carry on any business set forth
in this chapter in the city, without first having procured a license from the
city so to do or without complying with any and all regulations of such
business contained in this chapter; and the carrying on of any business
mentioned in this chapter without having first procured a license from the
city to do so, or without complying with any and all regulations of such
business, shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter for each and
every day that such business is so carried on.



   B.   The license required to be obtained and the fee required to be
paid are declared to be required pursuant to the taxing power of the city
solely for the purpose of obtaining revenue. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.030  Unlawful business not authorized.



   No license issued under the provisions of this title shall be construed
as authorizing the conduct or continuance of any illegal or unlawful business
or any business in violation of any ordinance of the city. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.040  Application--required.



   Every person required to have a license under the provisions of this
title shall make application for the same, or for renewal of the same, to the
Finance Director of the city. Such application shall be a written statement
signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury. The application shall set
forth such information as may be required therein and as may be reasonably
necessary to properly determine the amount of the license fee to be paid by
the applicant. 



(Ord. 565, 1990)



5.04.050  Application--verification.



   No application shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth therein,
nor shall the filing of the same preclude the city from collecting by
appropriate action such fee as is actually due and payable under this title.
Each application, and all statements and information contained therein, may
be subject to review, audit and verification by the Finance Director, his
deputies or other authorized employees of the city. All licensees, applicants
for licenses and persons engaged in business in the city are required to
permit examination of their books, records and papers for the purposes
aforesaid. The information or data obtained from such examination or audit,
or from any application required under this title, shall be deemed to be
confidential, except that such may be used for the purpose of enforcing the
provisions of this title. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.060  Licenses--issuance.



   A.   It shall be the duty of the Finance Director to prepare and
issue a license under this chapter for every person liable to pay a license
hereunder, and to state in each license the amount thereof, the period of
time covered thereby, and the name of the person to whom issued, the business
licensed and the location or place of business where such business is carried
on.



   B.   In no case shall any mistake by the Finance Director in stating
the amount of a license prevent or prejudice the collection for the city of
what shall be actually due from anyone carrying on a business subject to a
license under this chapter. 



(Ord. 565. 1990).



5.04.070  License fee as debt to city.



   The amount of any license imposed by this chapter shall be deemed a
debt to the city, and any person carrying on any business mentioned in this
chapter without having a license from the city to do so, shall be liable to
an action in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction for
the amount of the license by this chapter imposed on such business. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.080  Term.



   All licenses shall be issued under this title for a period of twelve
(12) months unless specified otherwise. All annual licenses shall expire
December 31st. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.090  License--payment.



   All licenses shall be paid in advance in the legal currency of the
United States, at the office of the Finance Director. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.100  When payable.



   All license fees imposed under this title shall be paid in advance and
annual licenses shall be due and payable on the second day of January of each
year. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.110  Delinquency dates.



   Unless otherwise specifically provided under other provisions of this
title, all continuing business license fees required to be paid under this
title shall be deemed delinquent if not paid by the 31st day of January. For
new businesses commencing after the first day of January, the fee shall
become delinquent thirty days after initial billing. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.120  Delinquency penalty.



   Any person who fails to pay any business license fees required to be
paid by this title within the time required shall pay a penalty of fifty
percent of the amount of the fee in addition to the amount of such fee and
shall pay an additional ten percent of the amount of fee for each month of
continued delinquency after the first month, provided, that the amount of
such penalty shall in no event exceed one hundred percent of the amount of
the business license fee due. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.130  License payment--criminal prosecution.



   The conviction and punishment of any person for transacting any
business without a license shall not excuse or exempt such person from the
payment of any license due or unpaid at the time of such conviction, and
nothing in this chapter shall prevent a criminal prosecution for any
violation of the provisions of this chapter. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.140  Refunds.



   A.   No refunds will be made on any amount paid as a license fee
except in the case of error on the part of the city in the determination of
the amount of the license tax or in the event of double payment for a license.



   B.   Refunds may be made by the Finance Director, pursuant to the
provisions of subsection A of this section; provided that (1) a written claim
for the refund, made upon a form provided therefor by the Finance Director
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim
for refund is founded, is filed with the Finance Director within one year of
the date the city received the payment of which refund is sought; and (2) the
Finance Director is satisfied, on the basis of written business records and
other records submitted by the claimant, that the claimant is entitled to the
refund under the provisions of subsection A of this section; provided,
however, that the Finance Director (or his authorized agent) shall have the
right to examine and audit all the books and business records of the claimant
in order to determine the eligibility of the claimant to the refund claimed
by him; and provided, further, that no claim for refund shall be allowed if
the claimant therefor refuses to allow such examination of his books and
business cards after request by said Finance Director to do so.



   C.   Any decision of the Finance Director made under this section
shall be final unless the same is appealed to the city council within ten
days after notice thereof. The decision of the city council shall be final
and conclusive on any matter appealed to it under this section. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.150  License payment--statement required.



   A.   In all cases where the amount of license to be paid by any
person is based upon the amount of receipts of sales or of business
transacted, the number of persons employed, the average number of vehicles
used, the amount of the maximum admission fee charge, the number of companies
represented, the number of tables used for any game, or the number of rooms
in any building, such person shall, before obtaining a license for his
business and annually thereafter, file with the Finance Director for his
guidance in ascertaining the amount of license to be paid by such a person, a
written statement showing such information as may be required as of the date
of such statement. No such statement shall be conclusive upon the city and
upon any officer thereof as to the matters there-in set forth, and the same
shall not prejudice the rights of the city to recover any amount that may be
ascertained to be due from such person in addition to the amount shown by
such statement to be due in case such statement should be found to be
incorrect. If any person required to make any such statement fails to do so,
such person shall be required to pay a license at the maximum rate prescribed
in this chapter for the business carried on by such person, and shall be
guilty of a violation of this chapter and be punishable therefor as provided
in this chapter; provided, however, that in any case where the first license
is to be issued for a newly established business, no statement need be made
of the amount of receipts or sales or business transacted, or of the average
number of persons employed and the minimum rate prescribed in this chapter
shall be charged for any newly established business, the amount of license
for which is regulated by the amount of receipts or sales or business
transacted, or by the average number of persons employed during the first
period in which such business is in operation; and provided, further, that
the first license for a newly established business for which a minimum
license is not fixed by this chapter, shall not be required to be paid until
the termination of the license period during which the operation of such
business is commenced. At such termination, the license for such license
period shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided by this section
for the ascertaining and paying of licenses for other license periods.



   B.   In the event of any change in such business prior to the
expiration of one year, a supplemental sworn statement shall be filed at the
time of the renewal of such license next succeeding such change. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.160  License--display.



   Every person having a license under the provisions of this chapter, and
carrying on a business shall keep license posted and exhibited while in
force, in some conspicuous part of the place of business. Every person having
such a license and not having a fixed place of business, shall carry such
license with him at all times while carrying on the business for which the
same was granted. Every person having a license under the provisions of this
chapter shall produce and exhibit the same, when applying for a renewal
thereof, and whenever requested to do so by any police officer, or by any
officer authorized to issue, inspect, or collect licenses. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.170  Branch establishments.



   Separate licenses must be obtained for each branch establishment or
location of the business engaged in, as if each such branch establishment or
location were a separate business, and each license shall authorize the
licensee to engage only in the business licensed thereby at the location or
in the manner designated in such license; provided, that warehouses and
distributing plants used in connection with and incidental to a business
licensed under the provisions of this title shall not be deemed to be
separate places of business or branch establishments. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.180  Carrying on two or more businesses at one location.



   If a person engages in two or more separate businesses at the same
location, there shall be but one license issued to him, based on the
following means of computation of total license fee:



   A flat rate charge for each individual business as required in this
title but in determining the total average number of employees, the total
employees for all businesses shall be combined. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.190  Duplicate licenses.



   Duplicate licenses may be issued by the Finance Director to replace and
license previously issued, which has been lost or destroyed, upon the
licensee filing an affidavit attesting to such fact, and at the time of
filing such affidavit, paying to the Finance Director a fee of two dollars. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.200  Licenses not transferable.



   A.   Licenses issued pursuant to this chapter are not transferable
or assignable by the licensee to any other person, nor shall any fee paid by
any person under the provisions of this title be applied in whole or in part
to the payment of any fee due or to become due from any other person.



   B.   When a licensee transfers its principal place of business to a
new location, the licensee must immediately notify the Finance Director of
its new location and present its license for amendment to show the new
address. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.210  License--inspectors.



   A.   All police officers are appointed inspectors of licenses, and
in addition to their several duties as police officers, may examine all
places of business and persons liable for payment of a license fee, and to
see that such licenses are taken out, and shall have and exercise the power:



      1.   To make arrest for the violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter;



      2.   To enter free of charge, at any time, any place of
business for which a license is required by this chapter and to demand the
exhibition of such license for the current term by any person engaged or
employed in the transaction of such business, and if such person shall then
and there fail to exhibit such license, such person shall be liable to the
penalty provided for a violation of this chapter.



   B.   A complaint may be filed against all persons violating any of
the provisions of this chapter. 



(Ord. 565, 1990).



5.04.300  License fee basis--number of employees plus flat fee.



   A.   Every person engaged in business in the city, whether or not a
fixed place of business in such city, in the business of conducting,
managing, carrying on or engaging in any business, profession or occupation
or service enterprise, including the businesses listed below, shall pay to
the city an annual license fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) per annum plus five

for goods, wares or merchandise, or article for future delivery, or for
services to be performed in the future, or for the making, manufacturing or
repairing any article or thing whatsoever, for future delivery; provided,
however, that this section shall apply only to solicitors who demand, accept
or receive payment or deposit of money in advance of final delivery,
providing further that this shall not apply to any person or firm maintaining
a regular place of business in the city.



      2.   Every person engaged in business as a solicitor shall pay
a license fee of five dollars ($5.00) per month in advance; provided, that

for such license to the Finance Director upon forms provided for such
purpose, containing the name and address of the person, firm or corporation
which he represents, and the kind of goods offered for sale or the kind of
services to be rendered. Such application shall be accompanied by a bond in
the penal sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) executed by a surety company
or by two responsible freeholders residing in the city or, in lieu thereof, a

work or selling coupons for special discount offers, whether work or any part
thereof is to be done outside of the city shall pay a license fee of five
dollars ($5.00) per month; provided, that such solicitor, at the time of
making application for such license, shall file a bond in the manner and form
required by subsections B and C of this section.

of any business license fee under the provisions of this title.



   D.   Nonprofit organizations. The following organizations or
associations shall be exempt from the payment of any business license fee
imposed by the provisions of this title upon any of the following businesses,

educational, military, state, county or municipal organization or association
for the conducting of any business which business is open to the members
thereof only and not open to the public;



      2.   Any religious, fraternal, educational, military, state,
county or municipal organization of association for the conducting or staging
of any amusement or entertainment, concert, exhibition, lecture, dance or

benefits the city as a whole, and which is sponsored by an organization
deriving all or part of its income from the city, or is for the benefit of an
organization or activity supported in whole or part by the city.



   E.   Interstate Commerce. Every peddler, solicitor or other person
claiming to be entitled to exemption from the payment of any business license
provided for in this title upon the grounds that such license casts a burden
upon his right to engage in commerce with foreign nations or among the
several states, or conflicts with the regulations of the United States
Congress respecting interstate commerce, shall file a verified statement with
the Finance Director disclosing the interstate or other character of his
business entitling such exemption. Such statement shall state the name and

question, provided that the sponsoring organization first obtains an
exemption pursuant to § 5.04.410 of this code.  In determining whether or
not to grant an exemption pursuant to this subsection, the Finance Director
shall consider whether the event is primarily intended to promote the Gridley
community and the providing of goods and services is incidental thereto or
whether the event is primarily commercial in nature.  Examples of the types
of events that would qualify for an exemption under this subsection would be
the Red Suspender’s Days and Scare Crow Days as previously sponsored by the
Chamber of Commerce.  There shall be no exemption from the provisions of
this title unless the sponsoring organization obtains an exemption in advance
of the event.  The exemption provided herein shall apply only at the
location of and for the duration of the event in question. The exception
provided by this subsection shall be subject to the conditions as the Finance
Director may impose.

   Any person desiring to claim exemption from the payment of a license
fee shall make application therefor upon forms prescribed by the Finance
Director and shall furnish such information and make such affidavits as may
be required. Upon the determination being made that the applicant is entitled
to exemption from the payment of licenses fees for any reason set forth in
this title, the Finance Director shall issue a free license to such person
which shall show upon its face that the license fee is exempt. This section
shall not apply to persons engaged in any business solely as an employee of
another person and not as an owner, partner, associate or principal in such
business.

record.



   D.   The council may continue the hearing from time to time. At the
hearing, the council shall consider all evidence offered by the appellant and
by the city. The determination of the council shall be final and conclusive,
and notice thereof shall be served upon appellant in the manner prescribed in
this section for service of notice of the hearing.



   E.   The amount of any license fee finally determined, as provided
in this section, shall be due and payable, together with any penalties which

shall attach by reason of any delinquency.



   F.   In the event no appeal is taken to the council from a decision
of the Finance Director or agency with respect to the issuance or refusal to
issue a license, or with respect to the amount of the license fee, the
decision of such Finance Director or agency shall become final and conclusive
on expiration of the time fixed for appeal to the council.

action shall prevent a criminal prosecution for any violation of the
provisions of this title or of any state law requiring the payment of all
license fees.

other grantee franchised or permitted to do business in the city.

be construed as permission or authority to enter on, occupy or otherwise use
private property without the express consent of the owner or agency in
possession thereof. 



(Ord. 505 § 1 (part), 1987).

provision of this chapter, or has, by act or omission, violated any material
term or condition of any franchise or permit issued hereunder; or



      2.   Any provisions of this chapter have become invalid or
unenforceable and the council further finds that such provisions constitute a

unable to negotiate appropriate modifications to the franchise within a
reasonable time following the invalidity or unenforceability of the
provisions; or



      3.   The city acquires the CATV system property of the
grantee. 



(Ord.505 § 1(part), 1987).

   A.   During the six-month period which begins with the thirty- sixth
month before the franchise expiration, the city may, on its own initiative,
and shall at the request of a grantee, commence proceedings which afford the
public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the
purpose of:



      1.   Identifying the future cable-related community needs and
interests; and



      2.   Reviewing the performance of the cable operator under the
franchise during, the then current franchise term presently in effect. The
term of any such renewal shall commence from the effective date of the
renewed franchise. The section does not confer upon the grantee any
substantive or vested rights to renewal of the or vested rights to renewal of
the franchise and the grantor is under no obligation to renew the franchise.



   B.   1. Upon completion of the proceedings described under
subsection A, a grantee seeking renewal of a franchise may, on its own
initiative or at the request of the city, submit a proposal for renewal.



      2.   Any such proposal shall contain such material as the city
may require, to include all matters specified in Section 5.20.260 and to
include proposals for an upgrade of the existing cable system.



      3.   Such proposal for a renewal shall be submitted in writing
to the city within thirty days following the completion of the proceedings
under subsection A.



   C.   1.   Upon submittal by a grantee of a proposal to the city
for the renewal of a franchise, the city shall provide prompt public notice
of such proposal and, during the four-month period which begins on the
completion of any proceedings under subsection A, renew the franchise or
issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed, and
at the request of grantee or on its own initiative, commence an
administrative proceeding to consider whether:



         a.   The grantee has substantially complied with the
material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;



         b.   The quality of the grantee's service, including
signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices (but
without regard to the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other
services provided over the system) has been reasonable in light of community
needs;



         c.   The grantee has the financial, legal, and technical
ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in
the grantee's proposal; and



         d.   The grantee's proposal is reasonable to meet the
future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the
cost of such needs and interests.



      2.   In any proceeding under subsection (C) (1) of this
section, the grantee shall be afforded at least ten days' notice by mail of
any hearing (an initial hearing may thereafter be continued time to time
without any further written notice) and the grantee and the city, or its
designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation,
including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to
issues raised in the proceeding under subsection A), to require the
production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made
of any such proceedings.



      3.   At the completion of a proceeding under this subsection,
the city shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for
renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such
decision to the grantee. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.



   D.   Any denial of a proposal for renewal shall be based on one or
more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in
subsection (C) (1) (a) through (d) of this section, pursuant to the record of
the proceeding under subsection C. The city may not base a denial of renewal
on a failure to substantially comply with the terms of the franchise under
subsection C. The city may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to
substantially comply with the terms of the franchise under subsection (C) (1)
(a) or on events considered under subsection (C) (1) (b) in any case in which
a violation of the franchise or the events considered under subsection (C)
(1) (b) unless the city has provided the grantee with notice and the
opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the
grantee has waived its right to objection, or has effectively acquiesced.



   E.   No franchise granted pursuant to this chapter (or under any
prior law) shall remain in effect beyond the length of its stated term,
provided that any such franchise shall remain in effect at all times during
which the city considers renewal of such franchise pursuant to subsection C
of this section. In the event that the city denies renewal of the franchise,
the franchise shall cease immediately if it has been in effect beyond the
date of its stated term (and hence has remained in effect only while the city
considers renewal), or it shall cease at such time as its stated term expires
(in the event the city's denial of a renewal application occurs prior to the
expiration of the franchise being considered for renewal). As such, the
franchise shall terminate as specified in this subsection, notwithstanding
the fact that an appeal from the decision of the city denying the franchise
remains pending. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit the
city's right to terminate any franchise as provided elsewhere in this chapter.



   F.   The term of any such renewal shall commence from the effective
date of the renewed franchise. This section does not confer upon the grantee
any substantive or vested rights to renewal of the franchise. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.100  Franchise payments.



   Immediately upon execution of the franchise, the grantee shall pay to
the city, on or before March 31st, of each year, a sum of five percent of
gross receipts as defined in Section 5.20.010F, received by the franchisee
for cable television operations in the city for the preceding calendar year.
No other fee, charge or consideration will be imposed except such generally
applicable business license fees, construction, development and inspection,
and permit fees as set by the city. The grantee shall file with the city
within ninety days after the expiration of any calendar year or portion
thereof during which a franchise is in force, a financial statement prepared
by a certified public accountant and in a form satisfactory to the director
of finance for the city, showing in detail the gross annual receipts, as
defined herein, of grantee. Upon reasonable notice and during regular
business hours, the city shall have the right to inspect the grantee's
records, and make copies thereof, covering its gross subscriber revenues
under the franchise and the right of audit and recomputation of any and all
amounts payable under this chapter; the cost of such audit shall be borne by
grantee when the same results in increasing by more than two percent the
grantee's annual payment to the city. No acceptance of any payment shall be
considered as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the
city may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or
for the performance of any other legal obligation hereunder. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.110  Limitations of franchise.



   A.   Any franchise granted under this chapter shall be nonexclusive.



   B.   No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred by any
franchise granted under this chapter except those specifically prescribed in
this chapter.



   C.   Any privilege claimed under such franchise by the grantee in
any right-of-way or city pole or other public property shall be subordinate
to any prior lawful occupancy of the rights-of-way, city pole, or public
property by any other party. The city shall be judge in determining such
claims. The city reserves the right to maintain and to operate its facilities
in such manner as will best enable it to fulfill its own service
requirements. The city shall not be liable to the grantee for any
interruption to the grantee's service or for any interference with the
operation of the grantee's equipment arising in any manner from the use of
any right-of-way, pole, or facility thereon by the city.



   D.   A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall not be
sublet or assigned, nor shall any of the rights or privileges therein granted
or authorized be leased, assigned, sold, or transferred, either in whole or
in part, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right,
interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person, except grantee,
either by act of the grantee or by operation of law, without the prior
written consent of the grantor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
granting of such consent shall not render unnecessary any subsequent consent.



   E.   The grantee shall promptly notify the grantor of any proposed
change in control of the grantee with respect to control shall make the
franchise null and void unless and until the grantor shall have consented
thereto. For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to such
change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall
assist the grantor in any such inquiry. The grantor may condition such
transfer upon the terms and conditions it deems reasonably appropriate.



   F.   For the purpose of this section, a presumptive change in
control will exist upon sale and transfer of thirty percent or more of the
grantee's ownership stock or other control.



   G.   The grantee, at least sixty (60) days prior to any transfer or
change in control as described in this section, shall deliver to Grantor
information concerning the definitive transfer or sales agreement, and
concerning the transferee or proposed controlling entity, as reasonably
appropriate. Upon closing of any such sale or change of control, and if
requested by Grantor, Grantee shall deliver to Grantor a certified copy of
the document or documents evidencing such transfer of change of control.



   H.   Every such transfer as heretofore described, whether voluntary
or involuntary, shall be deemed void and of no effect unless grantee shall
have filed such certified copy as is required and grantor has given approval.



   I.   If the grantee shall violate this section, or fail to obtain
grantor consent, all of the revenues of the system from the date of violation
until the date of consent, if any, shall be returned to system's subscribers,
on a prorated basis, upon written notice to the grantee from the grantor.
Furthermore, any transfer in violation of this section shall be void ab
initio.



   J.   Time shall be of the essence in any franchise granted
hereunder. The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligations to comply
promptly with any of the provisions of this chapter or by failure of the city
to enforce prompt compliance.



   K.   Any right, or power in, or duty impressed upon, any officer,
employee, department or board of the city shall be subject to transfer by the
city to any other officer, employee, department, or board of the city.



   L.   The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city
for any loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of any provision or
requirement of this chapter or its enforcement.



   M.   The grantee shall be subject to all provisions, rules,
regulations, and conditions prescribed by federal, state, city, and local law
theretofore or hereafter enacted or established during the term of any
franchise granted under this chapter; provided, that with respect to city and
local law, that such laws do not materially increase the burdens and
obligations assumed by the grantee nor materially diminish the rights of the
grantee pursuant to such grantee's franchise agreement.



   N.   Any such franchise granted shall relieve the grantee of any
obligation involved in obtaining pole space from the city and shall be in
lieu of any obligation to obtain an encroachment permit for installation of
any of the grantee's property on the rights-of-way. However, it shall not
relieve the grantee from the obligation imposed in any encroachment permit. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.120  Rights reserved to the city.



   A.   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to
contract away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity,
the city's right of eminent domain.



   B.   There is reserved to the city every right and power which is
required to be herein reserved or provided by any ordinance of the city; and
the grantee, by its acceptance of any franchise, agrees to be bound thereby
and to comply with any action or requirements of the city in its exercise of
such rights or power, heretofore or hereafter enacted or established.



   C.   Neither the granting of any franchise hereunder nor any of the
provisions contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the city
from granting any identical or similar franchise to any other person, firm or
corporation, within all or any portion of the city. In the event the city
grants such additional franchises to construct, operate or maintain a CATV
system within the city under more favorable terms and conditions than those
granted to a grantee in a previous franchise agreement, then the agreement
shall be considered modified to include such more favorable terms and
conditions.



   D.   There is reserved to the city the power to amend any section or
part of this chapter so as to require additional or greater standards of
construction, operation, maintenance or otherwise, on the part of the
grantee. Provided, however, that any franchise in existence on the effective
date of this chapter shall be subject to and governed by the law in existence
prior to the effective date of this chapter except insofar as the
requirements set forth in this chapter do not materially increase the burdens
and obligations assumed by the grantee or materially diminish the rights of
the grantee pursuant to such grantee's existing franchise agreement. Any
renewal of existing franchises after the effective date of this chapter shall
be governed by the law in existence at the time such renewal application is
made, and any franchise so renewed shall be subject to all of the provisions
of this chapter.



   E.   Neither the granting of any franchise nor any provisions of
this chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any
governmental right or power of the city.



   F.   The council may do all things which are necessary and
convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may
determine any question of fact which may arise during the existence of any
franchise granted hereunder. The city is authorized and empowered to adjust,
settle, or compromise any controversy or charge arising from the operations
of any grantee under this chapter, either on behalf of the city or and
subscriber, in the best interest of the public. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.130  Location of the property of grantee.



   A.   Any poles, wires, cable lines, conduits or other properties of
the grantee to be constructed or installed in streets, shall be so
constructed or installed only at such location and in such manner as shall be
approved by the public works director acting in the exercise of his
reasonable discretion.



   B.   The grantee shall not install or erect any facilities of
apparatus in or on other public property, places or rights-of-way, or within
any privately owned area within the city which has not yet become a public
street on any tentative subdivision map approved by the city, except those
installed or erected upon public utility facilities now existing, without
obtaining the prior written approval of the public works director.



   C.   In those areas and portions of the city where the transmission
or distribution facilities of both the public utility providing telephone
service and the utility providing electric service are underground, then the
grantee shall construct, operate and maintain all of its transmission and
distribution facilities underground. Amplifiers in grantee's transmission and
distribution lines may be in appropriate housing upon the surface of the
ground as approved by the public works director. The city shall not be
responsible in any manner for any costs incurred by the grantee in placing
grantee's facilities underground. Undergrounding shall be at the grantee's
cost and expense. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.140  Removal and abandonment of property of grantee.



   A.   In the event that the use of any part of the CATV system is
discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of six months, or in the
event such system or property has been installed in any street or public
place without complying with the requirements of grantee's franchise or this
chapter, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or has expired, the
grantee, upon being given ten days' notice shall promptly at no expense to
the city remove from the streets or public places all such above-ground
property and poles of such system other than any which the city engineer may
permit to be abandoned in place. In the event of such removal, the grantee
shall promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has
been removed to the condition satisfactory to the public works director.
Removal of abandoned property if not performed by grantee, may be done by the
grantor and billed to the grantee at grantor's option.



   B.   Any property of the grantee remaining in place one year after
the termination or expiration of the franchise shall be considered
permanently abandoned.



   C.   Any above-ground property of the grantee to be abandoned in
place shall be abandoned in such a manner as the city engineer shall
prescribe. Subject to the provisions of any utility joint use attachment
agreement, upon permanent abandonment of the property of the grantee in
place, the property shall become that of the city and the grantee shall
submit to the public works director an instrument in writing, to be approved
by the city council, transferring to the city the ownership of such property.



   D.   Any and all street and public ways disturbed or damaged during
the construction, operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of the system,
shall be promptly restored by the grantee, at its sole expense, to their
original condition unless otherwise authorized in writing by grantor. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.150  Continuity of service.



   It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive all available
services insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are
honored. In the event that the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify,
or sell the system, or the grantor revokes or fails to renew the franchise,
the grantee ensures, that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted
services to the maximum extent reasonably possible. System interruptions or
disruptions within grantee's reasonable control, in excess of twentyfour
consecutive hours or for forty-eight total hours during any month shall
entitle subscriber(s) to pro rata rebates upon request for the disrupted
period, unless the disrupted period is the result of termination of the
franchise by the grantor, an exercise of the grantor's right of eminent
domain, or other acquisition of the franchise property by the grantor. In the
event of purchase by the grantor, or a change of grantee, the current grantee
shall cooperate with the grantor to operate the system for a temporary period
to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. In any event, grantor
may, by resolution when it deems a good and sufficient cause exists, take
over operation of a system for the purpose of maintaining continuity of
service until any circumstances, which may in the judgment of the grantor
threaten the continuity of service, are resolved to the grantor's
satisfaction. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.160  Changes required by public improvements.



   A.   The grantee, at its expense, shall protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate in the same street or other public place, or
remove from the street or other public place any property of the grantee when
required by the public works director by reason of traffic conditions, public
safety, street vacation, freeway and street construction, change or
establishment of street grade, installations of sewers, drains, water pipes,
power lines, signal lines, tracks or any other type of structures or
improvements by public agencies or as may be required by public agencies;
provided, however, that the grantee in all cases shall have the privileges
and be subject to the obligations to abandon any property of the grantee in
place, as provided in Section 5.20.140 of this chapter. If the grantee
protests any requirement of the public works director, the matter shall be
referred to the city administrator, whose decision shall be final and binding.



   B.   Nothing in this section shall be deemed a taking of the
property of the grantee and grantee shall not be entitled to any surcharge or
other compensation by reason of anything hereunder. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.170  Failure to perform street work.



   Upon failure of the grantee to commence, pursue or complete any work
required by law or by the provisions of this chapter or by its franchise to
be done in any street or other public place within the time prescribed, and
to the satisfaction of the public works director, the public works director,
at his option, may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall pay to
the city the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the public
works director to the grantee within thirty days after receipt of such
itemized report. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987)



5.20.180  Faithful performance bond.



   A.   The grantee, concurrently with the filing of an acceptance of
award of any franchise granted under this chapter, shall furnish to the city
and file with the city clerk, and at all times thereafter maintain in full
force and effect for the term of such franchise or any renewal thereof, at
grantee's sole cost and expense, a corporate surety bond in a company
approved by the city, and in a form approved by the city in an amount to be
determined by grantor but not to exceed fifty thousand dollars renewable
annually, and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the grantee of all
of the grantee's obligations under this chapter and any franchise agreement,
and upon the further condition that in the event grantee shall fail to comply
with any one or more of the material provisions of this chapter or of any
franchise issued to the grantee under this chapter, there shall be
recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond
any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result thereof, including the
full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or
abandonment of any property of the grantee as prescribed hereby which may be
in default, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees and costs, up to
the full amount of the bond, such condition to be a continuing obligation for
the duration of such franchise and any renewal thereof and thereafter until
the grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with the city that may have
arisen from the acceptance of such franchise or renewal by the grantee or
from its exercise of any privilege therein granted. The bond shall provide
that thirty days' prior written notice of intention not to renew,
cancellation, or material change shall be given to the city.



   B.   At the end of the first three years of the term of this
franchise, the amount of the aforesaid corporation surety bond, which the
franchise holder shall maintain in full force and effect for the remainder of
the term of the franchise, shall be in an amount to be determined by grantor
but not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, but shall correspond in all
other particulars to the bond required during the first three years of the
term as required in this section.



   C.   Neither the provisions of this section, or any bond accepted by
the city pursuant hereto, nor any damages recovered by the city pursuant
hereto, nor any damages recovered by the city thereunder, shall be construed
to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the
grantee under any franchise issued under this chapter or for damages, either
to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.190  Indemnification of city.



   A.   The grantee, concurrently with the filing of an acceptance of
award of any franchise granted under this chapter, shall provide and maintain
in full force and effect for the term of such franchise or any renewal
thereof, at grantee's sole cost and expense, a general comprehensive
liability insurance policy in an amount as from time to time set by the
council and by a company approved by the city and in a form satisfactory to
the city attorney, indemnifying and saving harmless the city, its officers,
and employees from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss expense or
damages of every kind and description, including investigation cost, court
costs, and attorney's fees which may accrue to or be suffered or claimed by a
person or persons arising out of the negligence of the grantee in the
ownership, construction, repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of
the cable television system and by reason of any license, copyright, property
right or patent of any article or system used in the construction or use of
the system and protecting the city and all persons against liability for loss
or damage for personal injury, death and property damage, occasioned by the
operations of grantee under such franchise, and any antitrust claim against
grantor relating to the grant or administration of a franchise granted
pursuant to this chapter, with minimum liability limits of two million
dollars for personal injury or death of any person and five hundred thousand
dollars for damage to property resulting from any one occurrence.



   Furthermore, grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the grantor from
any and all liabilities, fees, costs and damages to persons or property, or
expenses of any type or nature which may accrue to the grantor by reason of
the construction, operation, maintenance, repair and alteration of the
grantee's facilities by the grantee, its employees or agents, excluding any
claims arising out of or relating to the negligence or wilful misconduct of
the grantor, its employees or agents. In case any suit or action is
instituted against the grantor asserting claims for which the grantor has a
right of indemnification from the grantee pursuant to this paragraph, the
grantor shall provide written notice thereof to the grantee and the grantee
shall have the duty to defend grantor, nor  shall it be required to
indemnify and hold harmless the grantor, if a suit or action is brought
against the grantor by the grantee.



   B.   Policies mentioned in subsection A of this section shall name
the city, and its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, as
additional insured and shall contain a provision that a written notice of
cancellation or reduction in coverage of the policy shall be delivered to the
city thirty days in advance of the effective date thereof; if such insurance
is provided by a policy which also covers grantee or any other entity or
person other than those above named, then such policy shall contain the
standard cross-liability endorsement. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).

the city and shall contain a provision that a written notice of cancellation
or reduction in coverage of the policy shall be delivered to the city thirty
days in advance of the effective date thereof.

grantee to identify particular persons and the grantee may specifically
provide a record of aggregate data;

complete plans and records showing the exact location of all CATV system

map or set of maps drawn to scale specified by the city engineer, showing all
CATV system equipment installed and in place in streets and other public
places of the city on base maps provided by the city. The city engineer may,

section, in addition to any further data which may be required by the
grantor, shall be furnished by the grantee to the grantor at the grantee's
own cost and expense. The grantor shall have the right to inspect any

5.20.230  Emergency use of facilities.



   In the case of any emergency or disaster, the grantee shall, upon

   H.   A financial statement prepared by a certified public
accountant, or person otherwise satisfactory to the council, showing
applicant's financial status and his financial ability to complete the
construction and installation of the proposed CATV system;

(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.270  Application--action by council.



   A.   Upon consideration of any such application, the city council
may refuse to grant the requested franchise, or the city council, by
resolution, may grant a franchise for a CATV system to any such applicant as
may appear from the application to be in its opinion best qualified to render
proper and efficient CATV service to the television viewers and subscribers
in the city. The city council's decision in the matter shall be final. If
favorably considered, the application submitted shall constitute and form a
part of the franchise as granted. It is the intention of this chapter that
the franchise shall not be granted upon a cash auction bid, but that the city
council shall consider those factors set forth in California Government Code
Section 53066 in granting the franchise, including but not limited to the
following:



      1.   Quality of service offered;



      2.   Experience and financial responsibility of the applicant;



      3.   Applicant's proposals for providing service to local
schools and city installations;



      4.   Whether applicant has a contract with a public utility
providing for use of facilities such as poles, lines or conduits of such
public utility in the city;



      5.   Such other factors as the city council considers
necessary in protecting the public interest.



   B.   Any franchise granted under this chapter shall include the
following conditions:



      1.   The CATV system herein franchised shall be used and
operated solely and exclusively for the purpose expressly authorized by
ordinance of the city and no other purpose whatsoever.



      2.   Inclusion of the foregoing statement in any such
franchise shall not be deemed to limit the authority of the grantor to
include any other reasonable condition, limitation, or restriction which it
may deem necessary to impose in connection with such franchise pursuant to
the authority conferred by this chapter. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.280  Effectiveness and acceptance.



   A.   No franchise granted under this chapter shall become effective
unless and until the resolution granting the franchise has become effective
and, in addition, unless and until all things required in this chapter are
done and completed, all such things being hereby declared to be conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of any such franchise granted under this
chapter. In addition, no franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall become effective until all such things declared to be
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of any such franchise shall be
accomplished. In the event any of such things are not done and completed in
the time and manner required, the council may declare the franchise null and
void.



   B.   Within thirty days after the effective date of the document
awarding a franchise, or within such extended period of time as the council,
in its discretion may authorize, the grantee shall file with the city clerk
his written acceptance in a form satisfactory to the city attorney, of the
franchise, together with the bonds and insurance policies required by Section
5.20.180, 5.20.190 and 5.20.200.

   A.   Within ninety days after acceptance of this franchise, the
grantee shall file all necessary applications to receive permits and
authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business including,
but not limited to, any utility joint-use attachment agreements, microwave
carrier licenses, and any other permits, licenses, and authorizations to be
granted by duly constituted regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
operation of the cable television system, or associated microwave
transmission facilities. In connection therewith, copies of all petitions,
applications and communications submitted by the grantee to the Federal
Communications Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other
federal, state, or regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction with
respect to any matters affecting grantee's cable television and operations,
shall also be submitted simultaneously to the city clerk.



   B.   Within ninety days after the release of at least ten percent of
all poles within the franchise area by the jurisdictional utilities, grantee
shall commence physical construction and installation of the cable television
system.



   C.   Within two years after the commencement of construction
pursuant to subsection B of this section, unless the city council in its
discretion designates a shorter time in the franchise, grantee shall complete
construction and installation of the entire cable television system and
proceed to render service to all residents of the city who desire cable
television service.



   D.   The grantor may in its sole discretion levy a penalty not to
exceed two hundred and fifty dollars per day for each day the grantee exceeds
the construction and installation time table pursuant to subsections B and C
of this section; provided, however, that no such penalty shall be levied
where such delays are a result of war, flood, fire, drought, labor strike,
inability to obtain material or other cause not within grantee's reasonable
control. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.300  Subscriber protection.



   A.   The grantee shall maintain constant vigilance with regard to
possible abuses of the privacy or constitutional rights of any subscriber,
programmer, or citizen resulting from any device, signal, or service
associated with the system. The grantee shall not utilize any capability of
the system for acquisition of information not a normal part of a
grantor-approved service.



   B.   No equipment owned by the grantee shall be installed by the
grantee without first securing the written permission of the owner of any
premises involved. If such permission is later revoked, the grantee upon
request of the owner shall remove forthwith any of its equipment which is
both visible and moveable.



   C.   Nothing herein shall restrict grantee's right to include
additional advertising with grantee's billings.



   D.   Neither the grantee, nor any other person, agency, or entity,
shall unlawfully tap, or arrange for the tapping, of any cable, line, signal
device, signal or subscriber outlet, or receiver for any purpose whatsoever,
except for the sole purpose of determining any unlawful act in violation of
Section 5.20.330. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.310  Service standards.



   A.   It is the grantor's policy that the public shall have access to
accurate and current information on presently available cable services.
Grantee shall make a reasonable effort to provide such information.



   B.   Grantee shall inform grantor at least thirty days in advance of
making any change in service standards. Upon request, grantee will confer
with grantor's representative before taking any such action, and shall give
due consideration to any recommendations grantor may make, either in response
to grantee's statement of intention, or on grantor's own initiative.



   C.   All cable services shall be available to all subscribers who
are willing to pay the charges at the rates established. No charges may be
made for services except as listed in published schedules which are available
to inspection by anyone at grantee's office, quoted by grantee on the
telephone, or displayed or communicated to all potential subscribers prior to
their signing a written order for service, except that grantee may charge
less than the charges regularly assessed for such services at its discretion.



   D.   When a subscriber voluntarily discontinues service, grantee
shall refund the unused portion of any advance payments in excess of two
dollars after deducting any charges currently due. Unused payment portions
shall be the percentage of time for which subscriber has paid for service and
will not receive it because of his discontinuation of service.



   E.   Prior to any installation or delivery of services, all
subscribers shall sign and deliver to grantee a written order for service.
The order shall describe in detail all charges for installation of services,
the method of payment and schedule of payment, and any grace periods, late
charges, or any other information which will affect the total amount
subscriber is to be charged.



   F.   Grantee shall advise each subscriber as may be set forth in the
franchise that the grantor's representative is the official to whom
complaints of poor service should be made if such complaints of poor service
are not resolved by grantee to the satisfaction of each subscriber.



   G.   Grantee may, at its option, charge subscribers for service and
installation no more than two months in advance. Billing periods shall not
exceed two months. Bills may be due and payable upon mailing and shall not be
delinquent sooner than twenty days after mailing. Grantee may offer
subscribers various prepayment schemes at discounts not to exceed reasonable
interest on the subscriber's money for the period of prepayment.



   H.   Grantee may disconnect a subscriber only for cause, which shall
be limited to:



      1.   Payment delinquency in excess of fifteen days;



      2.   Wilful damage to or misappropriation of grantee's
property;



      3.   Refusal, for more than ten days, to admit grantee to the
subscriber's premises to service grantee's equipment;



      4.   Conviction by a court of monitoring, tapping, or
tampering with grantee's system, signals, or services.



   I.   Grantee shall, upon subscriber's written request and payment of
any grantee required deposit, reconnect service which has been disconnected
for payment delinquency when payment has removed the delinquency. A published
standard charge may be made for reconnections. Grantee shall not be required
to make more than three reconnections for the same subscriber if the
disconnections involved were caused by payment delinquency within the past
twelve months.



   J.   Grantee shall advise each subscriber that they have the right
to require their installation to be done over any route on their property, to
any location within any building thereon, and in any manner they may elect,
which is technically and practically feasible, consistent with grantee's
standard practices. Grantee may, if it so elects, require that any such
request be made in writing.



   K.   Grantee shall propose and secure grantor's approval for the
description of standard or normal drop and shall include a determination of
its cost for materials and labor. This shall be the most direct routing of
drop wire from the tap to the subscriber's building construction found in the
franchise area. A nonstandard drop shall be one which departs in total cost
from a standard drop by more than twenty percent. For each nonstandard drop
installed, the grantee may charge the subscriber for the cost of material and
labor in excess of that for a standard drop. Grantee shall obtain a
subscriber's written authorization in advance for all nonstandard drop
charges. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.320 Miscellaneous provisions.



   A.   When not otherwise prescribed in this chapter, all matters
herein required to be filed with the city shall be filed with the city clerk.



   B.   The grantee shall pay to the city a sum of money sufficient to
reimburse it for all publication expenses incurred by it in connection with
the granting of a franchise pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Such
payment shall be made within thirty days after the city furnishes the grantee
with a written statement of such expenses by delivery of same to the city
clerk.



   C.   In the termination of commercial broadcast television programs,
the grantee shall not delete the commercials of the program sponsor nor shall
it interrupt any programs or parts thereof and substitute commercials or
advertisements for those of such program sponsor. However, this section, if
preempted by federal regulations or by contract with the commercial broadcast
television programmer, shall be ineffective, insofar as it is in conflict
with such federal regulations.



   D.   Grantee shall provide all basic subscriber services of its
system, including multiple connection services, on a time and materials
basis, to all public and nonprofit private schools, city police and fire
stations, city recreation centers, and such other buildings owned or
controlled by the city, which shall from time to time be designated by the
city administrator; provided, however, that such buildings shall be located
within the service area. Grantee shall install, without charge to grantor or
such public or private schools, within two hundred feet of service connection
from the transmission cable, otherwise maintained or required to be
maintained by grantee for the service of paying subscribers of grantee. The
grantor or any such public or private schools shall pay to grantee the costs
of all labor and materials supplied by grantee for the installation of any
service connection in excess of the initial two hundred feet.



   E.   Before grantee shall provide service to any subscriber, grantee
shall obtain a signed contract from the subscriber containing a provision
substantially as follows:



      Subscriber understands that in providing service, grantee is
making use of public rights-of-way within the city, and that the continued
use of these public rights-of-way is in no way guaranteed. Subscriber agrees
it will make no claim nor undertake any action against the city, its
officers, its employees or grantee if a service to be provided by grantee
hereunder is interrupted or discontinued because the continued use of such
rights-of-way is denied to grantee for any reason. The form of grantee's
contract with its subscribers shall be subject to approval of the grantor's
attorney with respect to the inclusion of this provision.



   F.   The grantee shall comply with all applicable city construction
codes and permit procedures.



   G.   All construction practices shall be in accordance with all
applicable sections of Federal and State Occupational Safety and Health Acts
and any amendments thereto as well as all state and local codes where
applicable.



   H.   Antennas and support structures (towers) shall be painted,
lighted, erected and maintained in accordance with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration and all other applicable
state or local codes and regulations.



   I.   All of the grantee's plant and equipment, including but not
limited to the antenna site, headend and distribution system towers, house
connections, structures, poles, wire, coaxial cable, fixtures and
appurtenances, shall be installed, located, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained and operated in
accordance with good engineering practices, performed by experienced
maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger or interfere in
any manner with the rights of any property owner, nor hinder or obstruct
pedestrian or vehicular traffic.



   J.   The grantee shall at all times employ common care and shall use
and maintain commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failure and
accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the public.



   K.   Grounds for Revocation. The grantor reserves the right to
revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges
associated with the franchise due to either of the following circumstances
either of which shall represent a material breach of the franchise:



      1.   If the grantee should default in the performance of any
of its material obligations under this chapter or the franchise agreement;



      2.   If the grantee should fail, after receiving ten days'
written notice from the grantor to provide or maintain in full force and
effect, the liability and indemnification coverages or bonds as required
herein. The grantee shall be deemed to have failed to maintain the required
insurance or bonds if the grantee fails to provide adequate assurance to the
grantor that such insurance or bonds will remain in effect after grantor has
been given notice of intent to cancel coverage by the insurance company or
bonding company.



   L.   Procedures Governing Revocation.



      1.   The city shall give written notice to the grantee of its
intent to revoke the franchise and the grounds therefor. Grantee shall have
thirty days from such notice to object, in writing, and to state the reasons
for such objection.



      2.   In the event the city does not receive a response
satisfactory to it, it may then proceed to place its request for revocation
of the franchise on the agenda for a council meeting. The city shall serve
upon the grantee, at least ten days prior to the time and place of such
meeting, a written notice of its intent to request such revocation, and the
time and place of the meeting.



      3.   At the designated meeting, the grantee shall be afforded
fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce
evidence, to be represented by counsel, and to question witnesses.



      4.   Any decision to revoke the franchise shall be made by a
vote of three or more members of the city council.



      5.   Any revocation shall become effective immediately.



   M.   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall include
the conditions that the CATV system franchise shall be used and operated
solely and exclusively for the purpose expressly authorized by ordinance of
the city and no other purpose whatsoever. Inclusion of this statement in any
franchise shall not be deemed to limit the authority of the city or to
include any other reasonable condition, limitation or restriction which it
may deem necessary to impose in connection with such franchise pursuant to
the authority conferred by this chapter.



   N.   The grantee shall offer to make a lock box available to each of
its subscribers. For purposes of this paragraph, a "lock box" is a parental
control device, either in the form of a separate unit or incorporated into a
descrambler or other piece of equipment used to provide cable television
service, which is made operational by a key or by a code, and which enables
the subscriber to prevent the viewing of any pay channel offering adult
programming.



   O.   Unless the grantee's cable television system incorporates
technology to prevent unwanted reception of audio and video signals from
occurring under normal operating conditions, the system shall provide a
written statement to all new subscribers advising them that audio or video
signals, or both, may be present on certain channels to which they do not
subscribe. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.330  Violation--penalty.



   A.   From and after the effective date of this chapter, it shall be
unlawful for any person to establish, operate or to carry on the business of
distributing to any persons in this city any television signals or radio
signals by means of a CATV system unless a franchise therefor has first been
obtained pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and unless such
franchise is in full force and effect.



   B.   From and after the effective date of this chapter, it shall be
unlawful for any person to construct, install or maintain within any
right-of-way in the city, or within any privately owned area within the city
which has not yet become a public right-of-way but is designated or
delineated as a proposed right-of-way on any tentative subdivision map
approved by the city, any equipment or facilities for distributing any
television signals or radio signals through a CATV system, unless a franchise
authorizing such use of such right-of-way or property or area has first been
obtained pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and unless such
franchise is in full force and effect.



   C.   It is unlawful for any person to make or use any unauthorized
connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively or
otherwise, with any part of the franchised cable television system within
this city for the purpose of taking or receiving or enabling himself/herself
or others to receive or use any television signals, radio signals, picture,
program or sound, without payment to the owner of the system. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, utilization of equipment to receive directly from any
satellite, any signal by an individual for his/her utilization or that of
his/her invitees shall not be subject to nor be in violation of this chapter
so long as such signal is not scrambled and there is no marketing program in
place for the purchase of such signals and he/she does not retransmit such
signal.



   D.   It is unlawful for any person, without the consent of the
owner, to wilfully tamper with, remove or injure any cables, wires, or
equipment used for distribution of television signals, radio signals,
pictures, programs or sound.



   E.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this section
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be
fined in an amount not exceeding five hundred dollars or be imprisoned in the
county jail for a period not exceeding six months or be both so fined and
imprisoned. Each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue
shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such
hereunder. 



(Ord. 505 § 1(part), 1987).



5.20.340  Severability.



   If any material section or provision of this chapter relating to system
design, line extension, service mix or levels, amendment, duration of
franchise, and studio and other production facilities, or franchise awarded
under it, is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, grantor shall thereupon make a determination of the effect upon
the public interest caused thereby. If the grantor shall find, that a
negative and material effect has been produced, then an involuntary
modification contrary to the public interest shall be deemed to have
occurred. Upon such an occurrence, the parties shall endeavor to renegotiate
the terms of the franchise issued hereunder unless, following reasonable
efforts by the parties to renegotiate the franchise terms, the parties are
unable to reach an agreement.

one-half inches), one to be filed with his application and one to be
permanently attached to his driver's permit when issued, which permit shall
be posted in a place conspicuous from the passenger's compartment of the
taxicab while said driver is operating same. Every driver's permit issued
under the provisions of this chapter shall set forth the name of the owner
for which the driver is authorized to operate a taxi- cab, and shall be valid
only so long as he continues in the employ of such owner. Upon the
termination of such employment, the driver shall forthwith surrender his
driver's permit to the city clerk. No such driver's permit shall be granted
to any person under the age of eighteen years. Such driver's permit may be
denied upon the substantial evidence of facts of either physical or moral
deficiencies of the applicant, which in the sound discretion of the city
council would render such applicant not a competent person to operate a
taxicab.



   C.   No driver's permit issued under the provisions of this chapter
shall be transferrable in any event.



   D.   All drivers employed by any given owner while on duty shall

for whom such driver has been working shall immediately give the city clerk

   A.   The city council and the chief of police, and either of them,
shall have the power to revoke or suspend any driver's permit issued under
the provisions of this chapter in the event the holder thereof shall be found
guilty of a violation of any provisions of this chapter or shall be found
guilty of reckless driving, or for the violation of any other provision of
this chapter or other law, which violation, in the sound discretion of the
officials, shall be deemed sufficient evidence of the fact that the driver is
not a competent person to operate a taxicab. Such revocation by the chief of
police, together with the reason therefor, shall be forthwith reported to the
city council.



   B.   In the event of such revocation or suspension of a driver's
permit, such certificate as may be issued in connection therewith shall be,
by the holder thereof, forthwith surrendered to the city clerk.

time; and whenever all passengers have been discharged from any taxicab, it
shall be the duty of the driver thereof to proceed at once by the most direct
route to the regular stand of such taxicab or garage, or other point where
the vehicle is stored. It is unlawful, within the central business district,
to park taxicabs at any point other than a taxicab stand, except when

hearing by notifying the City Clerk thereof in writing within ten days after
the date shown on the notice. Any such hearing shall be set not earlier than

released by the Finance Director unless and until it is fully and completely
paid or an acceptable arrangement with the city has been agreed to by the
city.

administrative cost of the delinquency, including costs associated with
processing the delinquent account, which will be subject to an individual

Administrator to Council, a report of delinquent charges.

consideration of the report, the Council shall hear it along with any
objections of the property owners liable to be assessed for delinquent
accounts. The Council may make such revisions, corrections, or modifications
to the report as it may deem just; and in the event the Council is satisfied
with the correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or
modified), it shall be confirmed or rejected by resolution. The decision of
the City Council on the report and on all protests or objections thereto
shall be final and conclusive.

assessment against the property at which the services were rendered.
Thereafter, such assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the
same penalties and same procedure of sale as provided for delinquent ordinary
property taxes.



         (b)   The assessments shall be subordinate to all
existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the property, and
paramount to all other liens except those for state, county and municipal
taxes with which it shall be upon parity. The lien shall continue until the
assessment and all interest and penalties due and payable thereon are paid.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of property taxes
shall be applicable to the special assessments.



      8.   Report transmitted to auditor: A certified copy of the
confirmed report shall be filed annually with the county auditor on or before
August 15th. The descriptions of the parcels subject to the special
assessment shall be those used for the same parcels on the county assessor's

Before the abatement officer arrives, any property owner may remove the
weeds, rubbish, refuse and dirt at his or her own expense. Nevertheless, in
any case in which any order to abate is issued, the City Council by motion or
resolution may further order that a special assessment and lien be imposed
pursuant to Government Code § 39577. In that case, the assessment and lien
shall be limited to the costs incurred by the City of Gridley in enforcing
the abatement upon the parcels, including investigation, boundary
determination, measurement, clerical and other related costs.



(Ord. 791-2010 (part), 2010; Ord. 583, 1991)

   A.   The cost of abatement in front of or upon each parcel of land
and the costs incurred by the city in enforcing abatement upon the parcels,
upon investigation, boundary determination, measurement, clerical and other
related costs, constitutes a special assessment against that parcel. After
the assessment is made and confirmed, a lien attaches on the parcel upon
recordation of the order confirming the assessment in the office of the
county recorder of the county in which the property is situated, except that
if any real property to which such lien would attach has been transferred or
conveyed to a bonafide encumbrance or for value has been created and attaches
thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of such taxes as
imposed by Government Code § 39578 would become delinquent, then the lien
which would otherwise be imposed by this section shall not attach to such
real property and the costs of abatement and the cost of enforcing abatement,
as confirmed, relating to such property, shall be transferred to the
unsecured roll for collection.



   B.   Except as specified in subparagraph A of this section, after
confirmation of the report, a copy shall be given to the tax collector, who
shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular tax bill levied
against the parcel for municipal purposes. A certified copy of the report
shall be filed with the county auditor before August 10th. The descriptions
of the parcels reported shall be those used for the same parcels on the
county assessor's map books for the current year.



   C.   The amount of the assessment shall be collected at the time and
in the manner of ordinary municipal taxes. If delinquent, the amount is
subject to the same penalties and procedure of foreclosure and sale provided
for ordinary municipal taxes.

8.08.070  Refund of assessments erroneously levied.



   The City Council may order refunded all or part of an assessment paid
pursuant to this article if it finds that all or part of the assessments have
been erroneously levied. An assessment or part shall not be refunded unless a
claim is filed with the clerk of the city on or before November 1st after the
assessment became due and payable. The claim shall be verified by the person
who paid the assessment or by the person's guardian, conservator, executor or
administrator.

8.08.080  Specified procedures are cumulative.



   The procedures specified in this chapter are cumulative and
supplemental insofar as the city reserves unto it all rights and remedies
which it may have with respect to the abatement of weeds, rubbish and other
public nuisances. In that regard, this chapter shall be deemed to be
supplemental and not limit any other rights or remedies which the city might
have under any other provision of law. The abatement of weeds, rubbish and
other public nuisances may also be abated pursuant to Chapter 8.06.  Fines
may be assessed as defined in Chapter 1.09.

provisions of the most restrictive shall govern. Repairs, additions or
alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy, shall be done in

permit any weeds, brush, or dry vegetation, or to place, cause or permit any
garbage or material likely to become easily ignited, to be or remain on such
real property in the City or on portions of the streets that adjoin such
property.



   B.   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled
or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not
including highways creates a condition tending to reduce the value of private
property promoting blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create
fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance to create a refuge for
rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general
welfare.



   C.   Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or
inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not
including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to
constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.

   This Chapter is not the exclusive regulation of property maintenance
within the City. It shall supplement and be in addition to the regulatory
statutes and ordinances that have been or will be enacted by the City, State,
or any other legal entity or agency having jurisdiction. The enforcement
officer, has the authority, in the alternative or in conjunction with the
enforcement remedies set forth in this Chapter, to issue citations pursuant
to Chapter 1.12 and any violation of this Chapter may be punished as an

including the right to abate violations of this Chapter as a nuisance in any
fashion allowed under law.

   A.   Any violation of this Chapter may be prosecuted by the
enforcement officer. The City Administrator is hereby designated the
enforcement officer. In addition to the authority which may be specifically
provided in this Chapter, the enforcement officer may exercise such powers as
may be necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and
provisions of this Chapter. The enforcement officer may appoint and fix the
duties of such officers, agents, and employees as deemed necessary to carry
out the purposes of this Chapter and may delegate any functions or powers to
such officer, agents, and employees.



   B.   For purposes of enforcing the provisions of this Chapter, in
the absence of express permission by the property owner or legal occupant to
enter into the interior spaces of structures or into or onto areas behind
fences, walls and barriers to view, the enforcement officer or his designee

8.10.100  Authority for abatement and removal.



   The enforcement officer shall have authority to cause the abatement and
removal or correction of any condition of property in violation of this
Chapter. The cost of abatement shall become a special assessment against the
property in question, which may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected and shall be subject to the
same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency, as
provided for ordinary municipal taxes. The procedure for abatement and
special assessment of the costs thereof shall be in accordance with Section
8.10.080. The abatement procedure specified in Section 8.10.080 may be used
as an alternative to, or in addition to any other regulatory authority of the
City, including but not limited to, the prosecution of a violation of this
Chapter as an infraction.



(Ord. 819-2016 § 2 (part), 2016)



8.10.110  Procedure for abatement.



   A.   A responsible party charged with a violation under this Chapter
and prosecuted under this Section shall be mailed a 10-day preliminary notice
of intention to abate any violation of this Chapter as a public nuisance. The
notice shall be mailed by registered or certified mail to the responsible
party of land on which the violation is found. The notice of intention shall
be substantially in the following form:



      NOTICE OF INTENTION TO ABATE A PUBLIC NUISANCE



   (Name and Address of Responsible party of the Land)



   As responsible party shown on the last equalized assessment roll of the
land located at (address), you are hereby notified that the undersigned,
pursuant to (applicable section of Chapter 8.10) has determined that there
exists upon said land a public nuisance, pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 8.20 of the Gridley Municipal Code, in that (Describe violation).



   You are hereby notified to abate said nuisance within ten (10) days
from the date of mailing of this notice and upon your failure to do so, the
same will be abated and/or removed by the City and the costs thereof,
together with administrative costs, assessed to you as the responsible party
of land.



   You may submit a sworn statement within such ten (10) day period to
City Hall denying responsibility for said nuisance on said land, with your
reasons for denial and such statement shall be construed as a request for
hearing at which your presence is not required.



   You may appear in person at any hearing requested by you or, in lieu
thereof, may present a sworn written statement in time for consideration at
such hearing.



   (date notice mailed)



   (Signature line for Enforcement Officer)



   B.   If no hearing is requested, an order for abatement may be
issued and the costs thereof, assessed against the property, as provided
herein. If a request for a hearing is received by the enforcement officer
within 10 days of mailing, as provided in subsection A. above, an
administrative hearing shall be held by the City Administrator or his/her
designee on the question of abatement and removal of the public nuisance and
the assessment of the administrative costs and the costs of removal of the
nuisance against the property on which it is located. The City Administrator
shall provide written notice of the time and place of the administrative
hearing and shall give at least 10 days' notice if the same is served by mail
and at least five (5) days' notice if the same is responsible party delivered.



   C.   The hearing specified in subsection B. above shall be held
before the City Administrator or his/her designee who shall hear all facts
and testimony on the circumstances concerning the public nuisance on the
property in question. Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to this
hearing. The responsible party charged with a violation may appear in
responsible party or may present a sworn written statement prior to the time
of the hearing and deny responsibility for public nuisance, stating his
reasons for such denial.



   D.   The City Administrator shall impose such conditions and take
such actions as deemed appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
purposes of this Chapter. He/she may delay the time for abatement of the
public nuisance if, in his/her opinion, the circumstance warrants. At the
conclusion of administrative hearing, the City Administrator may find that a
public nuisance exists on the property and order the same abated from the
property as a public nuisance and disposed of and determine the
administrative costs and the costs for removal to be charged against the
responsible party of the land and make a special assessment against the
property. The order requiring removal shall include the description of the
public nuisance.



   E.   Any party to a proceeding under this Section may appeal the
decision of the City Administrator by filing a written notice of appeal with
the City Clerk within five days of the rendering of the decision by the City
Administrator. The appeal shall be heard by the City Council which may
affirm, amend, or reverse the order and take other action deemed appropriate.
The City Clerk shall give written notice of the time and place of the hearing
to the appellant. In conducting the hearing, the City Council shall not be
limited by the technical rules of evidence.

8.10.120  Assessment of costs against property.



   If the administrative costs and charges of abatement of the public
nuisance that are charged against the responsible party of property, pursuant
to this Chapter, are not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of the
order or a final disposition of an appeal therefrom, such costs shall become
a special assessment against the parcel of property in question, pursuant to
Government Code Sections 38773 and 38773.5. The assessment may be collected
at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are
collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure
and sale in case of delinquency, as provided for ordinary municipal taxes.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of municipal
taxes shall be applicable to this assessment; however, if any real property,
to which the cost of abatement relates, has been transferred or conveyed to a
bona fide purchaser for value or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for
value has been created and attaches thereon prior to the date on which the
first installment of the taxes would become delinquent; then, the cost of
abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property, but instead
shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. Notices or
instruments, relating to the abatement proceeding or special assessment,
shall be entitled to recordation.

8.24.010  Purpose and findings.



   The City Council of the City of Gridley finds that:



   A.   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major
contributor to indoor air pollution; and



   B.   Reliable studies have shown that breathing sidestream or
secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard for certain population
groups, including elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease,
and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and
those with obstructive airway disease; and



   C.   Health hazards induced by breathing sidestream or secondhand
smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise
tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction, and
bronchospasm; and



   D.   Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who
suffer other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke may
experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick
leave because of adverse reactions to same; and



   E.   The smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plants, is a
proven danger to health. Accordingly, it has been determined that the health,
safety and general welfare of the residents of, persons employed in, and
persons who frequent this city would be benefitted by the regulation of
smoking in enclosed places, including places of employment.

   8.28.030   Enforcement.



8.28.010  Purpose and findings.



   The city council hereby finds and declares as follows:



   A.   Whereas, smoking is the greatest preventable cause of death in
our nation, killing more than 390,000 Americans each year; and



   B.   Whereas, California State Penal Code Sections 308(a) and 308(b)
prohibit the purchase and possession of tobacco products and paraphernalia by
minors; and



   C.   Whereas, over 29 million packs of cigarettes are illegally sold
to California minors annually; and



   D.   Whereas, nearly ninety percent of all tobacco users start well
before the age of 18; and



   E.   Whereas, shoplifting of cigarettes from tobacco self-displays
is one means by which minors access tobacco products; and



   F.   Therefore, the city council finds it in the public interest to
promote the welfare of Gridley residents under the 18 years of age by further
restricting youth access to tobacco products with the prohibition of tobacco
self-displays in our community. 



(Ord. 730, 2004).



8.28.020  Self-service tobacco displays prohibited.



   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person, business or tobacco
retailer within the incorporated City of Gridley to sell, permit to be sold,
offer for sale or display for sale any tobacco product by means of
self-service display, rack or shelf that allows self-service sales or smaller
counter top displays for any tobacco product that allow other than
vendor-assisted sales.



   B.   All tobacco products shall be offered for sale exclusively by
means of vendor/employee assistance, with tobacco products in a case
requiring employee assistance to retrieve the tobacco products. 



(Ord. 730, 2004).



8.28.030  Enforcement.



   Violations of Section 8.28.020 is a misdemeanor and shall be subject to
a fine not exceeding $1,000 per day for each violation, with each day that

Attorney’s office, the City Attorney’s office and/or the Police
Department may enforce this chapter.

   It is unlawful for any person to leave or permit to remain on any
public highway, alley, sidewalk, crosswalk or other public way open for
pedestrian travel, any merchandise, baggage, or any article of personal
property; provided, that this does not apply to any temporary rack or stand
used for the purpose of displaying newspapers for sale, while such rack or
stand is so used, if such rack or stand does not occupy any portion of the
highway set aside for vehicular use and such rack or stand does not cover an

   Political pamphlets, newspapers, and other items that can be construed
as coming under the purview of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States shall likewise not be deposited, left, or thrown upon any
public highway, street, or sidewalk in the city. This does not prohibit the
handing out of the pamphlet, newspaper or other item to persons who wish to

intended to prohibit the littering of public areas within the city. In this
regard, any person who does so litter the public highway, streets, or
sidewalks within the city with printed material which comes within the
purview of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States shall
be given warning, either in writing or orally, the first time that the
littering is noted. Upon the second occasion when the Constitutionally

any private property in the city when the property is signed with a readable
sign, with letters no less than one inch high, legible from the sidewalk,
which prohibits unsolicited documents of any kind from being deposited upon
the private property. The deposit of literature, pamphlets, or other trash in
violation of this section shall be deemed a misdemeanor and punishable as
such.



   B.   The deposit of articles of personal property or trash, which
does not come within the purview of the First Amendment of the Constitution
of the United States, upon private property without the consent of the owner
is deemed a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as such. This offense is not
predicated upon a sign or prior warning. 



(Ord. 301 §§ 4, 6, 1977).



9.08.050  Unsolicited publications.



   In addition to Section 9.08.050 or in lieu thereof, any individual who
does not want unsolicited literature, newspapers, pamphlets, or other
publications deposited upon his premises shall write a letter to the
publisher of such document or documents requesting that no more such
literature or documents be left upon the premises, and the individual writing
such letter or letters shall deposit with the city clerk copies thereof.
Subsequently, if there is a repetition of the deposit of such items upon the
private property, the person or persons so depositing the same shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and the offense shall be punishable as such. The city
clerk shall maintain in his office a file of the letters for use as evidence
in subsequent prosecutions of offenders. 



(Ord. 301 § 5, 1977).



9.08.060  Exceptions.

   It is unlawful for any person to loiter in, on or near any thoroughfare
or place open to the public or place open to public view in a manner and
under circumstances manifesting a purpose of engaging in unlawful drug
activity. 



(Ord. 729, 2004)



9.14.010  Definitions.

11400 of the code, and such amendments thereto as may hereafter be adopted.



   B.   “Known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller,” means a
person who has, within the knowledge of the arresting officer, been convicted
in any court within the State of California of any unlawful drug activity, or
convicted of any substantially similar activity under the laws of any other

(Ord. 729, 2004).



9.14.020  Findings.



   The City Council finds and determines that:



   A.   Violent crime in this community is and continues to escalate at
an alarming rate.  The citizens of this community are violently victimized
and intimidated by individuals who have embraced a criminal life style which
has no place in a civilized society.



   B.   The presence of illegal activity, and in particular, unlawful
drug activity, fosters an environment that attracts crime, degrades the
quality of life in neighborhoods by creating visual blight, health hazards to
our youth and others in the presence of used hypodermic syringes, discarded
dangerous drugs, and other trash and rubbish, and impacts the business
community by turning away potential customers from the places of business
within the area where drug dealers, drug users and purchasers congregate to
sell, consume and purchase drugs.



   C.   It is a legitimate need of the City of Gridley to address
problems inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the community and
loitering with the intent to commit certain illegal acts is such a problem.



   D.   The Council desires to enhance the ability of law enforcement
to curtail the environment which is conducive to criminal activity from the
streets of this community with an additional enforcement tool to abate the
public nuisance created by the individuals who engage in the illegal
activities described in this section. 



(Ord. 729, 2004).



9.14.030  Circumstances.

person has violated this chapter based upon the knowledge and personal
observations of the arresting officer, are the following:

   B.   The person is in the company of, or inside or near a vehicle
registered to, a known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller, or a person
for whom there is an outstanding warrant for unlawful drug activity.



   C.   The person is currently subject to an order prohibiting his or
her presence in a drug area, or prohibiting the person from being in the
company of a known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller.



   D.   The person behaves in a manner as to raise reasonable suspicion
that he or she is seeking to engage in, or is about to engage in, or is then
engaged in any unlawful drug activity, including, by way of example only,
acting as a "lookout," making gestures or statements to motorists or
pedestrians known to represent invitations to purchase or sell drugs, or
exchanging small objects or packages with another person in a furtive manner.



   E.   The person is identified as a member of a criminal street gang,
as defined in Section 186.22(f) of the Penal Code, or a group which has,
among its members, known unlawful drug users, possessors, or sellers.  The
method of identification may include, but is not limited to, the wearing of
distinctive clothing or insignias.



   F.   The person attempts to conceal himself or herself from the
observation of the arresting officer or conceals or disposes of any object
which reasonably could be involved in the conduct of any unlawful drug
activity.

Chapter 9.24 DRUG PARAPHERNALIA



   9.24.010   Purpose.



   9.24.020   Definitions.



   9.24.030   Display prohibited.



   9.24.040   Distribution prohibited.



9.24.010  Purpose.



   A.   The illegal use of controlled substances within the
incorporated area of the city creates serious social, medical and law
enforcement problems. The illegal use of such substances by persons under
eighteen years of age has reached crisis dimensions. It is causing serious
physical and psychological damage to the youth of this community, an
impairment of educational achievement and of the efficiency of the
educational system, increases in nondrug related crime, and a threat to the
ability of the community to ensure future generations of responsible and
productive adults --all to the detriment of the health, safety, and welfare
of the citizens of the city.



   B.   A ban only upon the display and distribution of drug
paraphernalia to persons under eighteen years of age would not be practical.
The person who displays or distributes would have difficulty determining who
could lawfully view or receive drug paraphernalia. The already thinly staffed
law enforcement agencies would be subjected to added enforcement burdens by
adding age of a person who view or received paraphernalia as an element of a
prohibition upon display and distribution. A significant number of high
school students are eighteen years of age or older. It would be lawful to
distribute paraphernalia to some student attending the same school in which
the distribution to other students would be prohibited. Permitted display and
distribution to adults within the community would symbolize a public
tolerance of illegal drug use, making it difficult to explain the rationale
of programs directed against similar abuse by youth. The problem of illegal
consumption of controlled substances by adults within this community is
significant and substantial, necessitating a cessation of the encouragement
to drug abuse which the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia create.



   C.   This chapter is a measure which is necessary in order to
discourage the illegal use of controlled substances within the incorporated
area of the city. 



(Ord. 378 § 1, 1981).

following meanings:



   A.   "Business" means fixed location, whether indoors or outdoors,
at which merchandise is offered for sale at retail.



   B.   "Controlled substance" means those controlled substances set
forth in Section 11054, 11055, 11056, 11057 and 11058 of the California
Health and Safety Code, identified as Schedules I through V, inclusive, as
said sections now exist or may hereafter be amended.



   C.   "Display" means to show to a patron or place in a manner as so
to be available for viewing or inspection by a patron.



   D.   "Distribute" means to transfer ownership or a possessory
interest to another, whether for consideration or as a gratuity. "Distribute"
includes both sales and gifts.



   E.   "Drug paraphernalia" means all equipment, products, and
materials of any kind which are intended by a person charged with a violation
of this chapter for illegal use in planting, propagating, cultivating,
growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing,
processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repacking, storing,
containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise
introducing into the human body a controlled substance in violation of any
law of the state. "Drug paraphernalia" includes, but is not limited to, all
of the following:

   In accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by
the state under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned,
wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public
nuisances, the city council hereby makes the following findings and
declarations:



   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, or dismantled
vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, including highways,
is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private
property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to
create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard
to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and
insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare.
Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative
vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property, except as expressly
permitted in this chapter is declared to constitute a public nuisance, which
may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 



(Ord. 716-2002 § I(part); Ord. 530 (part), 1988).



10.80.020  Purpose.



   A.   The provisions of this chapter are intended to provide a
procedure for the abatement of nuisances consisting of abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, and are enacted under
the authority granted by the State, under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code.



   B.   It is the intent of the City Council to provide that the
abatement of public nuisances consisting of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or

constituting a public nuisance on any premises within the county, as deemed
appropriate under the circumstances.

consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the
vehicle on the land, with his or her reasons for such denial.



   B.   The hearing board may impose such conditions and take such
other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
purpose of this chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle, or
part thereof, if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the
conclusion of the public hearing, the hearing board may find that a vehicle,

on the land without consent of the land owner, and that he or she has not
subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the hearing board shall not assess
costs of administration or removal against the property upon which the
vehicle is located, or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such land
owner.



   D.   If an interested party makes a written presentation to the
hearing board but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing of
the decision.

amend or reverse the order or take other action deemed appropriate.



   C.   The City Clerk shall give written notice of the time and place
of the hearing to the appellant and those persons specified in 10.80.150.

   B.   If curbs and gutters and/or sidewalks, or any of them, are in
place but in need of repair, the city shall require the necessary repairs to
be made, including the complete replacement of substandard facilities with
new facilities if necessary, before issuing any permit, as set forth in this
chapter, and the repairs shall be included in the plans submitted by the real
estate owner, contractor, or developer.



   C.   If no curb and gutter exists within the block where new curb
and gutter improvements are required, the city engineer may require that the
property owner execute a deferred improvement agreement for the future
construction of said improvements, subject to the approval of the city
council. The property owner shall agree to pay all costs of such
installation, except as provided in section 12.05.015 of this title. 



(Ord. 645 1995; Ord. 521 § 1(part), 1987).



12.04.021  Precautionary warnings; other conditions; engineer's preliminary
estimate of costs included in Deferred Improvement Agreements.



   A.   Any deferred improvement required by the City Engineer pursuant
to Section 12.04.020 shall contain the following precautionary warnings to
the owner in substantially the following form




"PRECAUTIONARY WARNINGS TO OWNER




The Owner is cautioned and advised that by entering into this Agreement, the
Owner's legal rights and property rights will be affected. As examples, and
not by way of limitation, Owner is apprised of the following with respect to
this Agreement:



      1.   The Agreement will create a lien against owner's
property. A lien is a charge or security upon property for payment of some
debt, obligation, or duty. In this particular case, this Agreement will be
recorded in the Butte County Recorder's office and the lien will be of public
record. In the event Owner fails to abide by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the City would have the right to foreclose the lien (i.e., the
City would have the right to sell Owner's property in satisfaction of the
obligation). In addition, the recording of the lien could prevent or make
difficult the ability to obtain a loan from a lender secured by Owner' s
property.



      2.   This Agreement gives the City the right at anytime to
call due Owner's performance under this Agreement upon the giving of ninety
(90) days notice. It is very difficult for the City to predict the time when
it might require Owner's performance under the Agreement, and owner should
not assume that any particular length of time will pass before the City gives
ninety (90) days notice to perform.



      3.   Owner acknowledges that the obligations created by this
Agreement will "run with the land," which means that these obligations are
imposed both upon Owner and any successor to the Owner and in that regard,
the recordation of this Agreement might cause the fair market value of
owner's property to decrease.



      4.   Owner is further advised that "Exhibit B" to this
Agreement sets forth the street frontage improvements to be constructed,
however, it is difficult to determine the scope of the improvement work until
the project is designed and adequate survey data is available. It is also
possible that the field conditions may change between the time this Agreement
is executed and the time the improvements are constructed. The cost of the
improvements may involve items not easily estimated, such as utility
relocation costs, undergrounding of culverts, street widening and the like.
The construction costs will vary depending upon the method of contracting for
the work (private construction is normally less expensive than a public works
project).



      5.   Finally, Owner is encouraged to contact a qualified real
estate agent, attorney, or other person of appropriate qualifications and
expertise to advise them regarding the potential impact of this Agreement on
the value and/or marketability of their property or to, in any other respect,
counsel them regarding the consequences of signing this Agreement.



      6.   In the event the Owner has requested an engineers
estimate pursuant to Gridley Municipal Code Section 12.04.021C, it is
expressly understood and agreed that the City Engineer's estimates shall not
be binding upon the City for purposes of any subsequent construction (or the
Owner's costs thereunder) and said estimate shall be given as an
accommodation to the Owner and to aid the Owner's decision whether or not to
enter into this Deferred Improvement Agreement as opposed to installing
frontage improvements concomitantly with the development of the land, the
subject of this Agreement. In addition, the failure of this Deferred
Improvement Agreement to contain the language specified in Gridley Municipal
Code Section 12.04.021 shall not invalidate the Agreement if it would
otherwise be enforceable without such provisions."



   B.   In addition to the foregoing warnings, any Deferred Improvement
Agreement between the City and the Owner shall advise the Owner that the
requirement to install "frontage improvements" does not necessarily mean that
the improvements shall be located at the "front" of the dwelling or other
structure being constructed by the Owner. In addition, any Deferred
Improvement Agreement shall contain a provisions that the Owner's obligations
to construct frontage improvements shall occur not less than 90 days after
notification by the city of Gridley that the Owner must proceed to construct
frontage improvements as specified in the Deferred Improvement Agreement.



   C.   Upon receipt of a written request from the Owner prior to the
execution of any Deferred Improvement Agreement under Section 12.04.020, the
City Engineer shall prepare an estimate as to the specific frontage
improvements and the estimated cost of construction which would be required
if the Owner were to install the frontage improvements at the present time.
The City Engineer's estimates shall not be binding upon the City for purposes
of any subsequent construction (or the Owner's costs thereunder) but shall be
given as an accommodation to the Owner and to aid the Owner's decision
whether or not to enter into a Deferred Improvement Agreement as opposed to
installing the frontage improvements at the time of the new construction for
development of the land in question. The failure of a Deferred Improvement
Agreement to contain the terms specified in this section shall not invalidate
the Agreement if it would otherwise be enforceable without such provisions.



12.04.030  Installation required for occupancy.



   The construction of curbs and gutters and/or sidewalks shall be deemed
to be an integral part of the overall construction when such construction is
required as a condition of the permit, as set forth in this chapter, and the
premises shall not be passed upon for occupancy by the building inspector
until the required curbs and gutters and/or sidewalks are properly and
completely installed. 



(Ord. 521 § 1 (part), 1987).



12.04.040  Installation by city--costs.



   A.   If the property owner does not provide for the required curbs
and gutters and/or sidewalks, as set forth in this chapter, the city can
install the required curbs and gutters and/or sidewalks at its sole expense,
after which the city may charge the land owner; and place a lien against the
land for all costs incurred except those in which the city may participate
pursuant to chapter 12.05.015 of this title.



   B.   In this regard, the city shall hold a public hearing on the
matter, giving ten days notice to the land owner of its intention to commence
construction of the curbs and gutters and/or sidewalks, at which hearing the
land owner may appear and object and/or agree to forthwith comply with this
chapter.



   C.   If the land owner has not complied within thirty days of the
public hearing, then the city will proceed to install the curbs and gutters
and/or sidewalks; and upon completion thereof will hold another public
hearing, giving ten days' notice to the land owner, to assess the costs
thereof.



   D.   At the meeting, the costs shall be assessed and if the land
owner does not make payment within thirty days, a resolution establishing the
costs shall be recorded by the city in the office of the recorder of the
county and filed with the tax collector of the county, and shall then become
a lien upon the land involved. 



(Ord. 645, 1995; Ord. 521 § 1(part), 1987).



12.04.050  Engineering services.



   The city will make no additional charge for the engineering services in
regard to the design and grade of the curbs and gutters and/or sidewalks. 



(Ord. 521 § 1 (part), 1987).



12.04.060  Specifications.



   The city will furnish the engineering elevations for the curbs and
gutters and/or sidewalks to the land owner or his duly authorized contractor
or agent; and the curbs and gutters and/or sidewalks shall be installed to
the design grades established by the city engineer in accordance with the
Public Works Construction Standards. 



(Ord. § 1(part), 1987).



12.04.070  Additional remedies.



   The city reserves to itself any other remedies at law available at law
and shall not be limited by the lien provided for in this chapter. 



(Ord. 521 § 1(part), 1987).



12.04.080  Violation--penalty.



   Failure to comply with the requests set forth in this chapter shall be
deemed a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as such. 



(Ord. 521 § 1 (part), 1987).

   B.   If, however, a tree which is located on private property causes
damage to the curb and gutter, the property owner will be notified as
provided by law and advised to abate the problem and notified that failure to
remove the tree will cause the city to remove it at the property owner's
expense. If the property owner does not remove the tree within thirty days,

responsibility of the property owner and the city. Damaged sidewalks shall be
repaired or replaced at the discretion of the city; the city shall be
responsible for the first two hundred dollars of the costs; thereafter, the
city shall be liable for fifty percent of the remaining costs and the
property owner shall be liable for fifty percent of the remaining costs.
Trees, wherever located, which are determined by the Director of Public Works
to be cause of recurring damages to a particular sidewalk will be removed by
the city. Trees which are located within the city right-of-way, which are
causing damage to sidewalks, will be removed by the city at no cost to the
property owner. However, trees which are located on private property which
are causing damage to sidewalks will be removed by the city with the costs
charged to the property owner.



   B.   If a property owner petitions the city not to remove a
particular tree which has caused damage to sidewalk and/or curb and gutter,
and the city grants the petition, the property must bear the total cost of
all repairs to sidewalks, curbs and gutters, present and future at the sites
in question. 



(Ord. 620, 1993; Ord. 521 § 1 (part), 1987).

be subject to the approval of the city.



   B.   Trees located in the right-of-way shall be trimmed and
maintained by the city at the discretion of city crews as the need arises,
however, the property owner is encouraged to care for these trees also.



   C.   Trees will not be trimmed for beautification purposes on
request of the property owners.



   D.   If a tree located on private property has limbs protruding into
public right-of-way which are determined by the city to be a hazard, said
limbs only will be trimmed by city crews.  All other trimming of trees
located on private property will be the responsibility of the property owner.



   E.   Bushes, shrubs and tress are not to be planted or removed in
the city right-of-way unless specifically approved by the city.  Only those
trees which appear on the city's approved list of street trees will be
approved by the city.  Any new plantings not approved by the city shall be
removed by the property owner, or will be removed by the city at the property
owner's expense.

12.08.030  Permit--issuance.



   If the proposed work will not damage the city street or alley, will not
create a public hazard, and is acceptable to the director of public works,
the permit will be issued after being signed by the director. The permit will
set forth the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to the permit.
All work performed under the encroachment permit shall be in accordance with
the Gridley Public Works Construction Standards and the terms of the permit.
All public rights-of-way shall be restored to their original condition upon
completion of the work.

on, over or within the right-of-way of any city street or alley or on any
city-owned easement or property without first obtaining an encroachment
permit pursuant to this chapter (or obtaining an Encroachment Agreement
pursuant to Chapter 12.09).



   B.   A violation of this chapter is a public nuisance.  Any
building or structure erected, constructed, altered or maintained within the
right-of-way of any street or alley or on city-owned easement or property
contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall be and the same is declared
to be unlawful and a public nuisance.



   C.   The City Attorney may, by a civil action, commence necessary
proceedings for the abatement, removal and/or enjoinment thereof in the
manner provided by law.  Any person, firm or corporation violating the
provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Attorney may, in addition to any
other remedy, pursuant to a civil action, seek imposition of civil penalties
pursuant to Chapter 1.08 of this Code.  Specifically, by way of such civil
action, any person, firm or corporation found to have violated this chapter
may be assessed civil penalties not exceeding $50.00 for a first violation of
this chapter, civil penalties not exceeding $100.00 for a second violation of
this chapter and civil penalties not exceeding $250.00 for each additional
violation of this Chapter within one year.  The civil penalties imposed
shall be imposed for each and every day or any portion thereof wherein there
is any violation of any provision of this chapter with each day being a
separate offense.  (By way of example, a violation continuing for four (4)
successive days would be subject to civil penalties of $650.00, plus $250.00
for each additional day of violation thereafter).

   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for orderly development and
eliminate duplication and uncertainty; to enable emergency vehicles to
respond timely; to expedite postal and other delivery services; and to
conform with Butte County's uniform system of the naming of streets and
highways, adopted by Butte County's Ordinance No. 1874 on October 18, 1977. 



(Ord. 521 § 1(part), 1987).



12.16.020  Address coordinator.



   A.   The system shall be continued, enforced, operated and
maintained within the city by the public works director, referred to in this
chapter as address coordinator, and the property numbers assigned within such
area shall be in accordance with the system. It shall be the duty of the
address coordinator to notify all persons of the street name and number
assigned to each location, the requirements of this chapter that the numbers
be installed and maintained, and to determine whether the same are installed
in such a manner as to be visible from the street in front of each location
or from the street or driveway leading to buildings that are removed a
substantial distance from the public street or road which the subject site
abuts.



   B.   The address coordinator shall make sure that all new street
names avoid duplication and do not sound like existing street or road names
in the city and county.



   C.   The address coordinator shall issue to any building owner or
occupant in the city upon request, a number or numbers in accordance with
this chapter.



   D.   The address coordinator shall be responsible for maintaining
the numbering and road naming system and shall keep a record of all numbers
and names assigned under this chapter. The records shall be open for
inspection by the public during regular business hours. 



(Ord. 521 § 1(part), 1987).



12.16.030  Street signs.



   A.   A street sign, arranged such that the names of the intersecting
streets are parallel to the corresponding street and facing the same from the
south or east side of the street, shall be provided in accordance with the
street sign and location standards on file in the office of the director of
public works.



   B.   Street name signs for existing city streets will be erected and
maintained by the department of public works.



   C.   Street name signs for new city streets established by
subdivisions and site improvements shall be supplied and erected, to the
city's standards, by the person constructing the subdivision or improvements.
The department of public works will maintain the signs thereafter. 



(Ord. 521 § 1(part), 1987).



12.16.040  Street naming procedure.



   A.   All streets or roads shall be known by the same name for the
entire length or as noted or determined by the city council. Sycamore Street

   B.   All street names will be reviewed by the address coordinator
before being submitted to the city council.



   C.   When naming or renaming any street, access or easement, the
address coordinator will have the right to select a name for the street,
access or easement, in conformance with Butte County Ordinance Number 1874.



   D.   Any new city street may be officially named upon petition to
the address coordinator in the form of a map showing, location and alignment
of the street to be named. These names will be studied to assure that they do
not duplicate or sound like any existing street names in the city or county.
If one of these street names does not conflict with any existing street
names, this name will be recommended to the city council in the form of a
resolution. Upon approval by the city council, thereafter such street shall
be officially known by the name so designated. 



(Ord. 521 § 1(part), 1987).



12.16.050  Addressing procedure.



   A.   All addresses will be assigned or reassigned in accordance with
the appropriate area and in normal sequence to its respective block.



   B.   Mobile home parks, condominiums, shopping centers, or

enters, unless otherwise directed by the public works director.



      2.   Street names will not be permitted.



      3.   Each space or apartment will be assigned an address
number, space number, or apartment number by the address coordinator.



      4.   The owner or developer of this type of development will
supply the address coordinator with a small map showing all the spaces or
apartments and interior streets to allow numbers to be assigned. Recommended
scale of this small map is one inch equals two hundred feet. A copy will then
be sent to each emergency agency and post office for their use.



      5.   At all intersections in this type of development there
shall be a sign showing the address number, space or apartment number range
ahead on the streets.

   B.   Within sixty days of such effective date of notice of number
assigned or reassigned, the occupant(s) or owner(s) of the building shall
cause the number to be displayed upon the building or land in such a manner
as to be visible from the street or road upon which the land or building
fronts, and shall remove or obscure from public view and old or previous
number not in accordance with the system.



   C.   The minimum height of numbers to be used shall be three inches
and contrasting color from the basic background. Arabic numerals shall be
used except in the instance of multiplex units having a single Arabic numeral
but in need of Roman numbers to designate particular units.

12.16.070  Numbering system.



   A.   Except for the following streets and highways as listed below,
the present block system for numbering streets that exist within the city
limits shall remain. Newly annexed areas shall conform, as will all
structures fronting upon city-maintained streets that lie within the county
island areas of the city, to the city block numbering system.



      1.   State Highway 99, East Gridley Road, West Biggs- Gridley
Road, Bonnell Avenue, Obermeyer Avenue and Archer Avenue shall be readdressed
by the county of Butte's method of numbering streets. Every one thousand
three hundred twenty feet shall be allotted one hundred numbers.



      2.   State Highway 99 will begin with "0" at the south county
line and increase in number therefrom. East Gridley Road numbering will begin
with "0" at State Highway 99 and increase easterly in number therefrom. The
West Biggs-Gridley Road numbering system will begin with City block number
1600, at its intersection with Sycamore Street, and increase in number, in a
northerly direction, therefrom.



      3.   Obermeyer Avenue and Archer Avenue numbering will begin
as "0" at State Highway 99 and increase easterly therefrom.

therefrom.



   B.   The even numbers will always be on the right-hand side in all
directions, on all streets, when looking toward the higher numbers.



   C.   The city shall furnish all street signs to be erected under
this chapter. All house numbers and commercial or industrial property numbers
shall be provided and placed on the real property at the expense of the
owner(s). Failure to do so shall be an infraction and will be punishable as
such.

   A.   Establishment of credit. Each applicant for which utility
service is requested from the city shall be required to establish credit with
the city in the following manner:



      1.   The applicant shall make a cash deposit with the city to
secure the payment of any bills for services to be furnished by the city
under the application.



      2.   If an applicant has previously been a consumer of city
utilities and has paid all previous bills in a timely manner for a period of
three consecutive years immediately prior to the date the applicant
previously ceased to take service from the city, provided such service
occurred within one year from the date of new application for service, then
credit shall be deemed to be established without the requirement of a cash
deposit.



      3.   Establishment and re-establishment of credit is more
fully described in the city policy "Late Fees and Deposits" which may be
modified from time to time.



   B.   Re-establishment of credit.



      1.   An applicant who previously has been a customer of the
city and whose utility service has been discontinued by the city because of
nonpayment of utility charges or other reasons, shall be required to
re-establish credit by paying a deposit, all prior remaining unpaid charges
and by paying utility bills when regularly due.



      2.   A customer who fails to pay bills before they become past
due shall be required to pay the delinquent portion of said bill and any late
charges prescribed by the city.



      3.   Whenever, for nonpayment of utility bills, or for other
just reason, the service of any user of city utilities has been severed, the
customer will be required to deposit an amount equal to three times the
average estimated monthly bill to re-establish credit.



      4.   Re-establishment of credit by a customer who fails to pay
bills under this section shall apply to all accounts in the name of the
customer, residential or commercial, and to any new accounts which the
customer wishes to establish during the period in which the customer is
establishing credit. This section applies to tenants as well as property
owners.



   C.   Deposit required for utility applicants whose electrical meter
seals have been broken or whose water meters have been tampered with in an
unauthorized manner.



      1.   Tampering: Whenever, for nonpayment of utility bills, or
for other just reason, the service of any user of city utilities has been
severed, and the electrical meter seal is removed by persons other than
authorized employees of the city, or if the water meter is turned on or
tampered with, the person to whom said meter is assigned by account shall not
be furnished utility service again within the city without first paying all
unpaid utility bills, together with any penalties and charges associated with
the meter tampering.



         (a)   The utilities of said applicant shall be shut off
until such time as a deposit, amount to be determined by the city, is paid,
together with the penalty for meter tampering and any other applicable
charges shown in the current city fee schedule (note: if the water and
electrical meters to a property are both tampered with, then multiple
penalties may apply).



         (b)   If the city finds that the customer continues to
tamper with his meter or meters in any effort to secure service which has
been discontinued, the city may permanently shut off services until such time
as tampering charges and or penalties are paid.  The fees will be set in
accordance with the current city fee schedule, which shall be amended by
resolution. Tampering charges must be paid before services are reconnected to
the property.  In lieu of the tampering penalties, a reconnection charge for
either service should apply equal to the cost of reconnecting the services.



      2.   The person or persons to whom water or electric meters
are assigned by account shall be liable for said meters in the event that
meters under the control of and/or assigned to said applicant are either
unsealed or otherwise tampered with. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.020  Deposits.



   A.   The amount of deposit to establish or to re-establish credit
for specified city utility users for any combination of city utility services
(electric, water, and sewer) shall be established by resolution of the City
Council.



   B.   An applicant for a new commercial account may request a review
of the amount of the electrical deposit based upon projected differences in
the amount of electrical consumption in the structure. Likewise, the City
Administrator, or their designee, may determine that the amount of the
deposit for a new commercial account should be increased or decrease based
upon projected differences in the amount of electrical consumption in the
structure which would warrant an increase (or decrease) in the deposit. Such
review shall consider changes in intensity of use, hours of operation,
installed electrical equipment and other factors which would justify an
increase or a decrease in the amount of the deposit. The amount of the
deposit for commercial accounts may be modified by the City Administrator.



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.030  Return of deposits.



   A.   When the customer has received continuous service and has paid
his utility bills in a timely manner for a period of 36 consecutive months
from the inception of services or from the last date of delinquency, the
deposit will be returned after that 36-month period of time. No interest will
be paid on deposits.



   B.   When a deposit has been collected from a consumer as a result
of his service being discontinued for nonpayment of his utility account, said
deposit shall be retained by the city until such time as the city, at its
discretion, is convinced that said consumer has established a satisfactory
credit status with the city, but no sooner than 36 months following the
initial date of payment of the full deposit.



   C.   When a consumer who has such a deposit with the city orders his
service discontinued, the deposit will be returned unless there are charges
due the city for utility services.  In such case, the deposit will be
applied to the charges and the excess portion of the deposit, if any, will be
returned to the customer. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)

      1.   Meters will be read as required for the preparation of
regular bills, opening bills, closing bills and other reasons deemed
necessary by the city.



      2.   It may not be possible to always read meters on the same
day of the month, and should a monthly billing period contain less than 27
days or more than 33 days, a pro rata computation in the bill will be made.



   C.   Pro rata computation.



      1.   Except as provided below, all bills for electric service
rendered for periods of less than 27 days or more than 33 days on a monthly
billing period, will be computed in accordance with the applicable schedule.
The size of the energy blocks, and the amount of the customer charge, service
charge, demand charge, or minimum charge, specified therein, will be prorated
on the basis of the ratio of the number of days in the period to the number
of days in an average bimonthly or monthly period, which, for this purpose,
shall be taken as 30 days.



      2.   When the total period of service is less than 34 days, no
proration will be made, and no bill for such a service period shall be less
than the specified monthly customer charge, service charge, demand charge, or
minimum charge, except, when temporary service is furnished and the customer
has paid the estimated cost of installing and removing the service
facilities, proration will be made. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.050  Reading of separate meters not combined.



   For the purpose of billing, each meter upon the customer's premises
will be considered separately, and the readings of two or more meters will
not be combined except as follows:



   A.   Where combinations of meter readings are specifically provided
for in the rate schedule.



   B.   Where the city's operating convenience requires the use of more
than one meter.



   C.   A water meter and an electric meter may be included in a
consolidated billing. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.060  Payment of bills.



   A.   All bills are due and payable on presentation, and payment
should be made at the city's finance office.



   B.   Partial payments do not constitute full payment nor will a
partial payment prevent services from being terminated. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.070  Notices.



   A.   Notices to customers. When notices from the city to a customer
are required, they will normally be given in writing, either mailed to the
customer's mailing address or delivered to him, except that in emergencies,
the city may give oral notices.



   B.   Notices from customers. Notices from a customer to the city
will be given by written communication mailed to the city's office. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.080  Disputed bills.



   When a customer and the city fail to agree on a bill for electric
service and the disputed bill is not paid by the 20th day after the city
mails the bill, the city will notify the customer in writing that:



   A.   In lieu of paying the disputed bill, he may deposit with the
Finance Department the amount claimed by the city to be due.



   B.   Checks or other forms of remittance acceptable to the city for
such deposit should be made payable to the city.



   C.   Upon receipt of the deposit the Finance Department will notify
the City Administrator of the disputed bill. The City Administrator will
review the disputed bill and make a determination of the disputed amounts.



   D.   Service will not be discontinued for nonpayment of the disputed
bill when deposit has been made with the city pending the outcome of the
review.



   E.   Failure of the customer to make such deposit within 20 days
after the date upon which notice (when the original monthly bill is
presented) was given will warrant discontinuance of his service without
further notice.



   F.   If before completion of the City Administrator's review,
additional bills become due which the customer wishes to dispute, he shall
also deposit with the city Finance Department the additional amounts claimed
by the city to be due for such bills before they become past due and that
failure to do so will warrant discontinuance of this service as provided by
this chapter. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.090  Discontinuance and restoration of service.



   A.   Past due bills.  When bills are rendered monthly, they will be
considered past due if not paid within 20 days after presentation.



   B.   Nonpayment of bills.



      1.   When a bill for utility service has become past due and a
15-day discontinuance of service notice for nonpayment has been presented,
service will be discontinued if the bill is not paid within the time required
by such notice. In addition, no less than  48 hours prior to the impending
termination the city shall mail a final notice of termination of service.



      2.   A customer's service will be discontinued for nonpayment
of a bill for service previously rendered him at any location served by the
city provided such bill is not paid within ten days after date of
presentation of a notice that present service will be discontinued for
nonpayment of such bill for prior service.



      3.   If a customer is receiving more than one service, any or
all services may be discontinued when any service, regardless of location, is
discontinued for nonpayment.



   C.   Unsafe electrical equipment.



      1.   The city may refuse to provide, or discontinue, service
to a customer if any part of his wiring or other equipment, or use thereof,
is determined by the city to be unsafe or in violation of applicable laws,
ordinances, rules or regulations of the city, or if any condition existing
upon the customer's premises is determined to endanger the city's service
facilities, until the unsafe conditions are corrected or the violation
remedied.



      2.   The city does not assume any responsibility for
inspecting or repairing the customer's wiring or other equipment, or any part
thereof, and assumes no liability therefore.



   D.   Service detrimental to other customers.  The city will not
provide electric service to equipment, the operation of which would prove
detrimental to the service of the city or its other customers, and will
discontinue electric service to any customer who continues to operate such
equipment after having been given notice to cease by the city.



   E.   Fraud. The city may refuse to provide, or discontinue, service
if the acts of the customer or the conditions upon his premises indicate
intent to defraud the city.



   F.   Failure to establish or re-establish credit. If, for an
applicant's convenience, the city should provide service before credit is
established or should continue service to a customer when credit has not been
re-established in accordance with this chapter, and he fails to establish or
re-establish his credit after the date of presentation of a written notice of
not less than ten days, the city may discontinue service.



   G.   Noncompliance. Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this chapter, the city may discontinue service to a customer for
noncompliance with fee schedules if, after written notice of at least eight
days, he has not complied with the notice. The city may dispense with the
giving of such notice in the event of a dangerous condition which makes the
immediate discontinuance of service to the premises imperative.



   H.   Customer's request for service discontinuance.



      1.   When a customer desires to terminate his responsibility
for service, he shall give the city not less than three day's notice of his
intention and state the date on which he wishes the termination to become
effective. A customer may be held responsible for all service furnished at
the premises until three days after receipt of such notice by the city or
until the date of termination specified in the notice, whichever date is
later.



      2.   Any request for service discontinuation of less than
three days notice will require the application of a call-out charge as
specified in the city's fee schedule.



   I.   Returned item charge. If an item (check, electronic bank
transfer, money order or other legal tender) tendered in payment of amounts
owing the city, is not honored by a bank and is returned to the city unpaid,
the city will add to the customer's bill a charge for processing each such
returned item in accordance with the current city fee schedule, which
schedule may be amended by resolution of City Council. Where service is
subject to discontinuance pursuant to this chapter, the fee for the returned
check shall be included in the total amount due and payable. Returned checks
shall be redeemed in cash, money order or cashier's check. In addition, if
more than two checks are returned by the bank for any reason on a single
account during a six month period, personal or company checks will no longer
be acceptable for payment of utility bills on that account. In addition,
personal or company checks will not be accepted for any other utility
accounts or other city obligations under the name of the customer for a
period of no less than 36 months or until credit is reestablished.



   J.   Notice of service discontinuance charge, final notice charge,
24 hour notice charge and late charges.



      1.   The city will require payment of the notice of service
discontinuance charge, the final notice charge, 24 hour notice charge, any
late charge and applicable interest charges in accordance with the current
city fee schedule, which schedule may be amended by resolution of the City
Council.



      2.   The authorized city representative who makes a field call
to the customer's premises may not accept payment or make arrangements for
payment and must carry out the disconnection order; the customer must contact
the Finance Department to make all payments.



   K.   Reconnection charge.



      1.   The city will require payment of a reconnect charge in
addition to any and all outstanding charges on the customer's account in
accordance with the current city fee schedule, which schedule may be amended
by resolution of the City Council, before restoring service that has been
discontinued for nonpayment of bills or tampering with city equipment.



      2.   In cases where customers request that service be
reconnected outside of regular service hours (after 10:30 a.m. weekdays or
anytime on weekends), an additional call-out charge will be applied to the
customer's account in accordance with the current city fee schedule.



      3.   In addition, the city may charge and collect any unusual
costs incidental to the discontinuance or restoration of service when they
have resulted from the customer's action or negligence.



      4.   Service wrongfully terminated will be restored without
charge and a notification thereof will be mailed to the customer at the
billing address.



   L.   Appeal process.  Inability to pay due to extreme circumstances
beyond the control of the customer, and not due to habitual nonpayment of
bills, may be grounds for an appeal hearing before the Finance Director. 
The Finance Director may, as he/she deems appropriate, receive testimony from
the customer and or city staff. The decision of the Finance Director may be
appealed to the City Administrator, whose decision is final. The City
Administrator may allow additional time for payment and or establish a
payment plan for the delinquent customer to become current, or may deny the
appeal. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 7 (part), 2009)



13.02.100  Meter tests and adjustment of bills for meter error.



   A.   Tests.



      1.   Prior to installation. Every electrical and water meter
will be tested at or prior to the time of installation, and no meter will be
placed in service if found to register more than 1% fast or l% slow.



      2.   On customer request.



         (a)   A customer may, with advance notice of not less
than one week, request the city to test the meter for his service.



         (b)   No charge will be made for such a test, but,
should a customer request a test within 12 months after installation, or more
often than once in 12 months, he will be required to pay a deposit in
accordance with the city's fee schedule, to pay in part, the cost of the
test.  This deposit will be returned if the meter is found to register more
than 2% fast or 2% slow.



   B.   Adjustment of bills for meter error.



      1.   Fast meters. When, upon test, any meter is found to be
registering more than 2% fast, the city will refund to the customer the
amount of the overcharge based on corrected meter readings for the preceding
six months, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4. hereof.



      2.   Slow meters. When, upon test, any meter is found to be
registering more than 2% slow, the city may bill the customer for the amount
of the undercharge based on corrected meter readings for the preceding one
year, subject to provisions of paragraph 4. hereof.



      3.   Nonregistering meters.



         (a)   When, upon test, any meter is found to be
nonregistering, the city may bill the customer for the estimated amount of
electricity and water consumed but not registered for a period of three
months, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4. hereof.



         (b)   Bills for this purpose will be estimated from
customer's prior use, the customer's subsequent use correctly metered, the
city experience with other customers of the same class, and the general
characteristics of the customer's operations.



      4.   General. When it is found that the error in a meter is
due to identifiable causes, the date of which can be reliably established,
the overcharge or the undercharge will be computed back to but not beyond
that date, provided, however, that in no case will a bill for undercharge on
service schedules be rendered for a period exceeding three years.



   C.   In no event will the request for testing of a meter prevent the
termination of services due to non-payment of utility charges.

Treatment Works, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;



      3.   To protect both Publicly Owned Treatment Works personnel
who may be affected by industrial wastewater and sludge in the course of
their employment and the general public;



      4.   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater
and sludge from the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;



      5.   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the
cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works; and



      6.   To enable the City of Gridley to comply with its Waste
Discharge Permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any
other Federal or State laws to which the Publicly Owned Treatment Works is
subject.

or any terms of the industrial wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.



   B.   Industrial wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon
cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All industrial
wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular user are void upon the
issuance of a new industrial wastewater discharge permit to that user.



13.06.260  Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance



   A user with an expiring industrial wastewater discharge permit shall
apply for industrial wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a
complete permit application, in accordance with Section 13.06.170 of this
chapter, a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the user's
existing industrial wastewater discharge permit.



13.06.270  Regulation of Waste Received from Other Jurisdictions



   A.   If another municipality, or user located within another
municipality, contributes industrial wastewater to the POTW, the Director of
Public Works shall enter into an intermunicipal agreement with the

established schedule; and



   D.   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Director of Public Works.



13.06.300  Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline



   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of industrial wastewater into the
POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the Director of Public Works a report containing the information
described in Section 13.06.280 (B) (4-6) of this chapter. For users subject
to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the
procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure
of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with Section 13.06.180 of this chapter.



13.06.310  Periodic Compliance Reports



   A.   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency
determined by the Director of Public Works but in no case less than twice per
year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.06.180 of this chapter.



   B.   All industrial wastewater samples must be representative of the
user's discharge. Industrial wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring
facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim
that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.



   C.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Director of
Public Works, using the procedures prescribed in Section 13.06.380 of this
chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.



13.06.320  Reports of Changed Conditions



   A.   Each user must notify the Director of Public Works of any
planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality, or volume of its industrial wastewater at least
ten (10) days before the change.



   B.   The Director of Public Works may require the user to submit
such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of an industrial wastewater discharge
permit application under Section 13.06.170 of this chapter.



   C.   The Director of Public Works may issue an industrial wastewater
discharge permit under Section 13.06.190 of this chapter or modify an
existing industrial wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.06.230 of
this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.



   D.   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include,
but are not limited to, flow increases of ten percent (10%) or greater, and
the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.



13.06.330  Reports of Potential Problems



   A.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential
problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Director of Public Works of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste,* concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the user.



   B.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Director of Public Works, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which
may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this chapter.



   C.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event
of a discharge described in paragraph A, above. Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.



13.06.340  Reports from Unpermitted Users



   All users not required to obtain an industrial wastewater discharge
permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Director of Public Works as
the Director of Public Works may require.



13.06.350  Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting



   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must
notify the Director of Public Works within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director of Public Works
within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is
not required to resample if the Director of Public Works monitors at the
user's facility at least once a month, or if the Director of Public Works
samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the
results of this sampling.



13.06.360  Discharge of Hazardous Waste Prohibited



   No hazardous waste shall be discharged to the Gridley POTW in amounts
that cause problems or adverse impacts.



13.06.370  Analytical Requirements



   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of an industrial wastewater discharge permit application or report
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR
Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. if 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.



13.06.380  Sample Collection



   A.   Except as indicated in Section B, below, the user must collect
industrial wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Director of Public Works may authorize the use of time proportional sampling
or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this
will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits.



   B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.



13.06.390  Timing



   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.



13.06.400  Record Keeping



   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time
of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the City of Gridley, or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the Director of Public Works.



13.06.410  Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling



   A.   The Director of Public Works shall have the right to enter the
premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this chapter and any industrial wastewater discharge permit
or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Director of Public Works
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any
additional duties.



   B.   Where a user has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the Director of Public Works will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.



   C.   The Director of Public Works shall have the right to set up on
the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.



   D.   The Director of Public Works may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
industrial wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually
to ensure their accuracy.



   E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the Director of Public Works and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the
user.



   F.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.



13.06.420  Search Warrants



   If the Director of Public Works has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the City of Gridley designed to verify compliance
with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Director
of Public Works may seek issuance of a search warrant from a court of
appropriate jurisdiction.



13.06.430  Confidential Information



   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
industrial wastewater discharge permit applications, industrial wastewater
discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Director of Public
Works's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public
without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State
law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be
made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Industrial wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40
CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be
available to the public without restriction.



13.06.440  Publication Of Users In Significant Noncompliance



   The Director of Public Works shall publish annually, in the largest
daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a
list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in
significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:



   A.   Chronic violations of industrial wastewater discharge limits,
defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of industrial
wastewater measurements taken during a six(6) month period exceed the daily
maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;



   B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of industrial wastewater
measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period
equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit
multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);



   C.   Any other discharge violation that the Director of Public Works
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW
personnel or the general public;



   D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
Director of Public Works's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or
prevent such a discharge;



   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date,
a compliance schedule milestone contained in an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;



   F.   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date,
any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic
self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;



   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or



   H.   Any other violation(s) which the Director of Public Works
determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.



13.06.450  Notification of Violation



   When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may serve upon that
user a written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions,
shall be submitted by the user to the Director of Public Works. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the Director of Public Works to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a Notice of Violation.



13.06.460  Consent Orders



   The Director of Public Works may enter into Consent Orders, assurances
of voluntary compliance, or other  similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
Sections 13.06.480 and 13.06.490 of this chapter and shall be judicially
enforceable.



13.06.470  Show Cause Hearing



   The Director of Public Works may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, to appear before the Director of Public Works and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting,
the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request
that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to
the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of
the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.



13.06.480  Compliance Orders



   When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed
and properly operated.



   Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.



13.06.490  Cease and Desist Orders



   A.   When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past
violations are likely to recur, the Director of Public Works may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:



      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and



      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.



   B.   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



13.06.500  Administrative Fines



   A.   When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an
industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may
fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be
assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.



   B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30)
calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 25 percent (25%) of the
unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 0.83
percent (0.83%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought
for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.



   C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the Director of Public Works to reconsider the fine along with
full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of
the fine. Where a request has merit, the Director of Public Works may convene
a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the
payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to
the user. The Director of Public Works may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.



   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



13.06.510  Emergency Suspensions



   A.   The Director of Public Works may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Director of Public Works may also immediately suspend
a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens
to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may
present, an endangerment to the environment.



      1.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Director of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, groundwater, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director of
Public Works may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Section 13.06.520 of this chapter are initiated against the user.



      2.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of Public Works prior
to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 13.06.470
or 13.06.520 of this chapter.



   B.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.



13.06.520  Termination of Discharge



   A.   In addition to the provisions in Section 13.06.250 of this
chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:



      1.   Violation of industrial wastewater discharge permit
conditions;



      2.   Failure to accurately report the industrial wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge;



      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
industrial wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to
discharge;



      4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for
the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or



      5.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Sections
13.06.050 - 13.06.090 of this chapter.



   B.   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 13.06.470
of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this
option by the Director of Public Works shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



13.06.530  Injunctive Relief



   When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may petition a court of
appropriate jurisdiction through the City's Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the industrial wastewater discharge permit,
order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the
user. The Director of Public Works may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.



13.06.540  Civil Penalties



   A.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision
of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable
to the City of Gridley for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation,
per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.



   B.   The Director of Public Works may recover reasonable attorneys'
fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of-any actual
damages incurred by the City of Gridley.



   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any
other factor as justice requires.



   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.



13.06.550  Criminal Prosecution



   A.   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than
$1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6)
months, or both.



   B.   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at

or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for
personal injury or property damage available under State law.



   C.   A user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan,
or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this
chapter, industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per
day, or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.



   D.   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished
by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for
not more than one (1) year, or both.



13.06.560  Remedies Nonexclusive



   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The
Director of Public Works may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the City's enforcement response plan.
However, the Director of Public Works may take other action against any user
when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Director of Public Works is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user.



13.06.570  Performance Bonds



   The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or reissue an
industrial wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply
with any provision of this chapter, a previous industrial wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond,
payable to the City of Gridley, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by
the Director of Public Works to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.



13.06.580  Liability Insurance



   The Director of Public Works may decline to issue or reissue an
industrial wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply
with any' provision of this chapter, a previous industrial wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has
obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the
POTW caused by its discharge.



13.06.590  Water Supply Severance



   Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service
to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's
expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.



13.06.600  Public Nuisances



   A violation of any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and may be
corrected or abated as directed by the Director of Public Works. Any
person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of
the Gridley Municipal Code Chapter 8.10 (Sections 8.10.090-8.10.120
inclusive), governing the abatement of nuisances.



13.06.610  Contractor Listing



   Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award
for the sale of goods or services to the City of Gridley. Existing contracts
for the sale of goods or services to the City of Gridley held by a user found
to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or
requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the Director of Public
Works.



13.06.620  Upset



   A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless
or improper operation.



   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.



   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs,
or other relevant evidence that:



      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;



      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and



      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the
Director of Public Works within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the upset [if this information is provided orally, a written submission must
be provided within five (5) days]:



         a.   A description. of the indirect discharge and cause
of noncompliance;



         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and



         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.



   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.



13.06.630  Prohibited Discharge Standards



   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section
13.06.050 (A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in Sections
13.06.050 (B) (3) through (B)(20) of this chapter if it can prove that it did
not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction
with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference
and that either:



   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or



   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the City of Gridley was regularly in compliance with its Waste Discharge
Requirements, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with
applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.



13.06.640  Bypass



   A.   For the purposes of this section,



      1.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams
from any portion of a user's treatment facility.



      2.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



   B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section.



   C.   1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Director of Public Works, at least ten (10)
days before the date of the bypass, if possible.



      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public
Works of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of
the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Director of Public Works may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis
if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.



   D.   1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works
may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless



         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage;



         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



         c.   The user submitted notices as required under
paragraph (C) of this section.



      2.   The Director of Public Works may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director of Public
Works determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph
(D) (1) of this section.



13.06.650  Industrial Wastewater Charges and Fees



   The City of Gridley may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of
costs of setting up and operating the City's Industrial Wastewater Program
which may include:



   A.   Fees for industrial wastewater discharge permit applications
including the cost of processing such applications;



   B.   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;



   C.   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;



   D.   Fees for filing appeals; and



   E.   Other fees as the City of Gridley may deem necessary to carry
out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the
matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines,
and penalties chargeable by the City of Gridley.



13.06.660  Severability



   If any provision of this chapter is invalidated by any court of
competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be effected and
shall continue in full force and effect.



13.06.670  Effective Date



   This chapter shall be in full force and effect immediately following
its passage, approval, and publication, as provided by law.



Chapter 13.08 Sewer Fees*



   13.08.010   Sewer capacity fee.



   13.08.020   Sewer collector fee.



   13.08.030   Sewer lateral fee.



   13.08.040   Sewer permit fee.



   13.08.050   Sewer service charges.



   13.08.055   Sewer connection charges



   13.08.060   Costs for additional facilities.



   13.08.070   Special agreement required outside city limits.



   13.08.080   Violation--Penalty.



   13.08.090   Charges constituting a lien/procedures to lien.



13.08.010  Sewer capacity fee.



   A.   The city users of the sewer system and property owners have
borne the costs for the existing sewer system in the city which includes
treatment plants, sewer pump stations, sewer ponds, manholes and mains and
other related maintenance materials and equipment.  New connections by
owners of property or proposed users of the sewer system will involve use of
the capacity of these existing sewerage facilities which were paid for, or
have been constructed for, and are owned by the city.



   B.   Therefore, a sewer capacity fee must be paid to the city for
any connection to the city sewerage system, which will result in an increase
in sewer volumes or flows.  The charge for sewer capacity fee, which is a
one time charge collected with the building permit, shall be as specified in
Section 13.08.055.  These fees shall also be reflected in the Master Fee
Schedule separately adopted by resolution of the city council.



   C.   The fees collected are to be placed in a fund to be used for
capital improvements to the sewer system.  The current fund and account to
which this fee will be applied is 660-3641.  The fund balance of this fund
will be reserved for capital improvement projects.



   D.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the capacity fee will be evaluated annually.  Any cumulative increase in the
Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI) from the CCI used
for the existing fee amount resulting in a rate change of at least $25 shall
be presented to the city council in a public hearing by the first regular
council meeting in March of each year for review and possible adjustment by
ordinance.  Any adjustment shall be further reflected in the Master Fee
Schedule as adopted by resolution of the city council effective April 1 of
that year.  The minimum fee change shall be $25 reflecting the cumulative
CCI change from the CCI used for the currently published fee.



   E.   The CCI (or its successor) published in January for December of
the previous year shall be the index used for determining any rate change. 
The initial CCI for the purposes of this fee is 6825 as published in the
January 2004 Engineering News Record. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988; Ord. 727, 2004).



13.08.020  Sewer collector fee.



   A.   Each property which is proposed to be sewered will be served by
a public street, an alley, or sewer easement which is adjacent to the
property to be served.  Initial construction costs of the collector sewer
main must be borne by the property owners to be served.



   B.   Persons desiring to connect directly to an existing collector
sewer main must pay a sewer collector fee to the city, which was installed
without direct or indirect cost to the connecting property.  The charge for
sewer collector fee, which is collected with the building permit, shall be as
specified in Section 13.08.055.  These fees shall also be reflected in the
Master Fee Schedule separately adopted by resolution of the city council.



   C.   Persons installing collector sewer main infrastructure in order
to connect to existing collector sewer mains or having such infrastructure
installed by the city or by city contract shall pay the full cost of the
installation.  If the property developer does installation, such
installation shall be in lieu of payment of the then current sewer collector
fee.  If installation is done by the city or by city contract, the property
developer shall reimburse the city for costs incurred for such installation,
in lieu of payment of the then current sewer collector fee.



   D.   The sewer collector funds are to be placed in the sewer
operating fund to offset operating expenses.  The current fund and account
to which this fee will be applied is 650-3641.



   E.   If an existing collector sewer is not present, the connecting
property owner(s) shall bear the full cost of constructing or extending the
desired distribution and/or collection lines.



   F.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the collector fee will be evaluated annually.  Any cumulative increase in
the Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI) from the CCI
used for the existing fee amount resulting in a rate change of at least $25
shall be presented to the city council in a public hearing by the first
regular council meeting in March of each year for review and possible
adjustment by ordinance. Any adjustment shall be further reflected in the
Master Fee Schedule as adopted by resolution of the city council effective
April 1 of that year.  The minimum fee change shall be $25 reflecting the
cumulative CCI change from the CCI used for the currently published fee.



   G.   The CCI (or its successor) published in January for December of
the previous year shall be the index used for determining any rate change. 
The initial CCI for the purposes of this fee is 6825 as published in the
January 2004 Engineering News Record. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988; Ord. 727, 2004).



13.08.030  Sewer lateral fee.



   A.   Each property which is proposed to be sewered will be served by
a sewer lateral which extends from the collector sewer to the property or
easement line. Initial construction costs of the sewer lateral must be borne
by the property to be served.



   B.   Persons desiring to connect directly to an existing collector
sewer main must pay a sewer collector fee to the city, which was installed
without direct or indirect cost to the connecting property.  The charge for
sewer collector fee, which is collected with the building permit, shall be as
specified in Section 13.08.055.  These fees shall also be reflected in the
Master Fee Schedule separately adopted by resolution of the city council.



   C.   Persons installing collector sewer main infrastructure in order
to connect to existing collector sewer mains or having such infrastructure
installed by the city or by city contract shall pay the full cost of the
installation.  If the property developer does installation, such
installation shall be in lieu of payment of the then current sewer collector
fee.  If installation is done by the city or by city contract, the property
developer shall reimburse the city for costs incurred for such installation,
in lieu of payment of the then current sewer collector fee.



   D.   The sewer collector funds are to be placed in the sewer

13.08.060  Costs for additional facilities.



   A.   Whenever sewer service to a property requires construction of
more than one hundred feet of off-site sewer line to the property, or
construction of a sewer pump station or other unusual sewer facilities, these
costs must be borne by the person or properties to be served.



   B.   However, if these additional facilities will potentially serve
other properties, the city may enter into a reimbursement agreement to refund
a portion of these costs. The refund amount will be based on the sewer
connection fees received by the city. Reimbursement payments will be made
based upon forty percent of the sewer capacity and collector fees received
from properties served by the facilities included in the reimbursement
agreement by the city within the fiscal year after completion and acceptance
by the city, and each fiscal year thereafter.



   C.   The amount reimbursed by the city shall not exceed the amount
specified in the reimbursement agreement. The agreement shall be for a period
not to exceed ten years. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.08.070  Special agreement required outside city limits.

13.08.080  Violation--Penalty.



   A.   The wilful misrepresentation of any material fact with
knowledge of its falsity or without reasonable cause to believe it to be
true, to any city officer or the city council with the intent thereby to
influence official action herein, shall be a violation of this chapter.



   B.   Any person, firm or corporation violating any provisions of
this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof
shall be punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or by
imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
Such person, firm, or corporation shall be deemed guilty of a separate
offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of
this chapter is committed, continued or permitted by such person, firm, or
corporation and shall be punishable as provided in this section. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.08.090  Charges constituting a lien/procedures to lien.



   A.   The sewer service or connection charges imposed pursuant to
these regulations constitute a lien upon the parcel of real property to which
such service was rendered.



   B.   Lien recorded-Procedure.



      1.   Notwithstanding any provision in this code to the
contrary, any sewer service charges which have become delinquent shall cause
the owner of such property to be subject to a lien on the property pursuant
to the procedure provided in this section. Any such lien shall be recorded
with the county recorder.



      2.   Prior to the recordation of a lien for delinquent
charges, the Finance Director shall cause the notice of an opportunity for
hearing on the delinquent charges to be mailed to the owner. For purposes of
this section, the term "owner" shall have the meaning given it in these
regulations. If the owner desires a hearing thereon, he shall request such a
hearing by notifying the City Clerk thereof in writing within ten days after
the date shown on the notice. Any such hearing shall be set not earlier than
ten days after receipt of the owner's request. The hearing shall be held
before the City Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final and
conclusive



      3.   At the expiration of the time within which to request a
hearing, or upon a decision adverse to the owner after hearing, the City
Council shall cause such lien to be recorded with the county recorder in the
form and manner prescribed by law. Thereafter, such lien shall not be
released by the Finance Director unless and until it is fully and completely
paid or an acceptable arrangement with the city has been agreed to by the
city.



      4.   The Finance Director is authorized to determine the
administrative cost of the delinquency, including costs associated with
processing the delinquent account, which will be subject to an individual
lien pursuant to the recording procedures of this section. Delinquent charges
will be collected as a special assessment. Not less often than once a year,
the Finance Director may initiate proceedings to make delinquent sewer
service/ connection charges a special assessment against the parcels of
property to which such service was rendered.



      5.   The Finance Director shall transmit through the City
Administrator to Council, a report of delinquent charges.



      6.   Hearing: Upon receipt of the report, the City
Administrator shall fix a time, date and place for the City Council to hear
the report, and any protests or objections thereto. At the time fixed for
consideration of the report, the Council shall hear it along with any
objections of the property owners liable to be assessed for delinquent
accounts. The Council may make such revisions, corrections, or modifications
to the report as it may deem just; and in the event the Council is satisfied
with the correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or
modified), it shall be confirmed or rejected by resolution. The decision of
the City Council on the report and on all protests or objections thereto
shall be final and conclusive.



      7.   Method of collection; applicability of other liens, laws,
etc.



         (a)   Upon confirmation of the report by the Council,
the delinquent charges contained therein shall constitute a special
assessment against the property at which the services were rendered.
Thereafter, such assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the
same penalties and same procedure of sale as provided for delinquent ordinary
property taxes.



         (b)   The assessments shall be subordinate to all
existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the property, and
paramount to all other liens except those for state, county and municipal
taxes with which it shall be upon parity.  The lien shall continue until the
assessment and all interest and penalties due and payable thereon are paid. 
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of property taxes
shall be applicable to the special assessments.



      8.   Report transmitted to auditor: A certified copy of the
confirmed report shall be filed annually with the county auditor on or before
August 15th. The descriptions of the parcels subject to the special
assessment shall be those used for the same parcels on the county assessor's
map books for the current years.

   A.   The city users of the water system and property owners have
borne the costs for the existing water system in the city which includes
tanks, wells, pump houses, pumps and mains and other related maintenance
materials and equipment. New connections by owners of property or proposed
users of the water system will involve use of the capacity of these existing
water facilities which were paid for, or have been constructed for, and are
owned by the city.



   B.   Therefore, a water system capacity fee must be paid to the city
for any connection to the city water system, which will result in an increase
in water volume or flows.  The amount of the water system capacity fee shall
be as specified in Section 13.12.055.  These fees shall also be reflected in
the Master Fee Schedule separately adopted by resolution of the city council.



   C.   The fees collected are to be placed in a fund to be used for
capital improvements to the water system.  The current fund and account to
which this fee will be applied is 640-3641.  The fund balance of this fund
will be reserved for capital improvement projects.



   D.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the capacity fee will be evaluated annually.  Any cumulative increase in the
Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI) from the CCI used
for the existing fee amount resulting in a rate change of at least $25 shall
be presented to the city council in a public hearing by the first regular
council meeting in March of each year for review and possible adjustment by
ordinance.  Any adjustment shall be further reflected in the Master Fee
Schedule as adopted by resolution of the city council effective April 1 of
that year.  The minimum fee change shall be $25 reflecting the cumulative
CCI change from the CCI used for the currently published fee.



   E.   The CCI (or its successor) published in January for December of

property owners to be served.



   B.   A water distribution fee must be paid to the city by persons
desiring to connect directly to existing water mains, which were installed
without direct or indirect cost to the connecting property.  The water
distribution fee shall be as specified in Section 13.12.055.  These fees
shall also be reflected in the Master Fee Schedule separately adopted by
resolution of the city council.



   C.   Persons installing distribution water main infrastructure in
order to connect to existing distribution water mains or having such
infrastructure installed by the city or by city contract shall pay the full
cost of such installation.  If the property developer does installation, the
installation shall be in lieu of payment of the then current water
distribution fee.  If installation is done by the city or by city contract,
the property developer shall reimburse the city for costs incurred for such
installation, in lieu of payment of the then current water distribution fee.



   D.   The water distribution fees are to be placed in the water
operating fund to offset expenses incurred in water line construction or
extension costs.  The current fund and account to which this fee will be
applied is 630-3641.



   E.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the capacity fee will be evaluated annually.  Any cumulative increase in the
Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI) from the CCI used
for the existing fee amount resulting in a rate change of at least $25 shall
be presented to the city council in a public hearing by the first regular

water service which extends from the distribution system to a water meter at
the property or easement line. Initial construction costs of the water
service and meter installation must be borne by the property to be served.



   B.   A water distribution fee must be paid to the city by persons
desiring to connect directly to existing water mains, which were installed
without direct or indirect cost to the connecting property.  The water
distribution fee shall be as specified in Section 13.12.055.  These fees
shall also be reflected in the Master Fee Schedule separately adopted by
resolution of the city council.



   C.   Persons installing distribution water main infrastructure in
order to connect to existing distribution water mains or having such
infrastructure installed by the city or by city contract shall pay the full
cost of such installation.  If the property developer does installation, the
installation shall be in lieu of payment of the then current water
distribution fee.  If installation is done by the city or by city contract,
the property developer shall reimburse the city for costs incurred for such
installation, in lieu of payment of the then current water distribution fee.

13.12.057  Collection of water service charges.



   Property owners liable for water service payments and connection
charges to their properties:



   A.   The property owner, as determined by the real property tax roll
of the Butte County Assessor, is liable for payment of water meter use and
connection charges, where connections currently exist or where new
connections are made, for services by connection with the city water system.
The charges shall be in such amount and manner as shall be established and
fixed from time to time by resolution of the City Council and shall be for
services furnished to the property by the city.



   B.   The liability of the property owner for these charges exists
even if the user of the sewer service is not the owner of the property. An
occupant other than the owner may pay the charges on the behalf of the owner.



   C.   It is the responsibility of the owner of the real property to
provide the city Finance Director with the current billing address and to
notify the city Finance Director of any changes of address.



   D.   The fees for water meter, services and connection charges
established by this section shall be payable to the city.



   E.   It shall be the duty of the city Finance Department to collect
all charges provided for in this chapter.



   F.   The provisions of this section shall not apply to water service
charges incurred at residential property when the owner of such property has
not applied for or contractually agreed to pay for water service charges
supplied to such property. 



(Ord. 785-2009, § 5, 2009)



13.12.060  Cost for additional facilities.



   A.   The person or property to be served shall pay all costs of
construction of all water delivery facilities,, including, but not limited
to, off-site water main to the corner of the property, construction of a
well, fire hydrants, tanks, pumps, or other unusual water facilities if
required to provide water service to that property.



   B.   However, if more than 100 feet of off-site water main is
required to reach the corner of the property or construction of a well, fire
hydrants, tanks, pumps, or other unusual water facilities are required, and
if these facilities will potentially serve other properties, the city may
enter into a reimbursement agreement for a reimbursement of a portion of
these costs.



   C.   The reimbursement amount will be based upon 40% of the capacity
and distribution fees received by the city from the properties served by the
facilities included in the reimbursement agreement. Payment will be based
upon 40% of the fees received by the city within each fiscal year thereafter.



   D.   The amount reimbursed by the city shall not exceed the amount
specified in the reimbursement agreement. The agreement shall be for a period
not to exceed 10 years. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.12.070  Special agreement required outside city.



   No parcel of land situated outside of the city shall in any manner be
or have any structure thereon connected to the water system of the city
except by special agreement with the city council. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.12.080  Violation-Penalty.



   A.   The wilful misrepresentation of any material fact with
knowledge of its falsity or without reasonable cause to believe it to be
true, to any city officer or the city council with the intent thereby to
influence official action herein, shall be a violation of this chapter.



   B.   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provisions of
this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof
shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500, or by imprisonment not
exceeding six months or by both such fine and imprisonment. The person, firm
or corporation shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and
every day during any portion of which any violation of this chapter is
committed, continued or permitted by such person, firm or corporation and
shall be punishable as provided in this chapter. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.12.090  Charges constituting a lien/procedures to lien.



   A.   The water meter, service or connection charges imposed pursuant
to these regulations constitute a lien upon the parcel of real property to
which such service was rendered.



   B.   Lien recorded-Procedure.



      1.   Notwithstanding any provision in this code to the
contrary, any water service charges which have become delinquent shall cause
the owner of such property to be subject to a lien on the property pursuant
to the procedure provided in this section. Any such lien shall be recorded
with the county recorder.



      2.   Prior to the recordation of a lien for delinquent
charges, the Finance Director shall cause the notice of an opportunity for
hearing on the delinquent charges to be mailed to the owner. For purposes of
this section, the term "owner" shall have the meaning given it in these
regulations. If the owner desires a hearing thereon, he shall request such a
hearing by notifying the City Clerk thereof in writing within ten days after
the date shown on the notice. Any such hearing shall be set not earlier than
ten days after receipt of the owner's request. The hearing shall be held
before the City Council. The decision of the City Council shall be final and
conclusive.



      3.   At the expiration of the time within which to request a
hearing, or upon a decision adverse to the owner after hearing, the City
Council shall cause such lien to be recorded with the county recorder in the
form and manner prescribed by law. Thereafter, such lien shall not be
released by the Finance Director unless and until it is fully and completely
paid or an acceptable arrangement with the city has been agreed to by the
city.



      4.   The Finance Director is authorized to determine the
administrative costs of the delinquency, including costs associated with
processing the delinquent account, which will be subject to an individual
lien pursuant to the recording procedures of this section. Delinquent charges
will be collected as a special assessment. Not less often than once a year,
the Finance Director may initiate proceedings to make delinquent water
service charges a special assessment against the parcels of property to which
such service was rendered.



      5.   The Finance Director shall transmit through the City
Administrator to Council, a report of delinquent charges.



      6.   Hearing: Upon receipt of the report, the City
Administrator shall fix a time, date and place for the City Council to hear
the report, and any protests or objections thereto. At the time fixed for
consideration of the report, the Council shall hear it with any objections of
the property owners liable to be assessed for delinquent accounts. The
Council may make such revisions, corrections, or modifications to the report
as it may deem just, and in the event the Council is satisfied with the
correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or
modified), it shall be confirmed or rejected by resolution. The decision of
the City Council on the report and on all protests or objections thereto
shall be final and conclusive.



      7.   Method of collection; applicability of other liens, laws,
etc.



         (a)   Upon confirmation of the report by the Council,
the delinquent charges contained therein shall constitute a special
assessment against the property at which the services were rendered.
Thereafter, such assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as ordinary property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the
same penalties and same procedure of sale as provided for delinquent ordinary
property taxes.



         (b)   The assessments shall be subordinate to all
existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the property, and
paramount to all other liens except those for state, county and municipal
taxes with which it shall be upon parity. The lien shall continue until the
assessment and all interest and penalties due and payable thereon are paid.
All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of property taxes
shall be applicable to the special assessments.



      8.   Report transmitted to auditor: A certified copy of the
confirmed report shall be filed annually with the county auditor on or before
August 15th. The descriptions of the parcels subject to the special
assessment shall be those used for the same parcels on the county assessor's
map books for the current years.

A record of the test results will be maintained by the city and the results
summarized and reported annually.  Charges for the service shall be in
accordance with the current rate schedule as specified in Section
13.13.045.  These fees shall also be reflected in the Master Fee Schedule
separately adopted by resolution of the city council.



   D.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the water system protection fees will be evaluated annually.  Any cumulative
increase in the Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI)
from the CCI used for the existing fee amount resulting in a rate change of
at least $25 shall be presented to the city council in a public hearing by
the first regular council meeting in March of each year for review and
possible adjustment by ordinance.  Any adjustment shall be further reflected
in the Master Fee Schedule as adopted by resolution of the city council
effective April 1 of that year.  The minimum fee change shall be $25
reflecting the cumulative CCI change from the CCI used for the currently
published fee.



   E.   The CCI (or its successor) published in January for December of
the previous year shall be the index used for determining any rate change.
The initial CCI for the purposes of this fee is 6825 as published in the
January 2004 Engineering News Record.

   C.   Landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California
by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to
the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire
protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development.



   D.   Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and
maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California's
environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability
goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face
of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of
the chapter, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:



      1.   Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by
reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water
retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon
storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits.



      2.   Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water
requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and
pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.



      3.   Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and
graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that
need minimal supplemental water after establishment.



      4.   Protecting air and water quality by reducing power
equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally
sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation
equipment to prevent erosion.



      5.   Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by
choosing local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding
invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic
methods as the first course of action.



   E.   This policy protects local water supplies through the
implementation of a whole systems approach to design, construction,
installation and maintenance of the landscape resulting in water conserving
climate-appropriate landscapes, improved water quality and the minimization
of natural resource inputs.

      4.   A minimum three inch (3") layer of mulch shall be applied
on all exposed soil surfaces of planting areas except in turf areas, creeping
or rooting groundcovers, or direct seeding applications where mulch is
contraindicated. To provide habitat for beneficial insects and other
wildlife, up to five percent (5%) of the landscape area may be left without
mulch. Designated insect habitat must be included in the landscape design
plan as such.



      5.   Stabilizing mulching products shall be used on slopes
that meet current engineering standards.

applicant inquire about peak water operating demands (on the water supply
system) or water restrictions that may impact the effectiveness of the
irrigation system.



            (14)   In mulched planting areas, the use of low
volume irrigation is required to maximize water infiltration into the root
zone.



            (15)   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices
shall have matched precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the
manufacturer's recommendations.



            (16)   Head to head coverage is recommended.
However, sprinkler spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible
distribution uniformity using the manufacturer's recommendations.

that produces no runoff or overspray.



            (20)   Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted
within twenty-four (24) inches of any non-permeable surface. Allowable
irrigation within the setback from non-permeable surfaces may include drip,
drip line, or other low flow non-spray technology. The setback area may be
planted or unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or
other porous material. These restrictions may be modified if:



               a.   The landscape area is adjacent to
permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; or



               b.   The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are
designed and constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or



               c.   The irrigation designer specifies an
alternative design or technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation
Package and clearly demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design
criteria. Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during the
irrigation audit.



            (21)   Slopes greater than twenty-five percent
(25%) shall not be irrigated with an irrigation system with an application
rate exceeding 0.75 inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the
landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of
the Landscape Documentation Package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or

   A.   The city users of the municipal electrical system have borne
the costs for the existing electrical system in the city, which includes the
substation from which municipal power is distributed, and all of the
electrical equipment required to keep the system in operation. New
connections by owners of property of proposed users of the municipal
electrical system will use a portion of the capacity of these existing
facilities, which facilities were paid for, or have been constructed by and
are owned by the city. Therefore, an electrical capacity fee must be paid to
the city for any new connection to the municipal electrical system, or an
upgrade of an existing connection that provides the ability to utilize more
power.



   B.   The electrical capacity fee will be a one-time charge collected
with the building permit that involves the new connection.  The amount of
the electrical system capacity fee shall be adopted by resolution of the City
Council.



   C.   The fees collected are to be placed in a fund to be used for
capital improvements to the electrical system.  The current fund and account
to which this fee will be applied is 620-3641.  The fund balance of this
fund will be reserved for capital improvement projects.



   D.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the capacity fee will be evaluated annually.  Any cumulative increase in the
Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI) resulting in a rate
change of at least $25 shall be reflected in the master fee schedule as
adopted by resolution of the city council effective April 1 of that year. 
The fee shall be changed in $25 increments reflecting the cumulative CCI
change from the most recently published rate.



   E.   The CCI (or its successor) published in January for December of
the previous year shall be the index used for determining any rate change. 
The initial CCI for the purposes of this fee is 6825 as published in the
January 2004 Engineering News Record.

   A.   Each property which is proposed to be connected to the
municipal electrical system will be served by existing electrical
distribution lines that were paid for by existing city users of the system.
An electrical distribution fee must be paid to the city by persons desiring
to connect directly to an existing electrical distribution line which was
installed without direct or indirect cost to the connecting property.



   B.   The electrical distribution fee will be a one-time charge
collected with the building permit that involves the new connection. The
amount of the electrical system distribution fee shall be adopted by
resolution of the City Council.



   C.   Persons installing electrical distribution infrastructure in
order to connect to existing electrical distribution system or having such
infrastructure installed by the city or by city contract shall pay the full
cost of the installation.  If the property developer does installation, such
installation shall be in lieu of payment of the then current electrical
distribution fee.  If installation is done by the city or by city contract,
the property developer shall reimburse the city for costs incurred for such
installation, in lieu of payment of the then current electrical distribution
fee.



   D.   The fees collected are to be placed in a fund to be used for
capital improvements to the electrical system.  The current fund and account
to which this fee will be applied is 620-3641.  The fund balance of this
fund will be reserved for capital improvement projects.



   E.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the distribution fee will be evaluated annually.  Any cumulative increase in
the Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI) resulting in a
rate change of at least $25 shall be reflected in the master fee schedule as
adopted by resolution of the city council  effective April 1 of that year. 
The fee shall be changed in $25 increments reflecting the cumulative CCI
change from the most recently published rate.

   A.   Every property which is provided with a new municipal electric
connection will be served by an electric service device that must be
installed by the city. An electrical service connection fee must be paid to
the city to cover the costs of installing the electrical service line from
the distribution system to the property, as well as the cost of the meter.



   B.   The electrical service connection fee will be a one-time charge
collected with the building permit that involves the new connection. The
amount of the electrical service connection fee will be established by
resolution of City Council.



   C.   An electric service connection (meter) fee must be paid to the
city if the property developer performs the work.  In this case the meter
fee shall cover the cost of installing the meter.  Installation of the
service connection line, meter box and other apertures shall be in accordance
with the then current City’s Public Works Construction Standards.  The
portion of the meter fee pertaining to installing the service line from the
distribution system to the meter box shall be determined by the City Engineer
and deducted from the then published meter fee amount.  Alternatively, the
City Engineer shall determine the cost of the meter and standard apertures
and installation thereof and charge that amount as the meter fee.



   D.   The funds are to be deposited into the electric operating fund
to defray electrical service and meter costs.  The current fund and account
to which this fee will be applied is 600-3641.



   E.   After the initial rate modification, effective June 1, 2004,
the distribution fee will be evaluated annually. Any cumulative increase in
the Engineering News Record’s Construction Cost Index (CCI) resulting in a
rate change of at least $25 shall be reflected in the master fee schedule as
adopted by resolution of the City Council effective April 1 of that year. 
The fee shall be changed in $25 increments reflecting the cumulative CCI
change from the most recently published rate.

required by the city, the estimated cost of installation and removal of the
temporary service, less the estimated salvage of the facilities necessary for
furnishing the temporary service.



      2.   The applicant shall pay an energy charge equal to 130% of
the rate applicable to the highest tier of the regular residential power
sales rate structure.  This charge shall be effective until the applicable
project is completed (if no building permit is involved) or a Certificate of
Completion is issued (if a building permit is required).  The rate and terms
and conditions of providing power under this section and item shall be
reflected in an individual agreement for temporary electrical power for
construction entered into by the city and applicant.



   B.   Change to permanent status.



      1.   If the electrical machinery or apparatus originally
installed, or its equivalent, is operated for a period of twelve consecutive
months from the date service is first delivered under this rule, and if the
customer has proved its permanency to the satisfaction of the city, the
payment made by the applicant pursuant to Section A hereof may be adjusted to
the basis of the city's rules for permanent service in effect at the time of
adjustment, provided, the customer then complies with all the rules
applicable to permanent electric service.

   A.   A system extension or reinforcement required by a subdivision
or other development outside the present electric service area will be
considered economically justified if the city's expense and investment in the
construction is not greater than 2.0 times the expected gross annual revenue
from the subdivision or other development.



   B.   If the City Engineer determines that the requested extension is
not justified economically, the applicant shall pay as a connection charge,
in addition to all other applicable charges, the amount required to reduce
the city's investment in the construction of 2.0 times the expected annual
gross revenue.



   C.   The City Engineer's decision, after consideration of all
available facts, will be final.

13.16.060  Notice to property owners and utility companies.



   A.   Within ten days after the effective date of a resolution
adopted pursuant to Section 13.16.030 A, the city clerk shall notify all
affected utilities and all persons owning real property within the district
created by the resolution of the adoption thereof. The city clerk shall
further notify such affected property owners of the necessity that, if they
or any person occupying such property desire to continue to receive electric,
communication, or similar associated service, they or such occupant shall
provide all necessary facility changes on their premises to receive such
service from the lines of the supplying utility or utilities at a new
location.



   B.   Notification by the city clerk shall be made by mailing a copy
of the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 13.16.030 A, together with a
copy of the ordinance codified in this chapter, to affected property owners
as such are shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the affected
utilities. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.16.070  Responsibility of utility companies.



   If underground construction is necessary to provide utility service
within a district created by any resolution adopted pursuant to Section
13.16.030 A, the supplying utility shall furnish that portion of the
conduits, conductors and associated equipment required to be furnished by it
under its applicable rules, regulations and tariffs on file with the
commission. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.16.080  Responsibility of city.



   The city shall remove at its own expense all city-owned equipment from
all poles required to be removed hereunder in ample time to enable the owner
or user of such poles to remove the same within the time specified in the
resolution enacted pursuant to Section 13.16.030 A. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.16.090  Responsibility of property owners.



   A.   Every person owning, operating, leasing, occupying, or renting
a building or structure within a district shall construct and provide that
portion of the service connection on his property between the facilities
referred to in Section 13.16.070 and the termination facility on or within
the building or structure being served. If the above is not accomplished by
any person within the time provided for in the resolution enacted pursuant to
Section 13.16.030 A, the city administrator shall give notice in writing to
the person in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing to the
owner thereof as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, to provide the
required underground facilities within ten days after receipt of such notice.



   B.   The notice to provide the required underground facilities may
be given either by personal service or by mail. In case of service by mail on
either of such persons, the notice must be deposited in the United States
mail in a sealed envelope with postage prepaid, addressed to the person in
possession of such premises at such premises, and the notice must be
addressed to the owner thereof as such owner's name appears, and to such
owner's last known address as the same appears on the last equalized
assessment roll, and when no address appears, to General Delivery, City of
Gridley. If notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed to have been
received by the person to whom it has been sent within forty-eight hours
after the mailing thereof. If notice is given by mail to either the owner or
occupant of such premises, the city administrator shall, within forty-eight
hours after the mailing thereof, cause a copy thereof, printed on a card not
less than eight inches by ten inches in size, to be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises.



   C.   The notice given by the city administrator to provide the
required underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is
required to be done, and shall state that if the work is not completed within
thirty days after receipt of such notice, the city administrator will provide
such required underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense
thereof will be assessed against the property benefitted and become a lien
upon such property.



   D.   If upon the expiration of the thirty-day period, the required
underground facilities have not been provided, the city administrator shall
forthwith proceed to have the work done; provided, however, if such premises
are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished
thereto, the city administrator shall in lieu of providing the required
underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and
removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities
supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the work, the
city administrator shall file a written report with the city council setting
forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided
and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the property
against which such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a
time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of the cost of
such work upon such premises, which time shall not be less than ten days
thereafter.



   E.   The city administrator shall forthwith, upon the time for
hearing such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the
person in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing thereof to the
owner thereof, in the manner provided for in this chapter, the giving of the
notice to provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place
that the council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against
such assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed
assessment.



   F.   Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the
council shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any,
and then proceed to affirm, modify, or reject the assessment.



   G.   If any assessment is not paid within five days after its
confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien
upon the property against which the assessment is made by the city
administrator, and the city administrator is directed to turn over to the
assessor and tax collector a notice of lien on each of the properties on
which the assessment has not been paid, and the assessor and tax collector
shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes
levied against the premises upon which assessment was not paid. The
assessment shall be due and payable at the same time as the property taxes
are due and payable, and if not paid when due and payable, shall bear
interest at the rate of six percent per year.



   H.   The provisions of Government Code Section 38793 are
incorporated into this section for the purpose of assessing and collecting
the costs involved. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.16.100  Unlawful acts.



   Whenever the council creates an underground utility district and orders
the removal of poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures
therein as provided in Section 13.16.030 A, it shall be unlawful for any
person or utility to erect, construct, place, keep, maintain, continue,
employ or operate poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures in
the district after the date when the overhead facilities are required to be
removed by such resolution, except as the overhead facilities may be required
to furnish service to an owner or occupant of property prior to the
performance by such owner or occupant of the underground work necessary for
such owner or occupant to continue to receive utility service as provided in
Section 13.16.090, and for such reasonable time required to remove the
facilities after the work has been performed, and except as otherwise
provided in this chapter.

(Ord 694,2000)



13.20.020  Permit or improvement plans--investigations.



   A.   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or improvement
plans prepared by a registered civil engineer, including such additional
information as may be required, the city engineer shall, within thirty days,
make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine whether or not
the proposed work or activity will impede, restrict, retard, or change the
direction of the flow of water; or will catch or collect debris carried by
such water; or will be located where the natural flow of the stormwater and
flood water will carry away or damage any intended structure, or any part
thereof; or will in his opinion damage, weaken, erode, or reduce the
effectiveness of the banks to withhold stormwater and flood water; or will
interfere with drainage facilities; or will impose any liability upon the
city for such works, or any damage caused thereby. To make the investigation
he may return the application or improvement plans to the applicant for
additional information, structural analysis or soil test, as may be required
to complete his investigation. In the event the application is returned, the
thirty-day period shall not commence to run until the date of resubmission of
the application.



   B.   Where the application for a permit is for the purpose of
constructing a building or other structure, the city engineer shall, within
thirty days, make such investigations as he deems necessary to determine
whether the proposed work or activity will be subject to inundation, or will
be damaged by such inundation, and whether the development complies with the
Gridley Public Works Construction Standards. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).

approve, or disapprove the application for a permit or improvement plans on
the basis of his investigations. Where application is made to obtain a permit
to construct any building, structure or other improvement, or to place any
trailer, mobile home, or similar vehicle on land subject to flooding, the
city engineer may require as a condition to the granting of the permit the
construction of the building pad or floor levels at an elevation, as
determined by the city engineer, which will protect the structure from
frequent flooding.  The city engineer may also require any other conditions
to the granting of the permit that are reasonably calculated to protect the
property from damage, or to prevent impeding, restricting, or retarding, or
changing the direction of the flow of water in the waterway. The city
engineer may also require as a condition to the granting of the permit that
the owner of the property enter into a written agreement with the city
holding this agency free from liability for any harm that may occur to any
building or property damaged by flooding. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.20.040  Granting of permit.



   A.   The city engineer shall not grant a permit if the permit will
authorize work or activity which is inconsistent with the general plan of the
county or a specific drainage plan which has been adopted by the county or
the city.



   B.   If a permit is granted, it shall state the conditions upon
which it is granted. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.20.050  Appeal procedure.



   A.   In the event that an applicant is aggrieved by the decision of
the city engineer in. the. computation of a drainage fee, or by the
disapproval of a permit, or by the conditions imposed for approval of a
permit required by this chapter, or by reason of the application,
administration, or other requirements of this chapter, the applicant may,
within fifteen days from the date of the decision of the city engineer or
imposition of the drainage fee, appeal in writing to the city council. The
clerk of the city council shall set a time for the hearing of such appeal,
which hearing shall be held within thirty days from the date of receipt of
the appeal, and shall mail or deliver notification to the appellant and the
city engineer of the date at least two weeks prior to the date so set.



   B.   When the appeal is based upon the disapproval of a permit or
the conditions imposed for approval of the application for a permit required
by this chapter, it shall be incumbent upon the appellant to show to the
satisfaction of the city council that denial of the permit or conditions
attached thereto will cause undue hardship on the applicant, and will prevent
him from making a reasonable use of the property; and that such structure so
proposed will not impede, restrict, retard, or change the direction of the
flow of water in the waterway; or will not catch debris carried by such
water; or is not placed where the natural flow of the stormwater and flood
water will carry away or damage the structure, or any part thereof; or will
not damage, weaken, erode, or reduce the effectiveness of the banks to
withhold stormwater and flood water; or will not interfere with facilities
necessary for flood control and drainage; nor will it impose upon the city
any liability therefor.



   C.   If the permit was denied by the city engineer because the work
or activity, if completed, would prove. inconsistent with the general plan of
the county or a specified drainage plan adopted by the city or the county,
the permit shall not be granted on appeal unless the appellant, in addition
to any other requirements of this section, shall prove to the city council
that the work or activity proposed is not inconsistent with either the
general plan of the county or a specific drainage plan.



   D.   The decision of the city council shall be final. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.20.060  Fee schedule.



   There is established the following schedule of fees to be collected
upon the construction of new buildings and improvements within the city. Such
fees shall be used for construction of trunk and collector drainage
facilities as defined in this chapter.



   A.   Whenever a change in the use of parcel of land occurs, which
would require a drainage fee greater than the fee which was required for the
prior use, the fee shall be computed at the rate required in this chapter for
the new use less the amount of any drainage fees which have been previously
paid for the parcel of land. In the event such fee previously paid exceeds
the fee required for the proposed use, no refund of the difference shall be
made.



   B.   Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the fees required by
this section will be due and payable at such time as a building permit is
issued, or improvement plans for the construction of street or subdivision
improvements are approved by the department of public works, or improvements
are constructed which, as determined by the city engineer, impair the
perviousness of the surface of land; except, however, when frontage
improvements are placed at the option of the owner and not as a requirement
of the department of public works, the city engineer may defer such fees
until a building permit is issued or such improvements impairing the
perviousness of the surface are constructed.



   C.   For the purposes of this section, the "gross area of the site"
is defined as that area of the site including the area to the centerline of
all abutting streets. Easements for underground facilities, setback areas and
other areas not denying the owner's use thereof shall be included in the
gross area.



   D.   The city finance officer shall keep accurate records concerning
the collection of fees under this chapter. Such records shall set forth the
amount of fees paid as to each parcel of land or improvement to which the
fees apply.



   E.   All fees and credits as defined in this chapter shall be
rounded to the nearest dollar. 



(Ord. 539 (part), 1988).



13.20.070  Special fee provision.



   The following special provisions shall be applicable to the fees
authorized by Section 13.20.060:



   A.   Whenever trunk and collector drainage. facilities are
constructed pursuant to plans approved by the city engineer, and the cost
thereof exceeds the amount of the fee, no reimbursement shall be made for the
amount in excess of the required fee.



   B.   If any fees collected are in excess of the cost of the
particular project, the fees, nevertheless, shall be held in trust for the
solution of future drainage problems, unless reimbursement is agreed to by
the city council.



   C.   School districts may pay any required fees in five equal annual
payments, upon the following terms and conditions:



      1.   First payment. is paid at the time the building permit is
issued or site improvement plans are approved.



      2.   No new trunk facilities are required to immediately serve
the property.



      3.   A written agreement is executed between the school
district and the city under which payment may be deferred as provided in this
chapter.



   D.   The city engineer may waive any fees due and payable where a
building permit is being issued for a building to replace one destroyed by
fire or other disaster; provided, however, this subsection shall not operate
to waive any fees due and payable by reason of change in land use or zoning.



   E.   In those circumstances where a use permit is issued for a
mobile home or travel trailer either as an accessory dwelling where there is
need of close supervision of a relative who is handicapped, or for temporary
uses, the city engineer may waive any fees otherwise due under this chapter
as a result of the installation of the mobile home or travel trailer.



   F.   On or before March 1st of each year the city staff shall
determine new drainage fees according to the following:



      1.   On January 1st of each year, the city staff shall review
the National Engineering News Record construction cost index (ENRCCI). When
that index differs from 4456.53, a factor shall be applied to all drainage
fees. The factor shall be computed by dividing the ENRCCI for that particular
January 1st, by 4456.53.



      2.   The following drainage fees shall be multiplied by the
factor to determine the new drainage fees. The new schedules shall be rounded
to the nearest ten dollars. Such adjusted fees shall be published and shall
become effective March 1st of each year. Copies of the revised schedules
shall be available in the office of the public works department.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES



Chapter 14.04   Impact Fees for Public Facilities and Services.



Chapter 14.04 Impact Fees for Public Facilities and Services



   14.04.010   Purpose and Authority.



   14.04.020   No Mandatory Duty of Care.



   14.04.030   Establishing Development Impact Fees.



   14.04.040   Collection of Development Impact Fees.



14.04.010 Purpose and authority.



   The purpose of this chapter is relating to development impact fees for
public facilities and services within the city to make them applicable in all
parts of the city. The City Council enacts this chapter pursuant to the
authority granted cities by Article XI, Section 7 of the California
Constitution. 



(Ord. 744 (part), 2005)



14.04.020 No mandatory duty of care.



   This chapter is not intended to and shall not be construed or given
effect in a manner that imposes upon the city or any officer or employee
thereof a mandatory duty of care towards persons and property within or
without the city, so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages,
except as otherwise imposed by law. 



(Ord. 744 (part), 2005)



14.04.030 Establishing development impact fees.



   A.   That new development in the city shall be required to pay their
fair share of capital improvements needed as a result of the projected
growth. Further, that the capital improvement cost for new growth is
determined in the city Development Impact Fee Study.



   B.   That the city finds that it is necessary that its development
impact fee for capital improvements go into effect immediately in order that
all properties in the city pay their fair share of the cost associated with
the improvements. Immediate implementation of these fees is necessary due to
the current and immediate threat to public safety which will result should
there be a shortfall in the amount of money necessary to pay for the various
improvements therefore resulting in failure to the existing infrastructure.
The city finds that the prospect fo a revenue shortfall and failure of
infrastructure continues a current, immediate threat to the public health,
welfare and safety, which justifies the immediate imposition of these fees.



   C.   That the 20-city Construction Cost Index published by the
Engineering News Record shall adjust the Development Impact Fees Schedule
annually, on or before April 1, each year.



   D.   That the amount of the Development Impact Fees shall be
collected at issuance of the building permit and shall apply to all new
construction within the city.



   E.   The city shall calculate the equivalent fee amount for non-
residential uses, based on the single family residential rate prior to
issuance of a building permit.



   F.   The development impact fees shall be as indicated in Exhibit A
of Ordinance 747-2005 as adopted by reference and may be amended as
appropriate by resolution.



   G.   This chapter shall be of no further force and effect 30 days
after its adoption unless extended by the city.



   H.   This chapter does not supersede the interim emergency Ordinance
745-2005, enacted by the city on March 25, 2005, placing a  moratorium on
issuance of building permits, however any person who effectively waives any
objection to the city’s authority to impose the fees established by this
chapter (the form of waiver to be satisfactory to the City Attorney) and who
also pays such fees, may obtain issuance of building permits at the time the
fees are paid. The agreement waiving objections to the fees may provide that
occupancy permits may be withheld until such time as sufficient capacity
improvements exist to avoid endangering the public health, welfare and safety
of the community. 



(Ord. 749, 2005; Ord. 747, 2005)



14.04.040  Collection of development impact fees.



   A change in use of a parcel of property shall constitute new
development for purposes of requiring the payment of development impact
fees.  Such fees shall be calculated based upon the new use of the property
and shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit (to include a
building permit for any existing structures on the property).

15.08.010  Statutory authorization.



   The legislature of the State of California has in Government Code
Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units
authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare of its citizenry.  Therefore, the City Council of the
City of Gridley does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations. (Ord. 794, 2010).



15.08.020  Findings of fact.



   A.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Gridley are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.



   B.   These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage.  The cumulative
effect of obstructions in the areas of special flood hazards which increase
flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. (Ord. 794,
2010).



15.08.030  Statement of purpose.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied
uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land
within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood related erosion areas. 
These regulations are designed to:



   A.   Protect human life and health;



   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;



   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;



   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
blighted areas caused by flood damage;



   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in
an area of special flood hazard; and



   H.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 794, 2010).



15.08.040  Methods of reducing flood losses.



   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations
to:



   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;



   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;



   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;



   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and



   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. (Ord. 794, 2010)



15.08.050  Definitions.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in

by a cone or fan shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that
have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then
deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high
velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and
channel migration.



   E.   “Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform

on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  The base flood depths range from
one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of
flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be
evident.  Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   H.   “Area of special flood hazard.”  See “Special flood
hazard area.”



   I.   “Base flood” means a flood which has a one percent chance
of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the “100 year
flood”).  Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter.



   J.   “Base flood elevation” (BFE) means the elevation shown on
the Flood Insurance Rate Map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that

   N.   “Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses,
plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or
development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of
a floodplain.



   O.   “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be

concrete pads) is completed before March 3, 1997.



   P.   “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction
of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to
be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).



   Q.   “Flood, flooding, or flood water” means:



   1.   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal
waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and



   2.   The condition resulting from flood related erosion.



   R.   “Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)” means the official
map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance
Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the
floodway.



   S.   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on
which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance
Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the
risk premium zones applicable to the community.



   T.   “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided
by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the
Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water
surface elevation of the base flood.



   U.   “Floodplain or flood prone area” means any land area
susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see “Flooding.”



   V.   “Floodplain Administrator” is the community official
designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management
regulations.



   W.   “Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall
program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and
preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the
floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood
control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.



   X.   “Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and
other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health
regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control)
and other application of police power which control development in flood
prone areas.  This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any
combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood
loss and damage.



   Y.   “Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and
nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce
or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and
sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents.  For guidelines on dry
and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB
7-93.



   Z.   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot.  Also referred to as “Regulatory Floodway.”



   AA.   “Floodway fringe” is that area of the floodplain on either
side of the “Regulatory Floodway” where encroachment may be permitted.



   BB.   “Fraud and victimization” as related to Section 15.08.090
of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or
victimization of the public.  In examining this requirement, the City of
Gridley will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to
government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to
one hundred years.  Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the
base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of
damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as
a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering
that those increased flood damages bring.  In addition, future owners may
purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage,
and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.



   CC.   “Functionally dependent use” means a use which cannot
perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close
proximity to water.  The term includes only docking facilities, port
facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or
passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not
include long term storage or related manufacturing facilities.



   DD.   “Governing body” means the local governing unit, i.e.
county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations
to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry.



   EE.   “Hardship” as related to Section 15.08.090 of this chapter
means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the
requested variance.  The City of Gridley requires that the variance be
exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved.  Mere economic
or financial hardship alone is not exceptional.  Inconvenience, aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval
of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional
hardship.  All of these problems can be resolved through other means without
granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires
the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use
than originally intended.



   FF.   “Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural
elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed
walls of a structure.



   GG.   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:



   1.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;



   2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;



   3.   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of Interior; or



   4.   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.



   HH.   “Levee” means a man made structure, usually an earthen
embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering
practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide
protection from temporary flooding.



   II.   “Levee system” means a flood protection system which
consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure
and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound
engineering practices.



   JJ.   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest
enclosed area, including basement (see “Basement” definition).



   1.   An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest
floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a
building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation
design requirements, including, but not limited to:



   a.   The flood openings standard in Section 15.08.080.A.3.c;



   b.   The anchoring standards in Section 15.08.080.A.1;



   c.   The construction materials and methods standards in Section
15.08.080.A.2; and



   d.   The standards for utilities in Section 15.08.080.B.

15.08.060  General provisions.



   A.   Lands to which this chapter applies.  This chapter shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of City of
Gridley.



   B.   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.  The
areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) in the “Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Butte County,
California and Incorporated Areas” dated January 6, 2011, with accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM’s) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps
(FBFM’s), dated January 6, 2011, and all subsequent amendments and/or
revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability
of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which
allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City of
Gridley by the Floodplain Administrator.  The study, FIRM’s and FBFM’s
are on file at the Department of Public Works located at the City Hall of the
City of Gridley, 685 Kentucky Street, Gridley, California 95948.



   C.   Compliance.  No structure or land shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.  Violation
of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall
constitute a misdemeanor.  Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Gridley
from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.



   D.   Abrogation and greater restrictions.  This chapter is not
intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions.  However, where this chapter and another ordinance,
easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.



   E.   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:



   1.   Considered as minimum requirements;



   2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and



   3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.



   F.   Warning and disclaimer of liability.  The degree of flood
protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger
floods can and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased
by man made or natural causes.  This chapter does not imply that land
outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of City of Gridley, any officer or employee
thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.



   G.   Severability.  This chapter and the various parts thereof are
hereby declared to be severable.  Should any section of this chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any portion thereof
other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord.
794, 2010).



15.08.070  Administration.



   A.   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.  The Planning
Director is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this
chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its
provisions.



   B.   Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include, but not be limited to the following:



   1.   Permit review.  Review all development permits to determine:



   a.   Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied,
including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of
existing structures;



   b.   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;



   c.   The site is reasonably safe from flooding;



   d.   The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying
capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a
floodway has not been designated.  This means that the cumulative effect of
the proposed development when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than 1 foot at any point within the City of Gridley; and



   e.   All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR’s) for flood control
projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits.  Building
Permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision
(CLOMR’s).  Approved CLOMR’s allow construction of the proposed flood
control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of
construction” definition.



   2.   Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage
Procedures.



   a.   Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About
Substantially Damaged Buildings,” develop detailed procedures for
identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and
substantial damage, to include defining “Market Value.”



   b.   Assure procedures are coordinated with other
departments/divisions and implemented by community staff.



   3.   Review, use and development of other base flood data.  When
base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section
15.08.060.B, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from
a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Section
15.08.080.



NOTE:  A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from
the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in
Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base
(100-year) Flood Elevations” dated July 1995.



   4.   Notification of other agencies.



   a.   Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:



   (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of
Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;



   (2)   Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency; and



   (3)   Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.



   b.   Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations:



   (1)   Within 6 months of information becoming available or project
completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit
or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to
FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).



   (2)   All LOMR’s for flood control projects are approved prior to
the issuance of building permits.  Building Permits must not be issued based
on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR’s).  Approved CLOMR’s
allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation
as specified in the “start of construction” definition.



Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical
changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain
management requirements are based on current data.



   c.   Changes in corporate boundaries:  Notify FEMA in writing
whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other
means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the
new corporate limits.



   5.   Documentation of floodplain development.  Obtain and maintain
for public inspection and make available as needed the following:



   a.   Certification required by Section 15.08.080.A.3.a and Section
15.08.080.D (lowest floor elevations);



   b.   Certification required by Section 15.08.080.A.3.b (elevation or

biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.



   6.   Map determination.  Make interpretations where needed, as to
the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard,
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
field conditions.  The person contesting the location of the boundary shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section 15.08.070.D.



   7.   Remedial action.  Take action to remedy violations of this
chapter as specified in Section 15.08.060.C.

   (1)   Lowest floor elevation.



   (2)   Pad elevation.



   (3)   Lowest adjacent grade.



   2.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall
be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.



   a.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.



   b.   All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide
adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.



   D.   Standards for manufactured homes.



   1.   All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved, on sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or
subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an
expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home
has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood, shall:



   a.   Within Zones A1 30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood
elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.



   2.   All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1
30, AH, and AE on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not
subject to the provisions of Section 15.08.080.D.1 will be securely fastened
to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the:



   a.   Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation; or



   b.   Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than 36 inches in height above grade.



Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or
licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to
be properly elevated.  Such certification and verification shall be provided
to the Floodplain Administrator.



   E.   Standards for recreational vehicles.  All recreational
vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either:



   1.   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or



   2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use.  A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or



   3.   Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.08.070.C of this
chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes
in Section 15.08.080.D.1.



   F.   Floodways.  Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:



   1.   Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction,
substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than 1 foot at any point within the City of Gridley.



   2.   Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Gridley
shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered
civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.



   3.   If  Sections 15.08.080.F.1 and 2 are satisfied, all new
construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development
shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of
Section 15.08.080. (Ord. 794, 2010).



15.08.090  Variance procedure.



   A.   Nature of variances.  The issuance of a variance is for
floodplain management purposes only.  Insurance premium rates are determined
by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the
granting of a variance.



The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on
the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature.  A variance may be granted for a
parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying
with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to
the applicant or the surrounding property owners.  The characteristics must
be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels.  The unique
characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its
inhabitants, or the property owners.



It is the duty of the City of Gridley to help protect its citizens from
flooding.  This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of
insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances
from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance
are quite rare.  The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss
and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited.  Therefore,
the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and
contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be
properly granted.  The criteria are designed to screen out those situations
in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.



   B.   Conditions for variances.



   1.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on
a lot of one half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing
that the procedures of Sections 15.08.070 and 15.08.080 of this chapter have
been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.



   2.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
“historic structures” (as defined in Section 15.08.050 of this chapter)
upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.



   3.   Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.



   4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.  “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a
minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter.  For example, in
the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City of
Gridley need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or
even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation
which the City of Gridley believes will both provide relief and preserve the
integrity of the local ordinance.



   5.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:



   a.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and



   b.   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.  It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be
recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Butte County
Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of
title of the affected parcel of land.



   6.   The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all
variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.



   C.   Appeal Board.



   1.   In passing upon requests for variances, the City of Gridley
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:



   a.   Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;



   b.   Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;



   c.   Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner
and future owners of the property;



   d.   Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;



   e.   Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;



   f.   Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;



   g.   Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;



   h.   Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;



   i.   Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;



   j.   Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and



   k.   Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and
bridges.



   2.   Variances shall only be issued upon a:



   a.   Showing of good and sufficient cause;



   b.   Determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional “hardship” to the applicant; and



   c.   Determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see “Public safety and
nuisance”), cause “fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict
with existing local laws or ordinances.



   3.   Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial
improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections
15.08.090.C.1 through 15.08.090.C.4 are satisfied and that the structure or
other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during
the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and
does not create a public nuisance.



   4.   Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.08.090.B.1 and
the purposes of this chapter, the City of Gridley may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. 794, 2010).

   The following regulations shall constitute the grading standards of the
city and shall apply to and govern the forms of any grading work in the city:



   A.   All regulations set forth in Section 3308 and Section 3312
through and including Section 3318 of Appendix Chapter 33 of the California
Building Code, 2001 Edition, as published by the International Conference of
Building Officials and the California Building Standards Commission

   A.   Sediment caused by the grading project shall be retained on the
site to the greatest extent feasible. The maximum permanent rate of sediment
loss after completion of the project should not exceed the natural erosion
rate which occurred prior to the grading project. If, in the opinion of the
building official, excessive erosion occurs from the project, erosion and
sediment control measures shall be immediately implemented to reduce erosion
to allowable levels.



   B.   If required by the building official, sediment basins, sediment
traps, or similar sediment control measures, temporary or permanent, shall be
installed prior to clearing and grading operations. Upon completion of
construction and stabilization of soils, all temporary erosion control
measures shall be removed from the site upon written approval of the building
official.

of the 2001 CBC, are minimum requirements and may be increased by the
building official or by the recommendations of a civil engineer, soils
engineer, or engineering geologist, if necessary for safety and stability, or
to prevent damage to other properties from deposition or erosion, or to
provide access for slope maintenance and drainage. Retaining walls and/or
deep foundations may be used to reduce the required setbacks when approved by
the building official. 



(Ord. 758-2005 (part), 2005)



15.14.050  Control of runoff.

erosion and sediment control devices shall be required for all grading and
filling. Control devices and measures which may be required include, but are
not limited to, the following:



   A.   Energy absorbing devices to reduce the velocity of runoff water;



   B.   Sedimentation controls, such as sediment debris basins and
sediment traps. Trapped sediment shall be removed to an on-site or off-site
location approved by the building official;

such permit to be inspected by the building official on a specific date or at
a particular state of such grading work, the building official shall conduct
such inspection on such date or at such stage and shall either approve the
grading work as complying with the grading standards adopted by Chapter 15.14
of this title and/or the grading permit issued pursuant to Chapter 15.16 of
this title, or shall notify the permit holder or an authorized agent as to

stage of such work, it shall be the responsibility of the permit holder or an
authorized agent to request the building official, either orally or in
writing, to make such inspection no less than 24 hours prior to the time the
inspection is desired, unless the building official waives the time in which
request is to be made for good cause shown. Moreover, when a grading permit
requires grading work to be inspected either on a specific date or at a
particular stage of such work, the grading work shall be suspended and not
resumed until the inspection has been made and the work approved as complying
with the grading standards adopted by Chapter 15.14 of this title and/or the

   When inspections are required prior to or as a condition to the
issuance of a grading permit required by Chapter 15.16 of this title, it
shall be the responsibility of the permit holder or any authorized agent of
the permit holder to provide the building official with a safe and convenient
access to the place or thing to be inspected as well as all facilities and
assistance necessary for the building official to make such inspection.

   15.20.070   Penalties.



15.20.010 General provisions.



   The grading regulations may be enforced by the enforcement actions,
penalties and remedies set forth for in this code. Except as otherwise
specifically set forth in this chapter, all enforcement actions, penalties
and remedies provided in this code shall be deemed cumulative, and the
commencement of any one such enforcement action or imposition of any one such
penalty or remedy as a result of a violation of the grading regulations shall
not preclude commencement of any other enforcement action or imposition of
any other penalty or remedy for the same violation. 



(Ord. 758-2005 (part), 2005)



15.20.020 Order to stop work.



   A.   Issuance of Order. Whenever the building official determines
that grading is being performed in violation of the grading regulations, the
building official may issue a Stop Work Order. The order shall include the
order of the building official to stop grading work; a brief description of
the reasons why such work is being ordered stopped and the action, if any,
which must be taken before the work may be resumed; a statement advising of
the right of a person aggrieved by such order to apply for administrative
review of the order and to appeal the order in a manner provided for by
Chapter 15.10; and a statement advising the person on whom the order is
served that unless authorized by the building official, any further work on
such grading may subject such person to the misdemeanor penalties provided in
Section 15.20.070. The order may include a notice to correct the violation,
issued under Section 15,20.030, or in the case of work done under a grading
permit, an order revoking the permit, issued under Section 15.20.040. The
order shall include a statement that it is a misdemeanor to remove or deface
the copy of the order posted pursuant to this section.



   B.   Service of Order. Upon issuing a Stop Work Order, the building
official shall cause the order to be served on the owner of the property on
which such work is being performed, and on any person known to the building
official to be engaged in the work if such person is someone other than the
owner of the property on or within which the work is being performed.



   C.   Posting of Order. Immediately after issuing a Stop Work Order,
the building official shall also cause a copy of the order to be posted in a
conspicuous place on the property on which the grading work is being
performed.



   D.    Effect of Order. No grading work shall be done or caused to be
done on any property for which a Stop Work Order has been issued while the
order is in effect. No person served with a Stop Work Order shall thereafter
cause or permit any grading described in the order to commence, continue, or
resume, unless and until the order is canceled by the building official or a
grading permit is issued to authorize the work in question. 



(Ord. 758- 2005 (part), 2005)



15.20.030  Notice to correct violation.



   A.   Issuance of Notice. Whenever the building official determines
that grading is being performed or a condition exists in violation of the
grading regulations, the building official may issue a notice to correct the
violation. The notice shall contain the name of the persons or persons to
whom it is directed, a brief description of the nature of the violation and
the action to be taken to correct the violation, a date certain by which the
corrective action must be completed, a statement of the right of the persons
to whom the notice is directed to apply for administrative review of such
determination and to appeal such determination in the manner provided for by
Chapter 15.10, and a statement that failure to correct the violation on or
before the date required by the notice may subject such persons to the
infraction penalties provided in Section 15.20.070 and any other remedies
available to the city against the persons or the property.



   B.   Service of Notice. The building official shall cause the notice
to correct to be served on the owner of the property on which the violation
has occurred and on any other person known to the building official to be
wholly or partially responsible for such violation.



   C.   Effect of Notice. Any person served with a notice to correct
shall cause the violation described in the notice to be corrected on or
before the date required by such notice. A person served with a notice to
correct shall not be subject to any of the infraction penalties provided in
Section 15.20.070 if the violation is corrected on or before the date
required by such notice, unless the violation includes grading without a
permit required by this title or in violation of any condition of approval or
mitigation measure of a subdivision of land, subdivision improvement plan,
permit, or other entitlement approved or issued by the city. 



(Ord. 758-2005 (part), 2005)



15.20.040 Order revoking a permit.



   A.   Issuance of Order. Whenever the building official determines
that a grading permit was issued based on a permit application, grading plans
and specifications, a soils engineering report, an engineering geology report
or other data and information that contain any material misrepresentation of
fact, or that such permit appears to authorize grading that violates the
grading regulations, the building official may order revocation of such
permit. In addition to setting forth the order of the building official
revoking such permit, the order shall contain a brief description of the
reasons why the permit is being revoked and the action, if any, which must be
taken to allow the permit to be reissued; a statement of the right of a
person aggrieved by the order to apply for administrative review of the order
and to appeal the order in the manner provided for by Chapter 15.10; and a
statement that unless and until such permit is reissued, further work on the
grading for which such permit was issued may subject each person causing or
doing the work to the misdemeanor penalties provided in Section 15,20.070.
The order may require that grading work or fencing be done as necessary to
leave the site in a reasonably safe condition as to areas disturbed by the
grading work and any fill material onsite or imported for the work.



   B.   Service of Order. Upon issuing an order revoking a grading
permit, the building official shall cause the order to be served personally
or by mail on the permittee and the owner of the property, if other than the
permittee.



   C.   Effect of Order. When a grading permit has been revoked, no
person shall cause or allow any grading to be commenced, continued or resumed
in reliance on the permit, unless and until the permit has been reissued.
When a grading permit is revoked, the permit shall not be reissued unless an
additional grading plan check fee, or grading permit fee, or both, has been
paid. 



(Ord. 758- 2005 (part), 2005)



15.20.050 Right of entry.



   Whenever necessary to enforce the grading regulations, the building
official may enter upon any property at a reasonable tune to inspect such
property and any grading work performed Or being performed thereon. However,
if such property is occupied, the building official shall first present
proper credentials to the occupant thereof and demand entry, and if such
property is not occupied, the building official shall first make a reasonable
effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the
property and demand entry. Should entry be refused, the building official
shall have recourse to every remedy provided by this code and the laws of the
State of California to secure entry to the property. 



(Ord. 758-2005 (part), 2005)



15.20.060 Violation as public nuisance.

commence a legal action or proceeding to abate such nuisance in any manner
provided by law. 



(Ord. 758-2005 (part), 2005)



15.20.070 Penalties.

Order or the removal or defacement of any such order posted pursuant to this
chapter may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding

16.03.020  Intent.



   The purpose of these regulations is to assist in the systematic

   A.   The General Plan, Title 17, Zoning, and the Department of
Public Works Construction Standards shall guide the use of all land within
the incorporated boundaries of the City. The size and design of lots, the
nature of utilities, the design and improvement of streets, the type of
intensity of land use, and the provisions for any special facilities in any
subdivision shall conform to the land uses shown and the standards that have
been established. Neither the approval nor conditional approval of a
development project shall constitute or waive compliance with any other
applicable provisions of the Gridley Municipal Code (GMC) or other applicable
regulations adopted by the City, nor shall any such approval authorize or be
deemed to authorize a violation or failure to comply with other applicable
provisions of its code or other applicable ordinances or regulations adopted
by the City.

shall be considered in accordance with the General Plan. This Title
establishes procedures for the referral of proposed subdivision data to other
departments, interested boards, bureaus and other governmental agencies and
utility companies, both public and private, so that the extension of
community facilities and utilities may be accomplished in an orderly manner,
and coordinated with the development of the subdivision. To facilitate the
acquisition of land required to implement this policy, the City may require
the subdivider to dedicate, grant easements, or otherwise reserve land for
schools, playgrounds, thoroughfares, utility easements and other public
purposes as specified in accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision
Map Act and this Title.

name or number and place of record, by section, township and range, or other
proper designation.



   B.   The procedure and practice of all survey work done upon any
such subdivision shall conform to the accepted standards of the engineering
profession.



   C.   All monuments shall not be less substantial than a
three-quarter-inch diameter pipe eighteen inches long or a five-eighth-inch
diameter steel reinforcing bar eighteen inches long with a brass tag,
aluminum or plastic cap bearing the registration number of the engineer or
surveyor who set the monument, and shall be subject to inspection and
approval by the City Engineer. "Permanent" monuments shall be set in
concrete. Before street improvements are accepted, all monuments disturbed by
the improvements shall be reset.



   D.   In making the survey for the subdivision, the engineer or
surveyor shall set "permanent" monuments at all angle and curve points on the
exterior boundaries of the subdivision, in all street intersections, at all
angle points of street lines, and at all curved points, both simple and
compound, of street lines. "Permanent" monuments at street intersections and
at angle and curved points of street lines shall set on street centerlines,
unless otherwise directed by the City Engineer; provided, however, that the
"permanent" monuments need not be set at intervals of less than four hundred
feet.



   E.   The "permanent" monument shall be set in the ground upright
with the metal marker centered in the concrete, by excavating a six-inch
minimum diameter hole two feet below the finished grade and pouring the same
full of concrete. When streets are required to be paved, the location of such
monument and access thereto shall be given by a suitable concrete or cast
iron sliding sleeve surmounted by a circular cast iron frame and lid at
street surface. In case the monument is not on a street, the metal marker may
be set flush with the existing ground surface.



   F.   The engineer and surveyor shall set monuments at all lot
corners and at all curve points on lot boundary lines.



   G.   There shall be one or more permanent bench marks for each
subdivision, of a type approved by the City engineer and referred to the City
datum, set at each street intersection in the curb return or other location
approved by the City Engineer. The bench mark shall be a brass disc two
inches ± in diameter set in the concrete curb.

16.18.190  Action on final map by Planning Department.



   A.   Upon acceptance of the final map or parcel map and accompanying
documents as property of the City, fees and materials for filing, the
Planning Department shall cause the same to be examined and if found to be in
substantial conformity with the approved tentative map and all amendments,
conditions, modifications and provisions made or required by the approving
body, and if found to be complete, technically correct, in conformity with
improvement plans and specifications, and in compliance with the requirements
of this Title, planned street lines and other applicable specific plans and
ordinances, shall file said map with the City Clerk. No map shall be
certified until the required improvements have been installed in accordance
with Chapters 16.21 and 16.24. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this section, the on-site improvements for the unimproved parcels shown on a
parcel map may be constructed after the final parcel map is filed for record,
but prior to the issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for the
development of such parcel. In such instance, the final or parcel map shall
contain a statement setting forth all on-site and off-site improvements which
must be constructed prior to further parcel development.



   B.   Should the map or other accompanying documents, fees or
materials be found to be incomplete or incorrect in any respect, the
subdivider shall be advised, in writing, by mail, of the changes or additions
that must be made before the map may be certificated. If the defect is the
result of a technical and inadvertent error, which does not materially affect
the validity of the map, the defect may be waived.



   C.   The planning director need not approve final map or parcel map
which is not substantially similar to the approved tentative map if, in
his/her opinion, circumstances concerning the design and improvement of the
subdivision, as they relate to the public health, safety and welfare, having
materially changed since approval of the tentative map, and such changed
circumstances warrant reconsideration thereof. In such instance, the map
shall be returned to the approving agency for further consideration.



   D.   The final or parcel map shall not be considered filed for
action by the City Clerk until the Planning Department has completed such
action required.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 7 (part), 2017)



16.18.200 Public improvement agreement.



   If, at any time of approval of the final map by the Planning
Department, any public improvements required by the City Engineer pursuant to
the provisions of this title have not been completed and accepted in
accordance with City standards applicable at the time of the approval or
conditional approval of the tentative map, as a condition precedent to the
approval of the final map, the subdivider shall be required to enter into an
agreement with the City upon mutually agreeable terms to thereafter complete
such improvements at the subdivider's expense, within the time specified in
the agreement, which time shall in no event exceed twelve (12) months from
the date thereof. Such agreement shall be secured by improvement security in
the amount and form set forth in this title.

(Ord. 824-2016 § 7 (part), 2017)



16.18.220  Amending maps after recordation.



   After a final map or parcel map is filed in the office of the Butte
County Recorder, such a recorded map may be amended by a Certificate of
Correction or an amending map, at the discretion of the City Council, if the
City Council finds that:



   A.   There are changes in circumstances which make any or all of the
conditions of such map no longer appropriate or necessary; and,



   B.   The modifications do not impose any additional burden on the
present fee owner of the property; and,



   C.   The modifications do not alter any right, title, or interest in
the real property reflected on the recorded map; and,



   D.   The modifications, as modified, conform to the requirements for
such maps imposed by this code and State law.



   The subdivider shall apply for an amendment under this section by
filing an application with the Planning Department setting forth all of the
amendments proposed to be made and addressing specifically all of the
findings set forth above. Upon receipt of an application under this section,
it shall immediately be set for a public hearing at the next council meeting
allowing compliance with the notice provisions of Government Code Section
66451.3. The council may, by resolution, set fees to be charged for this
application pursuant to Government Code Section 66451.2.

(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.050  Street patterns.



   The street pattern in the subdivision shall be in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and the
entire neighborhood or district. The following principles shall be observed:



   A.   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
contiguous and in alignment with existing planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.



   B.   When required by the Department of Public Works, proposed
streets shall be extended to the boundary line of the land to be subdivided.
A "No Access Rights" Certificate shall be shown on the final map where
required by the public works department.



   C.   Where the Public Works Department determines that it is
necessary to give access to or permit a satisfactory subdivision of adjoining
land, streets shall extend to the boundary of the property and the resulting
dead-end streets may be approved with a temporary cul-de-sac in accordance
with the Public Works Construction Standards.



   D.   No cul-de-sac shall exceed five hundred (500) feet in length
from the center of the turnaround to the centerline of the intersecting
street unless approved as a special condition by the Planning Commission.



   E.   Proposed streets shall intersect one another at nearly at right
angles as the conditions and other limiting factors of good design shall
permit.



   F.   The centerlines of all streets wherever practicable shall be
the continuation of the centerlines of existing streets or shall be offset at
least two hundred (200) feet for local streets and three hundred (300) for
all other streets.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.060  Design adjacent to arterials.



   Subdivision design adjacent to major streets or highways shall be as
determined by the Planning Commission.



   A.   Street Design. Street design shall have the purpose of making
adjacent lots, if for residential use, desirable for such use by cushioning
the impact of heavy traffic and of minimizing the interference with traffic
on such arterials.



   B.   Intersecting Streets. The number of intersecting streets along
arterials shall be held to a minimum.



   C.   Bordering Highways. When the rear or side lines of any lots
border a State highway or major street, the subdivider may be required to
execute and deliver to the City an instrument prohibiting the right of
ingress and egress to such lots across the side lines of such highways.



   D.   Service Roads; Off-street Parking. When lots proposed for
commercial or industrial uses front on any major or secondary street or
highway, the subdivider may be required to dedicate and improve a parallel
service road to provide ingress and egress to and from such lots. When any
lots proposed for residential use front on a State highway or a major street,
the subdivider may be required to dedicate and improve a frontage service
road at the front of such lots or to back lots to the highway or major
streets.



   E.   Additional parking areas. In addition to the requirements for a
service road, the Planning Commission requires adequate off-street parking
areas for all lots pursuant to Title 17.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.070  Street names.

16.21.080  Alleys.



   When lots are proposed for commercial or industrial use, alleys at
least twenty-four (24) feet in width may be required at the rear thereof.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.090  Grades, curves and sight distances.



   Grades, curves and sight distances shall be subject to approval by the
Public Works Department to insure proper drainage and safety for vehicles and
pedestrians in accordance with the Public Works Construction Standards.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.100  Curbs, gutters, sidewalks and pedestrian ways.



   A.   Curbs, sidewalks, and gutters as shown on the City's Public
Works Construction Standards shall be required.



   B.   When required for access to schools, playgrounds, shopping
centers, transportation facilities, other community facilities, or for
unusually long blocks, the subdivider shall construct pedestrian ways in
accordance with § 16.21.040(B).



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.110  Utilities and easements.



   A.   Easements for public utilities shall be provided and shall not
be less than ten (10) feet in width, direct and continuous from block to
block, or six (6) feet on each side or rear lot lines and side lines where
necessary. When an easement on only one side of lot lines is required, it
shall have a minimum width of twelve (12) feet. Easements of greater width
may be required along natural watercourses, conforming substantially to the
lines of such channels or such channels realigned.



   B.   All utility distribution facilities shall be placed underground
except as hereinafter provided in this Title.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.120  Watercourses.



   The subdivider shall dedicate right-of-way for storm drainage
conforming substantially to the lines of any natural watercourse that
traverses the subdivision, or at the option of the Planning Commission, the
subdivider shall provide by dedication further and sufficient easements or
constructions or both, to dispose of such surface and stormwater.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.130  Block standards.



   The major dimensions of a block shall not exceed six hundred sixty
(660) feet (four hundred (400) feet is preferred) in length or less than two
hundred eighty (280) feet (three hundred twenty (320) feet is preferred) in
length between street centerlines unless modified in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 16.24 entitled "Public Improvements."



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.135  Residential subdivision construction requirements.



   It is the policy of the City to prevent construction of two houses with
substantially identical exterior appearance within sight of each other. To
implement this policy, the Planning Commission and/or City Council shall
establish reasonable standards to evaluate the exterior appearance of
proposed houses. All building plans for new residential buildings must be
reviewed by the Planning Department. Where more than one dwelling unit is
being constructed as part of a new subdivision in which the units proposed
will have similar floor plans and exterior elevations, each building shall be
reviewed by the appropriate City department. Unusual or controversial
building proposals shall be referred to the Planning Commission for review.
Conventional single-family or duplex buildings proposed to be constructed on
individual existing lots may be reviewed and approved by the Planning
Department and be consistent with the Infill Design Guidelines. To ensure
compliance with this section, no building permit may be issued without a
clearance from the Planning Department that the proposed building plan has
been reviewed and approved in accordance with this section and Title 17.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 8 (part), 2017)



16.21.140  Mixed use and non-residential subdivisions.



   A.   Conformance to General Plan. The street and lot layout of a
mixed use and non-residential subdivision shall be appropriate to the land
use for which the subdivision is proposed, and shall conform to the proposed
land use and standards established in the General Plan and Title 17 of the
Gridley Municipal Code.



   B.   Types of mixed use and non-residential subdivisions.
Non-residential subdivisions may include industrial, commercial, and mixed
use subdivisions. Mixed use subdivisions include a mix of commercial and
residential uses.



   C.   Principles and standards. In addition to the principles and
standards in this title which are appropriate to the planning of all
subdivisions, the subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Planning Commission that the zoning and street, parcel and block pattern

(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.020  Requirements.



   At the time of approval of the tentative map or tentative parcel map,
the City Council shall determine, pursuant to Section 16.40.040, the land
required for dedication or in-lieu fee payment. As a condition of approval of
a final subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land,
pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the City, for
neighborhood and community park or recreational purposes at the time and
according to the standards and formula contained in this Chapter. In the

than the City, the amount and location of land to be dedicated or fees to be
paid shall be jointly determined by the City and such public agency.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.030  General standards.



   It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience,
health, welfare, and safety require that five acres of property for each one
thousand persons residing within this City be devoted to neighborhood and
community park and recreational purposes.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.040  Formula for dedication of land.



   A.   Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in the
Open Space Element of the General Plan of the City, and is to be located in
whole or in part within a proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall
dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a
reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the
residents of the subdivision but not designated solely for that subdivision
being created. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant
to the following formulas:



 

Formula based on population estimate: The formula for determining acreage per
proposed dwelling unit to be dedicated shall be as follows:

DU x population x 5 acres = acreage to be dedicated

Dwelling unit 1000 people


The calculation shall be based on the most recent number provided by the
State Department of Housing and Community Development. The average number of
persons per dwelling unit in the as of 2016 is 2.96 persons per unit.



 



   B.   Dedication of the land shall be made in accordance with the
procedures contained in Section 16.40.110.



   C.   For the purposes of this section, the number of new dwelling
units, defined as single family detached, attached, second units, live-work
units or any combination thereof, the fee or dedication of land shall be
calculated at the greatest possible number of units a parcel may be able to
be developed to for any residential or non-residential parcel. In the case of
a condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number
of condominium units. The term "new dwelling unit" does not include dwelling
units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is
filed.



   D.   The subdivider shall, without credit:



      1.   Provide full street improvements and utility connections
including, but not limited to, curbs gutters, street paving, traffic-control
devices, street trees, and sidewalks to land which is dedicated pursuant to
this section.



      2.   Provide for fencing along the property line of that
portion of the subdivision contiguous to the dedicated land pursuant to the
requirements and limitations of Title 17.



      3.   Provide improved drainage through the site.



      4.   Provide other minimal improvements which the City Council
determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for recreational
purposes.



   E.   The land to be dedicated and the improvements to be made
pursuant to this section shall be approved by the City Council.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.050  Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication.



   A.   General formula. If there is no park or recreation facility
designated in the Open Space Element, to be located in whole or in part
within the proposed subdivision, to serve the immediate and future needs of
the residents of the subdivision and the City in general, the subdivider
shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of that land,
plus twenty-five (25) percent toward costs of off-site improvements
prescribed for dedications in Section 16.40.040 and in an amount determined
in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.40.040, such fee to be used
for a local park which bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present
and future residents of the area being subdivided. For the purpose of this
chapter, off-site improvements are defined as those improvements which would
have been required if land had been dedicated using the provisions of Section
16.40.040.



   B.   Fees in lieu of land; fifty parcels or less. If the proposed
subdivision contains fifty (50) parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a
fee equal to the land value, plus twenty-five (25) percent toward costs of
off-site improvements, of the portion of the local park required to serve the
needs of residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in Section
16.40.040, and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of
Section 16.40.070. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the
dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in
subdivisions of fifty (50) parcels or less, where the subdivider proposes
such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the City Council.



   C.   Use of money. The money collected under this chapter shall be
used only for the purpose of acquiring necessary land and developing new or
rehabilitating existing park or recreational facilities reasonably related to
serving the subdivision.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.060  Criteria for requiring both dedication and fee.



   In subdivisions of more than fifty (50) parcels, the subdivider shall
both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the
following formula:



   A.   When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on
the Open Space Element, as the site for a local park, such portion shall be
dedicated for local park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the
provisions of Section 16.40.070 shall be paid for the value of any additional
land, plus twenty-five (25) percent toward costs of off-site improvements,
that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 16.40.040.



   B.   When a major part of the local park or recreation site has
already been acquired by the City and only a small portion of land is needed
from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be
dedicated and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.40.070
shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land, plus twenty-five
(25) percent toward costs of off-site improvements, which would otherwise
have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 16.40.040 hereof, such
fees to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreation
facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreation
facilities in the area serving the subdivision.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.070  Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication.



   A.   When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication value of
the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the
amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to
Section 16.40.040, plus twenty percent toward costs of off-site improvements.



   B.   The fee shall be determined by the following formula:



 

Formula based on population estimate: The formula for determining acreage per
proposed dwelling unit to be dedicated shall be as follows:

DU x population x 5 acres = acreage to be dedicated

Dwelling unit 1000 people


The calculation shall be based on the most recent number provided by the
State Department of Housing and Community Development. The average number of
persons per dwelling unit in the as of 2016 is 2.96 persons per unit.



 



   C.   Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be approved
by the City Council.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.080 Determination of fair market value.



   The fair market value shall be determined upon a written appraisal
prepared by an appraiser who is acceptable to both the City and the
subdivider. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the subdivider. The
appraisal will be made immediately prior to the filing of the final map. The
subdivider shall notify the City of the expected filing date at least six
weeks prior to filing of the final map. If more than one year elapses prior
to the filing of the final map, the City will prepare a new appraisal and
will bill the subdivider for the cost of the reappraisal. For the purposes of
this chapter, the determination of the fair market value of a buildable acre,
as defined in Section 16.40.070, shall consider, but not necessarily be
limited to, the following:



   A.   Approval of and conditions of the tentative subdivision map.



   B.   The General Plan.



   C.   Zoning.



   D.   Property location.



   E.   Off-site improvement facilitating use of the property.



   F.   Site characteristics of the property.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.090  Determination of land or fee.



   A.   Whether the City Council accepts a land dedication or elects to
require payment of a fee in-lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be
determined by consideration of the following:



      1.   The natural features, access, and location of land in the
subdivision available for dedication;



      2.   The size and shape of the subdivision and land available
for dedication;



      3.   The feasibility of dedication;



      4.   The compatibility of dedication with the open space
element policies;



      5.   The location of existing and proposed park sites and
trail ways.



   B.   The determination of the City Council as to whether land shall
be dedicated or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof,
shall be final and conclusive.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.100  Credit for private open space.



   A.   No credit shall be given for private open space in the
subdivision, except as hereinafter provided. Where private open space usable
for recreational purposes is provided in a proposed planned development or
real estate development as defined in Sections 11003 and 11003.1 of the
Business and Professions Code, partial credit not to exceed fifty percent
shall be given towards the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees
in lieu thereof if the City Council finds that it is in the public interest
to do so and that all the following standards are met:



      1.   Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas
required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be
included in the computation of such private open space.



      2.   Private park and recreation facilities shall be owned by
a home owner's association composed of all property owners in the subdivision
and being an incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only
by a one hundred percent affirmative vote of the membership, operated under
recorded land agreements through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is
automatically a member and each lot is subject to a charge for a
proportionate share of expenses for maintaining the facilities. In the case
of dissolution of the homeowner's association, the former private open space
may be determined to be accessible and useable by any resident of the City.



      3.   Use of the private open space is restricted for park and
recreation purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of
the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated.



      4.   The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable
for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such
factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location.



      5.   Facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial
accordance with the provisions of the Open Space Element of the General Plan.



      6.   The open space for which credit is given is generally a
minimum of three acres and provides all the local park basic elements listed
below, or a combination of such and other recreation improvements that will
meet the specific recreation needs of future residents of the area:



         a.   Recreational open spaces which are generally
defined as park areas for active recreation pursuits such as soccer, golf,
baseball, softball and football, for organized sports and leagues for use,
and have at least one acre of maintained turf with less than five percent
slope,



         b.   Court areas, which are generally defined as tennis
courts, badminton courts, shuffleboard courts, or similar hard surfaced areas
especially designed and exclusively used for court games,



         c.   Recreational swimming areas, which are defined
generally as fenced areas devoted primarily to swimming, diving, or both.
They must also include decks, lawn area, bathhouses, or other facilities
developed and used exclusively for swimming and diving and consisting of no
less than fifteen (15) square feet of water surface area for each three
percent of the population of the subdivision with a minimum of eight hundred
(800) square feet of water surface area per pool together with an adjacent
deck and/or lawn area twice that of the pool.



         d.   Recreation buildings and facilities designed and
primarily used for the recreational needs of the residents of the development.



   B.   The determination of the City Council as to whether credit
shall be given and the amount of credit shall be final and conclusive.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.110  Procedure.



   A.   At the time of approval of the tentative map or parcel map, the
City Council shall determine pursuant to Section 16.40.040 the land required
for dedication. If the City Council requires in-lieu fee payment by the
subdivider, the City Council will set the amount of land upon which the
in-lieu fee will be based at the time of the final map approval.



   B.   At the time of filing of the final subdivision map or parcel
map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land or pay the fees as required by
the City Council as established at the time of tentative map or parcel map
approval. In-lieu fees will be established using current land values at the
time of final map approval with the formula set forth in Section 16.40.070.
The City Council shall set the in-lieu fee based on the fair market value of
the land as determined using the process set forth in Section 16.40.080.



   C.   Open space covenants for private park or recreation facilities
shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the final subdivision map
or parcel map and will be recorded contemporaneously with the final
subdivision map.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.120  Alternate procedure for collection of fees.



   Upon written request by the subdivider prior to the filing of the final
subdivision map or parcel map, the City Council, in their discretion, may
provide for the collection of in-lieu fees at the time of the issuance of any
building permit for any structure or building to be located upon any lot in
the subdivision.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.130  Disposition of fees.



   A.   Fees determined pursuant to Section 16.40.070 shall be paid to
the City Finance Director and shall be deposited into the subdivision park
trust fund, or its successor. Money in the fund shall be expended solely for
acquisition or development of park land, or improvements related thereto.
Accrued interest in the fund may be used for maintenance of existing City
parks in accordance with Government Code Section 66477.5.



   B.   Collected fees shall be appropriated by the local agency to
which the land or fees are conveyed or paid for in specific project to serve
residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five (5) years upon
receipt of payment or within five (5) years after the issuance of building
permits on one-half (½) of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever
occurs first.



   C.   Such fees shall remain deposited with the City until such time
the appropriation or project need is determined for the benefit of the
residents of the City of Gridley.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.140  Exemptions.



   A.   Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for
residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this chapter;
provided however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such
parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a
residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels, the fee
shall be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition
of the issuance of such permit.



   B.   The provisions of this chapter apply to condominium projects or
stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an
existing apartment unless it can be shown the project previously paid in-lieu
fees or dedicated land.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.150  Subdivider - Provided park and recreation improvements.



   The value of park and recreation improvements provided by the
subdivider to the dedicated land shall not be credited against the fees or
dedication of land required by this chapter. The City Council reserves the
right to approve such improvements prior to agreeing to accept the dedication
of land to require in-lieu fee payments should the land and improvements be
unacceptable.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.160  Access.



   All land offered for dedication to local park or recreational purposes
shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street.



(Ord. 824-2016 § 15 (part), 2017)



16.40.170  Sale of dedicated land.



   If, during the ensuing time between dedication of land for park
purposes and commencement of first-stage development, circumstances arise
which indicate that another site would be more suitable for local park or
recreational purposes serving the subdivision and the neighborhood (such as
receipt of a gift of additional park land or a change in school location),
the land may be sold upon approval of the City Council with the resultant
funds being used for purchase and improvements for a more suitable site.

   Whenever, in the course of administration and enforcement of this
title, it is necessary or desirable to make any administrative decision,
then, unless other standards are provided in this title, the decision shall
be made so that the result will not be contrary to the spirit and purpose of
this title or injurious to the surrounding neighborhood.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 3 (part), 2016)



17.00.020  Duties of City Council.



   The City Council shall:



   A.   Render decisions on amendments to this chapter upon receipt of
the recommendation of the Planning Commission;



   B.   Act on appeals of decisions by the Planning Commission.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 3 (part), 2016)



17.00.030  Duties of Planning Commission.



   A.   The City Planning Commission shall:



      1.   Interpret and administer the provisions of this title in
such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the general plan as
interpreted on the zoning map for the City;



      2.   Act on minor exceptions to and/or variances from the
provisions of this title regarding the development of land and construction,
enlarging, or alteration of any building or structure and to grant and revoke

and affairs of the people and the government of the City shall not be
restricted by law in any manner such that the effect of the law would not
serve the intent of this title. It is, therefore, provided in this title that
certain forms of relief from the regulations of this title may be applied by
the Planning Commission.



   C.   The Planning Commission shall, on the basis of all relevant
information and under the standards of this title, make a finding in any
matter of zoning relief. The Planning Commission may make any rules of
procedure, consistent with law which may be necessary or convenient for
carrying out its functions.



   D.   Act on appeals of the decision of the City Administrator or
designee.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 3 (part), 2016)



17.00.040  Zoning administrator.



   The office of zoning administrator is established. The zoning
administrator shall administer the provisions of this title and shall have
all administrative powers connected herewith which are not specifically

shall be erected or enlarged until such use or enlarging has been reviewed
for zoning compliance by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator
shall sign all building plans certifying zoning compliance for each building
permit issued by the City. No certification of zoning compliance shall be
issued where it appears that a proposed use or improvement is not a principal
permitted use or accessory or is not in compliance with the letter of intent
of the regulations of this title, unless some form of zoning relief has been
obtained as provided by Chapters 17.08 and 17.09. No building permit may be
issued by the City without a certification of zoning compliance. Any
certification of zoning compliance based on any materially false statement in
application or supporting documents is absolutely void ab initio and shall be
revoked. No certification of zoning compliance shall remain valid if the use
or structure it authorized became nonconforming in the district in which it
is located.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 3 (part), 2016)

improvement, the zoning administrator shall affix to the pending building
permit a seal certifying that such use, building, structure, or improvement
complies with the applicable ordinances of the City and is suitable for
occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued under
circumstances where expressly permitted in Section 17.54.020.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 3 (part), 2016)



17.00.070  Enforcement, investigations, penalties and violations.



   A.   Investigations, penalties, abatement and enforcement of the
provisions of this title shall be conducted or applied as specified and
regulated in this code.



   B.   All departments, officials, and public employees of the City
vested with the duty and authority to issue permits or licenses shall conform
to the provisions of this chapter, and shall issue no permit or license for
uses, buildings, or purposes in conflict with the provisions of this chapter.
Any such permit or license issued in conflict with the provisions of this
chapter shall be null and void.



   C.   The administration of Sections 17.00.070 and 17.00.080 shall be
the responsibility of the City Administrator/designee.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 3 (part), 2016)



17.00.080  Nuisance designated - Abatement.

   Existing uses, buildings and structures which do not conform to the
regulations of the zoning district where located shall be subject to the
regulations in this chapter, in addition to general regulations contained in
other chapters of this Title, in order to permit the continued operation of
such uses, buildings and structures, while providing for their eventual
elimination. This chapter is intended to be administered in such a manner as
to encourage the abatement of a nonconforming use or building, and the
conformance of nonconforming lots.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.020  Definition.



   A nonconformity is a building, structure, use or lot which, when
erected, established, developed or created complied with all the applicable
provisions of this Title or prior planning and zoning regulations, but which
presently fails to conform to one or more of the provisions of this Title.
Nonconformity shall include a building, structure, lot or use legally
existing and located in the unincorporated territory which, upon annexation
to the City, does not comply with the provisions of this Title. Refer to
definitions in Sections 17.04.152 and 17.04.154.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.030  Unlawful buildings, structures and uses distinguished.



   Buildings, structures and uses which did not conform to the applicable
provisions of this Title or prior planning and zoning regulations when
established are violations of this Title and subject to the provisions of
Section 17.00.070. No right to continue occupancy of property containing such
a building, structure, or use is granted by this chapter, is allowed unless,
such activity, use, or site development is lawfully permitted to continue and
all permits and entitlements required by this Title are obtained.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.040  Types of nonconformities.



   Nonconformities include, but are not limited to, the following:



   A.   Nonconforming buildings or structures.



   B.   Nonconforming use or activity within a nonconforming building
or structure.



   C.   Nonconforming use or activity within a conforming building or
structure.



   D.   Nonconforming use or activity upon land containing no buildings
or only structures incidental to the use of the land.



   E.   Nonconformance with development standards as defined in Section
17.04.051.



   F.   Uses which require a use permit which were not established in
accordance with Chapter 17.08.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.050  Construction approved prior to regulation.



   A.   A building, structure or part thereof which does not conform to
the regulations for the zone in which it is situated, but for which a
building permit, use permit, or variance was issued and exercised prior to
the applicability of such regulations to the property, may be completed,
provided that work is pursued continuously and without delay. Such building
structure or part thereof shall be deemed to be a nonconformity and shall
thereafter be subject to the restrictions set forth in this chapter.



   B.   A right granted by a variance or use permit requiring a
building permit shall be deemed exercised when the permit has been secured,
continuous onsite construction activity such as the pouring of a foundation,
installation of utilities or other similar substantial improvements have
commenced, and the construction is being diligently pursued to completion.
Grading of a site shall not constitute construction activity. For purposes of
this section, a right "requiring a building permit" shall mean a right by
which specific construction activity requiring a building permit is
authorized, which construction activity could not be legally performed in the
absence of the variance or conditional use permit granting the right.



   C.   A right not requiring a building permit shall be deemed
exercised when the activity permitted has commenced to the extent authorized
by the variance or conditional use permit.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.060  Continuance of nonconformities.



   Nonconformities may be continued subject to the provisions of this
chapter.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.070  Enlargement of nonconformities.



   Except as permitted in Section 17.03.110, a nonconformity shall not be
enlarged, expanded, or intensified:



   A.   To occupy a greater area, either on the same or on any
adjoining parcel of land.



   B.   To other parts of a building when the nonconformity occupies a
part of such building.



   C.   To displace a conforming use.



   D.   By use of non-adjoining land for parking, storage or other
accessory or incidental uses.



   E.   By any other change in the nonconformity which has a
significant impact upon the use and enjoyment of any other property in the
area.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.080  Change from nonconforming use to another nonconforming use.



   A Planning Commission conditional use permit is required to change from
one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use. A conditional use permit
must be granted prior to the change in nonconforming use or shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 17.00.070.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.090  Repairs and alterations.



   A.   Structural alterations shall be permitted in nonconforming
buildings or structures with the granting of a conditional use permit. Only
such repairs as are a part of normal, necessary maintenance shall be
permitted in nonconforming buildings or structures without an entitlement.



   B.   Such repairs shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the
replacement value of the building or structure in any one (1) year.



   C.   Structural alterations shall not be permitted in buildings or
structures in which a nonconforming use exists.



   D.   Notwithstanding subsections A. B. and C. of this section, all
repairs or alterations otherwise required by law shall be permitted.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.100  Change to nonconforming use.



   A.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the
Planning Commission may issue a use permit to authorize an addition,
enlargement or relocation of a nonconforming building, structure, or use, or
to authorize a change of a nonconforming use to a similar or less intensive
nonconforming use, upon a determination that the benefit to the public
health, safety or welfare exceeds any detriment inherent in such change.



   B.   The procedural and substantive requirements for any hearing to
consider changes to a nonconformity as provided in this section shall be the
same as those for a use permit provided in Chapter 17.08. Both the standards
in this section and the standards in Chapter 17.08 must be satisfied before
an application for a change to a nonconformity may be approved.



(Ord. 822-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.110  Termination by discontinuance of use.



   A.   The discontinuance of a legal, nonconforming use for a
continuous period of one (1) year shall terminate all rights in such
conformity.



   B.   The discontinuance of a legal nonconforming use on a parcel of
land containing no buildings and containing only structures incidental to the
use of such land for a continuous period of three (3) months shall terminate
all rights in such nonconformity.



   C.   The non-renewal of a business license establishes a presumption
that the activity for which it was granted has been discontinued.



   D.   The abandonment of any nonconformity shall terminate all rights
herein.



(Ord. 822- 2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.03.120  Termination by destruction.



   If a nonconforming building or structure, or a conforming building or
structure used for a nonconforming use, is damaged, destroyed, or demolished,
the right to continue occupancy of the nonconforming building or structure,
or to continue the nonconforming use shall cease; provided, however, that
such building or structure may be repaired or rebuilt and reoccupied as
follows:



   A.   If the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of
the building or structure does not exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the
total replacement value of the building or structure prior to damage or
destruction, the building or structure may be restored and the use continued
if such restoration is started within one (1) year of the date of damage or
destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.



   B.   If the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of
the building exceeds seventy-five percent (75%) of the total replacement
value of the building or structure prior to damage or destruction, a use
permit shall be required to authorize the restoration of such building or
structure and continue the use, upon a determination that the benefit to the
public health, safety or welfare exceeds any detriment inherent in the
restoration. The procedural and substantive requirements for any hearing to
consider restoration of a nonconforming building or structure as provided in

detail or illegibility of the official zoning map there is any uncertainty,
contradiction or conflict as to the intended location of any zoning district
boundary as shown thereon, the planning director shall make an interpretation
of the map upon request of any person. Any person aggrieved by any such
interpretation may appeal to the Planning Commission. The interpretation of

that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed
to be such boundary lines.



      3.   Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the
location of any such zoning district boundary line, unless indicated by
dimensions shown on the zoning map, shall be determined by the use of the map
scale shown thereon.



      4.   If, after the application of the provisions of this
section, uncertainty still exists as to the exact location of a zoning
district boundary line, the boundary shall be determined in a reasonable
manner by appeal to the City Council, considering the history of uses of
property and history of zoning ordinances and amendments in the City as well
as all other relevant facts.



   D.   Prezoning. When initiated by lawful petition, by recommendation
of the Planning Commission or by action of the City Council, an area outside
the city boundary but within the planning area may be prezoned under the
provisions and regulations of this Title. The prezoned area



will not be subject to the legal force or effect of this Title until such
time as the prezoned area is annexed to the City as provided by law. Any and
all prezoned areas shall be recorded on the zoning map of the city. The
procedures for initiation, hearings and action shall be as provided for
rezoning in Chapter 17.06.

17.16.010  Intent.



   The purpose of the UR Urban Reserve District is to defer urban
development in areas adjacent to future growth areas until a determination is
made that public utilities, costs, and maintenance thereof, are available to
serve future growth, restrict development into such areas until all infill
sites within the City and Planned Growth areas are completely built out, no
additional area is available to serve the community, and to protect growth
into viable commercial agricultural areas until no other option is available
to serve the buildout of the City of Gridley for annexed lands within the
Sphere of Influence.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 5 (part), 2016)



17.16.020  Findings for development.

amendment of the General Plan to a different land use designation:



   A.   Development of the Urban Reserve area can be planned and phased
to ensure efficient delivery of public infrastructure and services.



   B.   The Planned Growth Area is approaching buildout, and the Urban
Reserve area will be needed to accommodate population and/or employment
growth consistent with the goals of the General Plan.



   C.   The Urban Reserve area is required to accommodate land uses
with extraordinary public benefits, such as a local employment center, that
cannot feasibly be developed on lands within the existing City limits, Sphere
of Influence, or Planned Growth Area.



   D.   The results of a Public Service Facilities Study finds that
based upon the findings made above in  subsections A. through C. above, that
there would not be a financial burden placed on the City to provide services
in life safety, water, sanitary sewer, and electric.

feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the square footage
of the child care facility up to a combined maximum of 35% of the project
square footage without the density bonus; or



      2.   An additional incentive that contributes significantly to
the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility.



   B.   Child care facility requirements. The City shall require, as a
condition of approval to the housing development, the following:



      1.   The child care facility shall remain in operation for a
period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during
which the affordable units are required to remain affordable per this
Chapter; and,



      2.   Of the children who attend the child care facility, the
children of very low income households, lower income households or families
of moderate income households shall equal a percentage that is equal to or
greater than the percentage of affordable units in the housing development
that are required for very low, low or families of moderate income households.



   C.   Child care facility criteria. The City shall not be required to
provide a density bonus or incentive for a child care facility if it finds,
based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care
facilities.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 11 (part), 2016)



17.28.080  Donation of land.



   A.   Donation of land density bonus. When a developer of a tentative
subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development donates land to
the City, the developer shall be entitled to a density bonus above the
otherwise maximum allowable residential density, up to a maximum of 35%
depending on the amount of land donated (see Section 17.28.050 of this
Chapter). This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density
permitted by Section 17.28.040 of this Chapter up to a maximum combined
density increase of 35% if an applicant seeks both the increase required by
Section 17.28.040 and this section of this Chapter.



   B.   The developer shall be eligible for the density bonus for the
donation of land, if all of the following conditions are met:



      1.   The developer shall donate and transfer land no later
than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or
residential development application;



      2.   The developable acreage and zoning classification of the
land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units
affordable to very low income households in the amount not less than 10% of
the residential units in the proposed development;



      3.   The transferred land is at least one acre in size or of
sufficient size to permit development of at least 40 units, has the
appropriate general plan designation, is appropriately zoned for development
as affordable housing, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities
and infrastructure. The transferred land shall have appropriate zoning and
development standards to make the development of the affordable units
feasible. No later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map,
parcel map, or of the residential development, the transferred land shall
have all of the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary
for the development of the very low income units on the transferred land,
except that the City may subject the proposed development to subsequent
design review if the design is not reviewed by the local government prior to
the time of transfer;



      4.   The transferred land and the affordable units shall be
subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units
consistent with Section 17.28.110 of this Chapter if required by financing
programs or subsidy programs;



      5.   The land is transferred to the City or to a housing
developer approved by the City. The City may require the developer to
identify and transfer the land to the affordable housing developer; and,



      6.   The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the
proposed development or, if the City determines appropriate, within
one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed development.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 11 (part), 2016)



17.28.090  General guidelines.



   A.   Location of bonus units. As required by California Government
Code Section 65915(g), the location of density bonus units within the
qualifying housing development may be at the discretion of the developer, and
need not be in the same area of the project where the units for the lower
income households are located as long as the density bonus units are located
within the same housing development.



   B.   Preliminary review. A developer may submit to the planning and
redevelopment department a preliminary proposal for the development of
housing pursuant to this Chapter prior to the submittal of any formal
application for a density bonus. The City shall, within 90 days of receipt of
a written proposal, notify the housing developer in writing of either (1) any
specific requirements or procedures under this Chapter, which the proposal
has not met, or (2) the proposal is sufficient for preparation of an
application for density bonus.



   C.   Infrastructure and supply capacity. Criteria to be considered
in analyzing the requested bonus will include the availability and capacity
of infrastructure (water, sewer, road capacity, and the like) and water
supply to accommodate the additional density.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 11 (part), 2016)



17.28.100  Findings for approval for density bonus and or incentive(s).



   A.   Density bonus approval. The following finding shall be made by
the approving authority in order to approve a density bonus request:



      1.   The density bonus request meets the requirements of this
Chapter.



   B.   Density bonus approval with incentive(s). The following
findings shall be made by the Approving Authority in order to approve a
density bonus and incentive(s) request:



      1.   The density bonus request meets the requirements of this
Chapter;



      2.   The incentive is required in order to provide affordable
housing; and



      3.   Approval of the incentive(s) will have no specific
adverse impacts upon health, safety, or the physical environment or on any
real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical
Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily
mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the
development unaffordable to very low, low, and moderate income households.



   C.   Denial of a request for an incentive(s). The approving
authority shall make the following findings prior to disallowing an incentive
(in the case where an accompanying density bonus may be approved, or in the
case of where an incentive(s) is requested for senior housing or child care
facility):



      1.   That the incentive is not necessary in order to provide
for affordable housing costs as defined in Section 17.28.020 of this Chapter,
or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Section
17.28.020 of this Chapter.



      2.   That the incentive would result in specific adverse
impacts upon health, safety, or the physical environment or on any real
property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources
and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid
the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to
very low, low, and moderate income households.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 11 (part), 2016)



17.28.110  Affordable housing agreement required.



   A.   Agreement required. In approving a density bonus, the
associated permit or tentative map shall require that an affordable housing
agreement, or other form of agreement as approved by the City attorney,
effectuating the terms of affordability of the development be executed prior
to effectuation of the permit or recordation of the final map.



   B.   Continued availability. The density bonus request shall include
the procedures proposed by the developer to maintain the continued
affordability of all affordable income density bonus units and shall be
evidenced by an affordable housing agreement as follows:



      1.   An applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure,
continued affordability of all very low and low income units that qualified
the applicant for the award of the density bonus for 30 years or a longer
period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing
assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program.
Rents for the lower income density bonus units shall be set at an affordable
rent as defined in Section 17.28.020 of this Chapter. Owner-occupied units
shall be available at an affordable housing cost as defined in Section
17.28.020 of this Chapter.



      2.   An applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure
that, the initial occupants of the moderate income units are directly related
to the receipt of the density bonus in the common interest development as
defined in Section 1351 of the California Civil Code, are persons and
families of moderate income, as defined in Section 17.28.020 of this Chapter
and that the units are offered at an affordable housing cost, as that cost is
defined in Section 17.28.020 of this Chapter. The City shall enforce an
equity-sharing agreement unless it is in conflict with the requirements of
another public funding source or law. The following apply to the
equity-sharing agreement:



         a.   Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain
the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller's
proportionate share of appreciation. The City shall recapture any initial
subsidy and its proportionate share of appreciation, which shall then be used
within three years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of
Section 33328.2 of the California Health and Safety Code that promote home
ownership.



         b.   For purposes of this subdivision, the City's
initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the
time of initial sale minus the initial sale price to the moderate income
household plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage
assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market
value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial
market value.



         c.   For purposes of this subdivision, the City's
proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the
initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial
sale.

      1.   The total combined area of all incidental signage that is
displayed on buildings or poles on a single lot may not exceed one percent
(1%) of the area of the lot on which the signs are located.

(30) days in any twelve month period.



      3.   Prior to the use of such signage, an administrative
permit shall be obtained from the planning office. No fee shall be charged
for the permit.



   D.   Off-premises directory signage. All signs which advertise or
promote business or services, including the availability of real or personal
property for sale, where such business, goods, services or property, as the
case may be, are not found or located on the parcel of property where the
sign is located. Specifically included within the definition of "off-premises
directory signage" are all signs which fall within the provisions of
California Civil Code Section 713. Off-premises directory signage is not
permitted, except upon approval of a use permit and shall be subject to the
following additional restrictions:



      1.   An off-premises directory shall be mounted on or adjacent

         d.   The owner's or agent's address and telephone number.



      7.   As to any sign governed by the provisions of California
Civil Code Section 713, aside from the fact that at least one sign which
contains the above information shall be allowed for each parcel subject to a
use permit application pursuant to this subsection, the parameter for
approval of a use permit for such sign shall not be in any other way
restricted and, in particular, the use permit may place reasonable
restrictions on location, dimensions and design and may further take into
consideration any adverse effect on public safety, including traffic safety.



      8.   As to any sign governed by the provisions of California
Civil Code Section 713, the applicant for a use permit (at the applicant's
discretion and subject to the requirements stated herein), after submission
of a completed use permit application and payment of all required fees, may
cause a sign to be erected which contains the information specified in
subsection D.6., above, provided that such sign must be relocated and/or
modified to comply with the requirements of the use permit that is
subsequently issued. Any sign so erected must be located entirely on private
property owned or controlled by the applicant, and cannot be greater than
five feet (5') in height and cannot exceed 32 square feet of area. The use
permit may allow signage of different parameters. The failure to comply with
the provisions of this section (including the failure to relocate or modify
the sign to conform to the requirements of the use permit) shall be a
violation of this Title for which the owner of the property where the sign is
located, as well as any other person, firm or corporation causing placement
of the sign shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.00.



   E.   Exempt signage. The following signage is exempt from
limitations on height or area, and shall not be included in area calculations
for business identification or incidental signage:



      1.   Signage displayed in the "feature windows" of the
traditional recessed foyer of a theater.



      2.   Signage displayed without benefit of any special
structure, frame or other mounting equipment.

restrictions includes identification or incidental messages displayed from
banners, A-frame (sandwich board) structures, and other relatively durable
structures or frames used primarily to display continuously changing
messages, whether mounted on a building or other structure, or placed
elsewhere on the lot.



   F.   Measured area of signage. The measured area of a sign shall be
as follows:



      1.   The measured area of a sign shall be the collective area
required to encompass the entire visual display, including all words and
graphics, from top to bottom and side to side.



      2.   For double-sided signs such as projecting signs and
freestanding signs, the area of the reverse or second side shall not be
included in calculations of total area of signage displayed.



   G.   Other building signage requirements. The manner in which
signage is displayed on a building shall be as follows:

(Ord. 823-2016 § 25 (part), 2016)



17.74.060  Electromagnetic radiation.



   The following standards shall apply:



   A.   General. It is unlawful to operate, or cause to be operated,
any planned or intentional source of electromagnetic radiation for such
purposes as communication, experimentation, entertainment, broadcasting,
heating, navigation, therapy, vehicle velocity measurement, weather survey,
aircraft detection, topographical survey, personal pleasure, or any other use
which does not comply with the current regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission. Further, the operation in compliance with the
Federal Communications Commission regulations is unlawful if such radiation
causes an abnormal degradation in performance of other electromagnetic
radiators or electromagnetic receptors of quality and proper design because
of proximity, primary field, blanketing, spurious re-radiation, harmonic
content, modulation or energy conducted by power or telephone lines. The
determination of "abnormal degradation in performance" and with good
engineering practices is defined in the latest principles and standards of
the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Institute of Radio
Engineers, and the Electronic Industries Association. In case of any conflict
between the latest standards and principles of the above groups, the
following precedence in the interpretation of the standards and principles
shall apply:



      1.   American Institute of Electrical Engineers.



      2.   Institute of Radio Engineers.



      3.   Electronic Industries Association.



   It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to operate or cause
to be operated, maintain or cause to be maintained, any planned or
intentional sources of electromagnetic energy, with a radiated power in
excess of one thousand watts.



   B.   Electromagnetic Interference. For the purpose of these
regulations, "electromagnetic interference" shall be by the use of electrical
equipment other than planned and intentional sources of electromagnetic
energy which interfere with the proper operation of electromagnetic receptors
of quality and proper design. It is unlawful to operate or to cause to be
operated any source of electromagnetic interference, by the radiation or
transmission from which it is detectable beyond the lot line of the property
on which the source is located.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 25 (part), 2016)

convenience for vehicles, pedestrians and the general public by requiring
well designed off-street parking areas.



(Ord. 823- 2016 § 26 (part), 2016)



17.76.020  General provisions.



   A.   Accessible off-street parking and loading areas shall be
provided and maintained for all uses based on the anticipated occupancy of a
given building, structure, or area of land.



   B.   The requirements of this Chapter shall be applied and evidence
of compliance provided prior to issuance of any building permit, certificate
of occupancy, business license or other approval by the City which would
authorize the construction or expansion of any building or structure or any
change in type or intensity of use or occupancy which would require an
increase in the number of parking spaces provided.



   C.   At the time an existing use is expanded or changed to another
use, the regulations apply only to that portion of the development initiated
after adoption of the ordinance in 1984, with the following exceptions:



      1.   No existing parking spaces may be eliminated to
accommodate new development, except for those spaces which may exceed the
number of spaces required for the existing use and the proposed new
development combined.



      2.   No existing parking spaces may be counted toward the
number of spaces required for new development (or a change of use), except
that the total number of spaces provided need not exceed the number required
for the existing use and the proposed new use or development combined.



   D.   When an existing use provides inadequate parking according to
adopted code, and a change is proposed to a use which requires even more
parking, an incremental increase in parking shall be provided which is equal
to the difference between what is required for the old use and the new use.
Example - 5000 square-feet of retail space (17 spaces required) being
converted to a restaurant seating 60 people (20 spaces required) must provide
3 more spaces.

rehabilitation of existing single family residences without requiring
compliance with the off street parking provisions of this Chapter.



   B.   Building permits may be issued for the remodeling and/or
enlargement of existing single family residences which do not have two off
street parking spaces in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter,
subject to the following considerations:



      1.   The proposed work will not change the character or
intensity of the use of the property.



      2.   No existing off-street parking spaces will be eliminated
or reduced in size by the proposed work.



      3.   The proposed work complies with all other provisions of
the Gridley Municipal Code.

17.76.030  Number of spaces.



   The number of off-street parking spaces required for various uses or
occupancies shall be determined in accordance with the following principles
and standards:



   A.   When two or more uses are located in the same building or on
the same parcel, the required number of parking spaces equals the sum of the
separate requirements for each use, reduced by an amount determined by the
Planning Commission, but not more than twenty-five (25) percent.



   B.   An adequate number of parking spaces shall be provided and
designated for use by disabled persons, as specified in Title 24, California
Administrative Code. These spaces shall be complete with required access
areas and ramps as necessary to facilitate use by disabled persons.



   C.   An adequate number of bicycle racks or similar facilities shall

17.81.090  Use and maintenance standards and requirements.



   A.   An accessory structure may not be allowed as the principle use
in any allowed zone. No accessory structure shall be allowed to be placed on
a vacant site without the primary use first established.



   B.   All accessory structures of any size shall be maintained and in
good condition, free of obvious deterioration, all exterior surfaces areas
painted, doors and windows operable and structurally intact. Repairs shall be
made and the integrity of the unit/structure shall be maintained.



   C.   Metal Containers shall adhere to the following requirements:



      1.   Metal containers where allowed shall be screened from
view from any public right-of-way or easement. Any unit located closer than
100 feet from a residential use shall be screened from view. Screening shall
consist of the use of materials such as fencing or dense landscaping.



      2.   Metal container may not be used as animal habitation in
any form.



      3.   Metal containers shall not be connected to any utilities.



      4.   Metal containers shall be painted the same color as the
primary structure. Should the unit be defaced with graffiti, it shall be
repainted the same color of the unit, or, the entire unit shall be repainted
to be a uniform color. No paint patching will be allowed.



   D.   Temporary use of metal containers:



      1.   The City Administrator for the City of Gridley or his or
her designee may issue a temporary conditional use permit to maintain a metal
storage container provided such container is utilized for the storage of
construction materials and uses incidental to construction and further
provided that such structure is actually used for the storage of construction
materials to be utilized on the site where the structure is located. If the
location proposed is within the City right-of-way or easements, the applicant
shall obtain an encroachment permit.



      2.   A temporary use permit may be issued for an original term
not to exceed one year (and for a single extension not to exceed six months)
only if all of the following criteria are met:



         a.   The storage container/structure is located on the
site where construction is to occur, pursuant to a current and validly issued
building permit.



         b.   At the time of application for a permit, the
construction site consists of unimproved property (for purposes of this
Section "unimproved" shall refer to property not then improved with buildings
or other structures) or previously improved property proposed for
redevelopment.



         c.   The applicant provides all requested information on
forms as might be prescribed by the City of Gridley Fire Chief to demonstrate
that the requirements for issuance of a permit have been met.



         d.   The applicant agrees, as a condition of issuance of
the permit, to remove the storage container/structure at the earlier of the
time the permit expires or construction is complete.



         e.   An applicant may apply for a temporary conditional
use permit for property that has been improved with buildings or other
structures to store construction materials for additions or remodel of the
existing principal and/or accessory structures. The temporary use permit may
be initially granted for a period of 6 months and allow 1 extension for 6
months.



         f.   For any particular parcel of improved property for
which a temporary conditional use permit has been issued, no further permit
applications or issuances shall occur for a period of 1 year after issuance
of the original permit (by way of example, if a permit is issued pursuant to
this Section allowing a storage container on improved property for the
storage of construction materials, application may not be made for a new
permit, nor shall an additional permit be issued until 1 year have elapsed
following the issuance of the original permit. This requirement is intended
to limit applications for permits under this Section with respect to improved
property and to require applicants to organize their construction projects
such that, to the extent storage containers are deemed necessary during

SPECIAL SITUATIONS



   17.89.010   Intent.



   17.89.020   Applicability.

   17.89.090   Medical marijuana collectives, cooperatives, and
dispensaries.



   17.89.100   Enforcement.



17.89.010  Intent.



   A.   The City Council hereby finds that the cultivation of medical
marijuana significantly impacts, or has the potential to significantly
impact, the City's jurisdiction. These impacts include damage to buildings in
which cultivation occurs, improper and dangerous electrical alterations and
use, inadequate ventilation, increased occurrences of home-invasion robberies
and similar crimes, nuisance impacts to neighboring properties due to noxious
odors, and increased crime.



   B.   It is acknowledged that the voters of the State of California
have provided a criminal defense to the cultivation, possession, and use of
marijuana for medical purposes through the adoption of the Compassionate Use
Act in 1996 pursuant to Proposition 215 codified in Health and Safety Code
section 11362.5. The Compassionate Use Act (CUA) does not address land use or
other impacts that result from the cultivation of medical marijuana.



   C.   The purpose of this section is to adopt rules consistent with
the CUA and the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA) commencing with Health
and Safety Code section 11362.7 to regulate medical marijuana in a manner
that protects the public health, safety, and welfare of the community,
prevent adverse impacts which such activities may have on nearby properties
and residents without interfering with the rights of qualified patients and
their primary caregivers to possess or cultivate medical marijuana pursuant
to state law.



   D.   The CUA is limited in scope providing a defense from criminal
prosecution for possession and cultivation of marijuana to qualified patients
and their primary caregivers. The scope of the MMPA is also limited; it
established a statewide identification program of qualified patients, persons
with identification cards, and their primary caregivers providing an
affirmative defense to certain enumerated criminal sanctions that would
otherwise apply to transporting, processing, administering or distributing
marijuana.



   E.   The CUA and MMPA do not appear to have facilitated the stated
goals of providing access to marijuana for patients in medical need of
marijuana; the predominant use of marijuana continues to be for recreational
and not medicinal purposes. The report entitled, "California Chiefs
Association Position Paper on Decriminalizing Marijuana" (September, 2009),
states, "[it has become clear, despite the claims of use by critically ill
people that only about 2% of those using crude marijuana for medicine are
critically ill. The vast majority of those using crude marijuana as medicine
are young and are using the substance to be under the influence of THC
[tetrahydrocannabinol] and have no critical medical condition.]"



   F.   Facilities purportedly dispensing marijuana for medicinal
purposes are commonly referred to as medical marijuana dispensaries, medical
marijuana cooperatives or medical marijuana collectives; however, these terms
are not defined anywhere in the CUA or MMPA. Significantly, nothing in the
CUA or MMPA specifically authorizes the operation and the establishment of
medical marijuana dispensing facilities.



   G.   The CUA and the MMPA do not require or impose an affirmative
duty or mandate upon local governments, such as the City of Gridley, to
allow, authorize, or sanction the establishment and/or the establishment and
operation and of facilities dispensing medical marijuana within its
jurisdiction. Moreover, the CUA/MMPA do not create a constitutional right to
obtain medical marijuana.



   H.   It is critical to note that neither Act abrogates the City's
powers to regulate for public health, safety, and welfare. Health and Safety
Code section 11362.5(b)(2) provides that the Act does not supersede any
legislation intended to prohibit conduct that endangers others. In addition,
Health and Safety Code section 11352.83 authorizes cities and counties to
adopt and enforce rules and regulations consistent with the MMPA.



   I.   On August 25, 2008, Edmond G. Brown, the California Attorney
General, issued "Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana
Grown for Medical Use" (the Attorney General Guidelines"), which sets
regulations intended to ensure the security and non-diversion of marijuana
grown for medical use by qualified patients. Health and Safety Code section
11362.81(d) authorizes the Attorney General to "develop and adopt appropriate
guidelines to ensure the security and non-diversion of marijuana grown for
medical use by patients qualified under" the CUA/MMPA. Nothing in the
Guidelines imposes an affirmative mandate or duty upon local governments,
such as the City of Gridley, to allow, sanction, or permit the establishment
and/or the operation of facilities dispensing marijuana within their
jurisdictional limits.



   J.   Marijuana remains an illegal substance under the Federal
Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801, et. seq. and is classified as a
"Schedule I Drug" which is defined as a drug or other substance that has a
high potential for abuse, which is not currently accepted as medical use for
treatment in the United States, and it has not been accepted as safe for its
use under medical supervision. Furthermore, the Federal Controlled Substances
Act (FCSA) makes it unlawful for any person to cultivate, manufacture,
distribute or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute or
dispense marijuana. The Federal Controlled Substances Act contains no
statutory exemption for the possession of marijuana for medical purposes. The
City of Gridley does not wish to be in violation of federal law.



   K.   The City has the power to regulate permissible land uses
throughout the City and to enact regulation for the preservation of public
health, safety, and welfare of its residents and community pursuant to the
City of Gridley's police powers as authorized in Article XI, Section 7 of the
California Constitution. The City also has the power through the City Council
to declare actions and activities that constitute a public nuisance pursuant
to Government Code 38771.



   L.   The City Council finds that neither the CUA nor the MMPA
preempts the City's exercise of its traditional police powers in enacting
land use and zoning regulations, as well as legislation for preservation of
public health, safety, and welfare, such as this zoning ordinance prohibiting
the cultivation and establishment and operation of medical marijuana
cooperatives and collectives within the City.



   M.   The City Council finds that the public health, safety, and
general welfare of the City and its residents necessitates and requires the
adoption of this zoning ordinance, prohibiting the cultivation and the
establishment and operation of medical marijuana cooperatives and
collectives, and prohibits the processing, transport and/or delivery of
marijuana and its products in order to: (a) protect and safeguard against the
detrimental secondary negative effects and adverse impacts of facilities
dispensing medical marijuana; (b) preserve and safeguard minors, children,
and students in the community from the deleterious impacts of medical
marijuana cultivation and facilities; and (c) preserve the City's law
enforcement services, in that monitoring and addressing the negative
secondary effects and adverse impacts will likely burden the City's law
enforcement resources. The City Council further finds that due to negative
secondary effects and adverse impacts of facilities dispensing medical
marijuana, the establishment and operation of these facilities will
negatively impact the City.



   N.   The zoning code, Title 17, of the Gridley Municipal Code, is
consistent with the City of Gridley 2030 General Plan's goals, policies, and
objectives and do not permit or contemplate the cultivation of marijuana nor
the establishment or operation of medical marijuana cooperatives,
collectives, or similar facilities that engage in dispensing of marijuana for
medical purposes.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 36 (part), 2016)



17.89.020  Applicability.



   A.   Nothing in this Chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed,
to burden any defense to criminal prosecution under the CUA/MMPA.



   B.   Nothing in this Chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed,
to make legal any cultivation, sale or other use of medical marijuana that is
otherwise prohibited under California law.



   C.   Nothing in this Chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed,
to preclude any landlord from limiting or prohibiting medical marijuana
cultivation by tenants.



   D.   Nothing in this Chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed
to exempt any activity related to the cultivation of medical marijuana from
any applicable electrical, plumbing, land use, or other building or land use
standards or permitting requirements.



   E.   All cultivation and sale of medical marijuana within the City
shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter.



   F.   Any medical marijuana cultivation that legally occurred prior
to the effective date of this ordinance does not have non-conforming rights
provided in Chapter 17.03.



(Ord. 823-2016 § 36 (part), 2016)



17.89.030  Definitions.



   As used herein the following definitions shall apply:



   A.   "Cultivation" means the planting, growing, harvesting, drying,
or processing of marijuana plants or any part thereof.



   B.   "Fully enclosed and secure structure" means a space within a
building that complies with the California Building Code, as adopted in the
City, or, if exempt from permit requirements, that has a complete roof
enclosure supported by connecting walls extending from the ground to the

by the summary abatement procedure set forth in subsection C. of this section.



   C.   Summary abatement procedure. The City Administrator/designee
(hereafter, the "enforcement official"), are hereby authorized to order the
abatement of any violation of this section by issuing a notice to abate. The
notice shall:



      1.   Describe the location of and the specific conditions
which represent a violation of this section and the actions required to abate
the violation.



      2.   Describe the evidence relied upon to determine that a
violation exists, provided that the enforcement official may withhold the
identity of a witness to protect the witness from injury or harassment, if
such action is reasonable under the circumstances.



      3.   State the date and time by which the required abatement
actions must be completed.



      4.   State that to avoid the civil penalty provided in
subsection C.8. of this section and further enforcement action, the
enforcement official must receive consent to inspect the premises where the
violation exists to verify that the violation has been abated by the
established deadline.



      5.   State that the owner or occupant of the property where
the violation is located has a right to appeal the notice by filing a written
notice of appeal with the City Clerk by no later than three (3) business days
from the service of the notice. The notice of appeal must include an address,
telephone number, fax number, if available, and e-mail address, if available.
The City may rely on any of these for service or notice purposes. If an
adequate written appeal is timely filed, the owner or occupant will be
entitled to a hearing as provided in subsection E. of this section.



      6.   State that the order to abate the violation becomes final
if a timely appeal is not filed or upon the issuance of a written decision
after the appeal hearing is conducted in accordance with subsection E. of
this section.



      7.   State that a final order of abatement may be enforced by
application to the superior court for an inspection and/or abatement warrant
or other court order.



      8.   State that a final order to abate the nuisance will
subject the property owner and the occupant to a civil penalty of One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each day that the violation continues after
the date specified in the notice under subsection C.3. of this section, when
the violation must be abated. The penalty may be recovered through an
ordinary civil action, or in connection with an application for an inspection
or nuisance abatement warrant.



      9.   State that in any administrative or court proceeding to
enforce the abatement order the prevailing party is entitled to recover
reasonable attorney fees from the other party or parties to the action, if
the City elects, at the initiation of an individual action or proceeding, to
seek recovery of its own attorney fees. In no action, administrative
proceeding, or special proceeding shall an award of attorney fees to a
prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the City in the action or proceeding.



   D.   The notice described in subsection C. of this section shall be
served in the same manner as summons in a civil action in accordance with
article 3 (commencing with section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of part 2
of the Code of Civil Procedure, or by certified mail, return receipt
requested, at the option of the City. If the owner of record, after diligent
search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in
a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten (10) days and
publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation pursuant to
Government Code Section 6062.



   E.   Not sooner than five (5) business days after a notice of appeal
is filed with the City Clerk, a hearing shall be held before the City
Administrator or a hearing officer designated by the City Administrator to
hear such appeals. The appellant shall be given notice of the date, time and
place of the hearing not less than five (5) days in advance. The notice may
be given by telephone, fax, e-mail, personal service or posting on the
property. At the hearing, the enforcement official shall present evidence of
the violation, which may include, but is not limited to, incident and police
reports, witness statements, photographs, and the testimony of witnesses. The
property owner and the occupant of the property where the violation is
alleged to exist shall have the right to present evidence and argument in
their behalf and to examine and cross examine witnesses. The property owner
and property occupant are entitled at their own expense to representation of
their choice. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Administrator or
hearing officer shall render a written decision which may be served by
regular first class mail on the appellants.



   F.   A final order to abate the nuisance will subject the property
owner or owners and any occupant or occupants of the property who are
cultivating marijuana in violation of this section to a civil penalty of one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each day that the violation continues after
the date specified in the notice under subsection C.3. of this section, when
the violation must be abated. The enforcement official or the City
Administrator or hearing officer hearing an appeal pursuant to subsection
C.5. of this section may reduce the daily rate of the civil penalty for good
cause. The party subject to the civil penalty shall have the burden of
establishing good cause, which may include, but is not limited to, a
consideration of the nature and severity of the violation, whether it is a
repeat offense, the public nuisance impacts caused by the violation, and the
violator's ability to pay. The daily penalty shall continue until the
violation is abated. The penalty may be recovered through an ordinary civil
action, or in connection with an application for an inspection or nuisance
abatement warrant.



   G.   Violation. Cultivation of marijuana on parcels within the City
that does not comply with this section constitutes a violation of the zoning
ordinance and is subject to the penalties and enforcement as provided in
subsections C.8. and F. of this Chapter.



   H.   Penalties not exclusive. The remedies and penalties provided
herein are cumulative, alternative and nonexclusive. The use of one does not
prevent the use of any others and none of these penalties and remedies
prevent the City from using any other remedy at law or in equity which may be
available to enforce this section or to abate a public nuisance.
