SAN CLEMENTE, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE 1996 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
San Clemente, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 21, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
The San Clemente, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1996, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 21, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 21, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 21, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission.

If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

1.20.050 - Correction conditions. 
A.  Applicability of this section. ..... This Section 1.20.050 applies exclusively to building and zoning code violations that do not create an immediate danger to health or safety and that cannot reasonably be cured immediately (hereinafter "correction condition"). 
B.  Correction Period. ..... An offender shall have at least 15 calendar days to correct or otherwise remedy a correction condition prior to the issuance of an administrative citation and the imposition of the corresponding fine. A longer correction period may be granted if the Enforcement Official determines that additional time is reasonably necessary to remedy the correction condition. 
C.  Correction Notice. ..... Upon discovery of a correction condition, the Enforcement Official shall issue a written correction notice to the offender by personal service or by registered or certified mail to the offender's last known address. Such notice shall refer to each code section violated and facts supporting the issuance of the citation.

(Ord. 1203 § 4, 1998; Ord. 1193 § 2(part), 1997) 
(Ord. No. 1656 , § 3, 5-15-2018)  
1.20.060 - Offender's obligations. 
Within ten (10) working days from the date the administrative citation is issued, an offender shall either: (i) pay the administrative fine designated on the administrative citation; or (ii) make a written request for an administrative hearing. The citation shall be deemed to have been issued on the date noted in the citation, if personally served, or on the date mailed, if served by mail. 
(Ord. 1203 § 5, 1998: Ord. 1193 § 2(part), 1997)

Administrative fines shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first violation, two hundred dollars ($200.00) for a second violation of the same municipal ordinance violation within one (1) year, and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each additional violation of the same municipal ordinance violation within one (1) year. The fine amounts for infractions set forth in subsection B of Section 1.16.010 of this code shall not apply to this chapter and shall in no way limit the amounts which may be imposed for administrative fines. 
B.  Continuing of Violation. ..... With the exception of municipal ordinance violations continuing to exist within the correction period provided under Section 1.20.050, each and every day during any portion of which any municipal code violation is committed, continued, maintained or permitted shall constitute a new and separate offense for which the full administrative fine may be imposed. 
C.  Payments. ..... If the offender does not make a timely request for a hearing, he or she must pay the administrative fine within ten (10) working days from the date the administrative citation is issued. 
D.  No Waiver. ..... Under no circumstances shall the payment of the administrative fine constitute a waiver of the offender's right to a hearing. Therefore, an offender may pay the administrative fine within the 10 working day period and also obtain a hearing to protest the imposition of the administrative fine, provided that the offender makes a timely request for a hearing and timely deposits the required hearing fee, as described in Section 1.22.030. 
E.  Obligation to Correct Violation. ..... Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to mean that payment of the administrative fine by an offender discharges or excuses the offender's obligation to correct the municipal code violation. Failure to correct the municipal code violation may result in the issuance of additional administrative fine citations, the commencement of a criminal prosection, or the imposition of any other legal remedy available to the City. 
(Ord. 1203 §§ 6, 7, 1998; Ord. 1193 § 2(part), 1997) 
(Ord. No. 1655 , § 3, 5-15-2018)  
1.20.080 - Administrative hearing. 
A.  Purpose. ..... It is the purpose and intent of the City Council to afford due process of law to any person who is issued an administrative citation. Due process of law includes adequate notice, an opportunity to participate in a hearing, and an adequate explanation of the reasons justifying the administrative fine. 
B.  Request for Hearing. ..... Any person desiring to challenge the issuance of an administrative citation shall, within ten (10) working days from the date the administrative citation is issued, make a written request for a hearing with the City Clerk setting forth the basis of the challenge. 
C.  Notification of Hearing. ..... At least 10 working days prior to the date of the hearing, the City shall, by registered or certified mail or personal service, give notice to the person requesting the administrative hearing or appeal of the time, date, and location of the hearing. In the event a person seeks to challenge multiple citations, the City, in its sole discretion, may consolidate all such citation challenges into a single hearing. 
D.  Hearing Officer. 
1.  The City Manager shall appoint a person or persons who shall preside at the hearing and hear all facts and testimony presented and deemed appropriate (Hearing Officer). 
2.  Any person designated to serve as a Hearing Officer is subject to disqualification for bias, prejudice, interest, or for any other reason for which a judge may be disqualified pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 170.1. The offender may challenge the Hearing Officer's impartiality by filing a statement with the City Manager objecting to the hearing before the Hearing Officer and setting forth the grounds for disqualification. The question of disqualification shall be considered and determined in writing by the City Manager within ten days following the date on which the disqualification statement is filed. 
E.  Administrative Hearing Procedures. 
1.  The hearing is intended to be informal in nature. Formal rules of the California Evidence Code and discovery shall not apply, except that irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded at the Hearing Officer's discretion. 
2.  Each party shall have the opportunity to offer testimony and evidence and cross-examine witnesses in support of his or her case. 
F.  Administrative Order. 
1.  Within ten (10) working days of the hearing's conclusion, the Hearing Officer shall provide the offender with its decision in writing (administrative order).

2.  The administrative order shall contain the Hearing Officer's findings of fact and conclusions and the procedure described in Section 1.20.090 for seeking judicial review. 
3.  The issuance of a decision in favor of the offender shall constitute a dismissal of the administrative citation. The city shall return any funds the offender paid to the City towards the dismissed administrative citation. 
4.  If the Hearing Officer renders a decision in favor of the City, the offender must comply with the administrative order or seek judicial review of the administrative order pursuant to Section 1.20.090. 
5.  Failure to timely and properly appeal shall be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and a waiver of the right to appeal. 
G.  Failure to Attend Administrative Hearing. 
1.  Waiver of Right to Hearing; Fine and Hearing Fee Immediately Due and Payable. The appellant's failure to appear at a hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing, a forfeiture of the hearing fee deposit, as well as a waiver of a right to judicial review of the imposition of the administrative fine pursuant to Section 1.20.090. An appellant's failure to appear at the hearing shall be presumed an admission of guilt to the municipal code violation charges as indicated on the administrative citation. The administrative fine applicable to the administrative citation, and additional hearing fees, if any, shall be immediately due and payable unless an extension is granted pursuant to subsection 2 of this Section 1.20.080. 
2.  Good Cause. Upon a showing of good cause by the appellant, the Hearing Officer may excuse the appellant's failure to appear at the hearing and reschedule the hearing. Under no circumstances shall the hearing be rescheduled more than one time; provided, however, that if, after the first rescheduled hearing, the appellant pays a deposit in the amount of the administrative fine, or fines, and all applicable hearing fees, the hearing may be rescheduled one additional time. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to mean the appellant is excused from the requirement of paying the administrative fine, hearing fee or fees, or appearing at a hearing. 
3.  Unless excused for good cause per subparagraph (G)(2) above, an appellant that fails to appear at the hearing, or the rescheduled hearing as proscribed herein, shall be deemed to have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and a waiver of the right to appeal. 
H.  Continuance of Hearing. 
1.  Any person requesting an administrative hearing or appeal may request a continuance of his/her hearing date, provided, however, that the person requesting the appeal shall be responsible for hearing officer and City staff, consultant and attorney's expenses, if any, incurred as a result of the continuance. 
2.  No more than two continuances of an administrative hearing or appeal shall be granted, unless the City approves a further continuance for good cause, which shall be determined in the sole discretion of the City Manager or his designee. Any person who fails to appear at a hearing, as described in Section 1.20.080.G, shall not be entitled to a continuance as provided herein; such person's relief, if any, from failure to appear, unless excused for good cause per subparagraph (G)(2) above, shall be limited to the provisions set forth in Section 1.20.080.G.2. 
3.  The City Manager, or his designee, shall have the sole discretion to waive the payment of hearing officer and/or staff expenses incurred by the City as the result of a continued administrative hearing or appeal, in the event the continuance is the result of exigent circumstances, including, but not limited to illness or other unforeseen circumstance.

If no appeal notice is filed within the 20 calendar day period, the decision shall be deemed final; or 
B.  ..... File a petition for a writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 within 90 calendar days after service of the administrative order.

As noted in Section 1.20.070, the administrative fine becomes due and payable ten (10) working days after the date the administrative citation is issued, if no hearing is requested; upon the issuance of a decision by the hearing officer denying the offender's appeal, if no judicial review is sought within the time limits specified in Section 1.20.080; or at such time as a court of proper jurisdiction finds for the City on a judicial review of an administrative order. 
B.  ..... Payment of an administrative fine is delinquent thirty (30) days after the fine becomes due and payable.

Chapter 1.22 - FEES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS AND APPEALS 
 
1.22.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process for imposing and collecting costs associated with administrative hearings and administrative appeals authorized by the San Clemente Municipal Code. The provisions of this chapter ensure that the City is not unduly burdened by the cost to defend unsuccessful, and often frivolous, appeals of the City's administrative remedies, including those imposed in order to protect the public from dangerous buildings and structures, nuisances, and to enhance established residential neighborhoods, commercial, industrial and public districts, open space and recreational amenities. 
(Ord. No. 1655 , § 1, 5-15-2018)  
1.22.020 - Hearing Fee. 
A.  ..... Whenever an administrative hearing or administrative appeal is authorized under any provision of the Municipal Code, and except as otherwise provided by this Municipal Code or state law, the person requesting the hearing or appeal shall pay a hearing fee, which may be established by City Council resolution, except where the person so requesting the hearing or appeal prevails in the hearing or appeal, as set forth in subdivision B below. Any hearing fee shall not exceed the actual costs to the City of conducting the hearing, including, but not limited to staff time to notice the hearing and prepare an analysis of the matter which is the subject of the hearing or appeal, the preparation of any records or documents used in the hearing, including the formal documents upholding or denying the administrative hearing or administrative appeal, attendance at the hearing or appeal by City staff, consultants, and attorneys, and the full fees and costs of the hearing officer retained by the City to conduct the administrative hearing or administrative appeal. 
B.  ..... As used in this section, the term "prevail" shall mean the decision or action of the City for which the hearing or appeal is requested is overturned or reversed in its entirety. 
1.  If the person requesting the hearing or appeal is successful in modifying only a portion of the City's decision or action, then the person requesting the hearing or appeal shall pay one-half of the hearing fees. 
2.  If challenges to multiple administrative citations are consolidated into one hearing pursuant to Section 1.20.080.C, and the person requesting the hearing is successful on one or more, but not all citations, then the person requesting the hearing shall pay one-half of the hearing fees. 
(Ord. No. 1655 , § 1, 5-15-2018)  
1.22.030 - Deposit of Hearing Fee. 
A.  ..... Within 10 business days of the receipt of a request for a hearing or appeal, the City shall notify the person requesting the hearing or appeal of the hearing fee, which shall be based on City Staffs estimate of the costs of the hearing or appeal and complexity of the hearing at the time of the filing of the request for hearing or notice of appeal. The person requesting the hearing or appeal shall deposit the estimated hearing fee with the City Clerk no later than 15 working days from the date of the City's notice of the hearing fee. If such hearing fee is not deposited by such time, the right to the hearing or appeal shall be deemed waived. 
B.  ..... Actual cost of hearing exceeds estimate. 
1.  In the event that the actual hearing fee is more than the deposit paid, and the person requesting the hearing or appeal does not prevail or is successful in modifying only a portion of the City's action or decision, the additional costs, if any, shall become a debt owed to the City by the appellant, and such additional costs shall be due and payable to the City upon the Issuance of a decision by the hearing officer denying the offender's appeal, if no judicial review is sought within the time limits specified in Section 1.20.080; or at such time as a court of proper jurisdiction finds for the City on a judicial review of an administrative order. 
2.  Payment of any additional costs owed to the City is delinquent 30 days after the costs become due and payable. Delinquent costs shall be treated as an account receivable by the City and shall be subject to the City's established policy for delinquent accounts receivable. Furthermore, the offender shall also be required to pay to the City its actual costs of collection. 
C.  ..... In the event that the actual hearing fees are less than the deposit paid, and the person requesting the hearing or appeal does not prevail or is successful in modifying only a portion of the City's action or decision, the City shall refund any excess costs to such person as set forth in Section 1.22.050 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1655 , § 1, 5-15-2018)  
1.22.040 - Refund of Fines and Hearing Fee to Prevailing Party. 
A.  ..... In the event that the person requesting the administrative hearing or appeal prevails, the City shall refund the hearing fee, in its entirety, to such person within 15 working days of the date of the hearing decision. 
B.  ..... In the event that the person requesting the administrative hearing or appeal is successful in modifying only a portion of the City's action or decision, the City shall refund one-half of the hearing fee to such person within 15 working days of the date of the hearing decision.

Returns filed and taxes remitted and actually received by the Finance and Administrative Services Director on or before the same day of the next month following the cessation of business, or on the last day of that month if no corresponding calendar day exists, shall be deemed timely filed and remitted. All returns filed and taxes remitted after such date shall be deemed delinquent and subject to the penalties imposed by this article. 
C.  Successor Liability. ..... If any party acquires an interest in a hotel from an operator who is liable for any tax or penalties under this article, regardless of whether such acquisition results from the sale transfer, or other disposition, the acquiring party shall notify the Finance and Administrative Services Director of the impending date of acquisition at least thirty (30) days before the acquisition becomes complete, or, if the acquiring party discovers or decides to acquire the interest in the hotel less than thirty (30) days prior to the actual date of acquisition, the acquiring party shall immediately so notify Finance and Administrative Services Director of the impending acquisition and the date such acquisition is to be completed. When the acquisition is being accomplished through an escrow, and the acquiring party has knowledge that any tax or penalties are due to the City, the acquiring party shall notify the escrow officer of the estimated amount owed, and the terms of said escrow shall be modified to provide that a portion of the purchase price equal to the amount of the tax and/or penalty owed to the City is withheld from the operator unless, prior to the close of escrow, the operator produces either a receipt from the Finance and Administrative Services Director showing that the tax or penalty has been paid or a letter from the Finance and Administrative Services Director stating that no tax or penalty is due. If such receipt is not presented prior to the close of escrow, the funds withheld pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited with the Finance and Administrative Services Director pending settlement of the account of the seller. In the event the acquiring party has knowledge that any tax or penalties are due to the City, and the sale, transfer, or otherwise disposition of the hotel is being accomplished through other than an escrow, the acquiring party shall withhold a portion of the purchase price that is equal to the amount of such tax or penalty. If the seller does not present a receipt or letter prior to the date of acquisition, the acquiring party, shall immediately deposit the withheld amount with the Finance and Administrative Services Director pending settlement of the account of the seller. Any monies withheld pursuant to this section shall not be released to the selling operator until the selling operator produces either a receipt from the Finance and Administrative Services Director showing that the tax or penalty has been paid or a letter from the Finance and Administrative Services Director stating that no tax or penalty is due. For the purposes of this paragraph, the "date of acquisition" shall be the date and time the transfer of the interest in the hotel becomes complete, regardless of whether such action occurred by the close of an escrow or any other method. 
If the acquiring party fails to withhold a portion of the purchase price and to deposit such amount with the City, as required, the acquiring party shall be liable to the City for the payment of the amount required to be withheld pursuant to this paragraph. Within thirty (30) days after receiving a written request from the successor for a letter stating that no tax or penalty is due, the Finance and Administrative Services Director shall either issue the letter or mail notice to the successor, at that person's address as it appears on the records of the Finance and Administrative Services Director, of the estimated amount of the tax, penalty, and interest that is owed to the City. Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted from relieving the operator of any obligation to pay any taxes or penalties that became due prior to the acquiring party's acquisition. Accordingly, the operator and acquiring party shall be jointly and severally liable for any amounts that should have been withheld pursuant to this section.

The License Collector shall calculate this figure to obtain the average monthly gross receipts of such business and multiply the average monthly figure by the number of months remaining in the current License period, thereby obtaining the estimate of gross receipts of the transferee for the remaining License period. If it appears that the original licensee has paid sufficient License taxes under the gross receipts fee schedule to cover the gross receipts of both parties for the full year, the payment of the appropriate application processing fee will allow transfer of the business license.

A.  Filing of Statement. ..... Except as otherwise provided in this section, in all cases where the amount of business license tax to be paid by any person is based upon the amount of gross receipts, such person shall, before obtaining a business license, file with the License Collector a written statement, on forms to be provided by the License Collector, showing the particular license bracket within which his gross receipts would fall. Such applicant for a business license shall base his estimate on the total amount of gross receipts for his business during the calendar year next preceding the period for which the license is sought. 
B.  Effect of Statement. ..... No such statement shall be conclusive upon the City, or upon any officers thereof, as to matters therein set forth; and the same shall not prejudice the right of the City to recover any amount that may be ascertained to be due from such person in addition to the amount shown by such statement to be due, in case such statement is found to be incorrect. 
C.  Failure to Make Statement. ..... If any person required to make such statement fails to do so, such person shall be required to pay a business license tax at the maximum rate prescribed in this chapter for the business carried on by such person, and shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter.

Following the termination of six (6) months of business activity or the termination of the current license period, whichever comes first, such person may be required to file with the License Collector a new statement showing the actual total amount of gross receipts of such business during the first six (6) months or the months immediately preceding the expiration of the license period. In order to determine such person's proper business license tax for the first period he or she is engaged in his or her newly established business, the License Collector shall take the amount of gross receipts so shown in such statement, or such other amount as he or she shall determine to be the correct amount and shall divide the gross receipts by the number of days in which such person actually engaged in business, and the results obtained shall be multiplied by three hundred sixty-five (365), to determine the estimated gross receipts on an annual basis. The amount so determined shall be applied to the schedules provided in this chapter for such business, and compared with the original business license tax first applied, based on the applicants first estimate of gross receipts. If it is found that the original (estimated) tax was less than the actual amount due, a supplemental business license shall be issued requiring the payment of the additional amount so due.

Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult-oriented businesses. It is neither the intent, nor effect of this section to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent, nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials or merchandise protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of adult-oriented business to their intended market. 
B.  ..... Nothing in this section is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any City ordinance or any statute of the state regarding public nuisances, unlawful exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof.

The purpose of a franchise is to identify and authorize the operation of a cable communications system by a specific grantee, and to identify and specify those terms, conditions, definitions, itemizations, specifications and other particulars of the agreement between the grantor and a grantee. In so doing, a franchise may clarify, extend, and interpret the provisions of this chapter. In the event a franchise and this chapter conflict, both shall be liberally interpreted to achieve a common meaning or requirement. In the event this is not possible within reasonable limits, the franchise shall prevail. Unless otherwise specifically stated, no provision of this chapter shall be deemed to be contractually incorporated into any franchise granted hereunder.

F.  Franchise Non-Exclusive. ..... Grantor may, at its option, grant one (1) or more franchises to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct a system. Said franchises shall constitute both a privilege and an obligation to provide the system and services required by this chapter and the franchise.

Prior to construction or alteration of the plant in public rights-of-way, a grantee shall apply for, pay all applicable fees, and receive all necessary permits. 
I.  Use of Other Utilities. ..... Any person who provides a system or services as defined herein shall be deemed a grantee and must obtain a franchise.

5.  If the grantor determines (as a result of the technical inspection and audit) that the system does not comply with federal, state, or local standards, then a grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to correct or cure the non-compliance either prior to or after the transfer or change of control. In the alternative, the grantor may work with both the current and proposed grantee to cure the non-compliance. The grantor shall be under no obligation to approve any transfer or assignment if a grantee is in breach. 
6.  Before an assignment or change in control is approved by the grantor, the proposed assignee, transferee, or buyer shall execute an affidavit acknowledging that it has read, understood, and will abide by both this chapter and the applicable franchise. 
7.  In the event of any approved assignment or change in control, the assignee or transferee shall assume all obligations and liabilities of the former grantee relating to the franchise unless specifically relieved by the grantor at the time the assignment or change in control is approved. 
8.  If the grantor disapproves a request for consent, then a grantee may submit another request or an amended request for consent or seek whatever address is permitted under applicable law. In such a situation, a new one hundred twenty (120) day time-frame begins to run from the date of the submission of the new, amended, or modified request or application.

A reasonable deposit in an amount determined by the City may be required by the City. In addition, prior to any transfer or change in control, grantee shall reimburse grantor for all of grantor's expenses in connection with evaluating or negotiating a renewal of grantee's franchise, whether or not said renewal was ever finalized or granted. Grantor may send grantee an itemized description of all such charges, and grantee shall pay such amount within twenty (20) days after the receipt of such description.

6.  Payments of compensation made by a grantee to the grantor pursuant to the provisions of this chapter are in addition to, and exclusive of, any and all authorized taxes, business license fees, and other fees, levies, or assessments now in effect, or subsequently adopted in accordance with state and federal law.

A license for which renewal has been denied shall be of no effect or validity after its scheduled expiration. 
E.  ..... If criminal charges are pending against an applicant within a court or public agency, the conviction of which would result in the denial of the application, the City Manager shall suspend review of the application pending the final disposition of the criminal charges. The City Manager shall send written notice to the applicant notifying him/her that the application review is suspended pending the final disposition of the current criminal charges. The applicant may continue to operate the massage establishment pending the final disposition of the current criminal charges. The applicant shall have the obligation of notifying the City Manager when a final decision is reached, and the outcome of the criminal matter (i.e., conviction, dismissal, etc.). The application during the period of suspension shall be treated as if it were never submitted, and the 60 calendar day review period shall be of no effect.

A.  An Enforcement Officer may personally serve the barking dog citation on the responsible person. The responsible person shall be requested to sign a copy of the citation showing his or her receipt of the citation and notice of the responsible person's right to an administrative hearing. Signing the citation shall not constitute an admission of guilt. 
B.  An Enforcement Officer may mail the civil citation by first-class mail. If this method of service is elected, the citation shall be mailed to the address where the barking dog violation occurred or to the address of the responsible person, if known. 
C.  An Enforcement Officer may post a copy of the barking dog citation in a conspicuous place on the property where the barking dog violation occurred if the property owner and/or occupier's name is unknown. In this event, the citation shall also be mailed addressed to the owner of the property where the barking dog violation occurred as reflected on the County's property tax rolls.

(Ord. 1459 § 1 (part), 2008)  
6.10.060 - Amount of barking dog civil fines. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, fines for violating the provisions of this Chapter shall be as follows: 
Fine for first barking dog violation citation issued (per violation) ..... $250.00 
Fine for second barking dog citation within same 12-month period (per violation) ..... 275.00 
Fine for third barking dog citation within same 12-month period (per violation) ..... 303.00 
Fine for fourth barking dog citation within same 12-month period (per violation) ..... 333.00 
Fine for fifth barking dog citation within same 12-month period (per violation) ..... 366.00 
Fine for sixth and subsequent barking dog citations issued within same 12-month period (per violation) ..... 403.00 
Any fine not paid within fifteen (15) days of due date shall be calculated as follows: 
The amount of the appropriate fine listed above added to a late penalty in the same amount as the fine such that the total amount due is double the unpaid fine amount. 
(Ord. 1459 § 1 (part), 2008)  
6.10.070 - Payment of barking dog civil fines. 
A.  ..... After receiving a barking dog violation citation, a responsible person may respond by any of the following methods: 
1.  The responsible person may choose to correct the barking dog violation and pay the barking dog citation fine without contesting the fine in an administrative hearing. In that event, payment of the citation fine must be received by the Director within fifteen (15) days from the date of issuance. Payment shall be made by enclosing the fine amount by check or money order in the self-addressed envelope attached to the civil citation and mailing the envelope to the Director by U.S. first-class mail, postage prepaid. 
2.  A responsible person may choose to appeal the issuance of a citation within fifteen (15) days of the date the citation is served on him/her. An appeal shall only be valid if the responsible person both submits the City appeal form and the City's fee for appeal in a timely manner. Upon receipt of a timely and complete appeal, the City shall provide the responsible person and complainant notice of the hearing date, time, and location. The hearing date shall be no less than ten (10) days and no more than thirty (30) days from the date the City receives a complete appeal. In that event, the fine is due and payable to the Hearing Officer at the conclusion of the hearing if the Hearing Officer upholds the barking dog citation. The Hearing Officer may allow the responsible person an additional period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days within which to pay the fine if, in the Hearing Officer's sole discretion, such additional time for payment is necessary. 
B.  ..... To avoid a late penalty, fines for barking dog violations must be received by the Director within the timeframes specified in subparagraph (A)(1) or (A)(2) above. 
1.  Payment of a fine shall not excuse the responsible person from correcting the barking dog violation. The issuance of a barking dog citation and/or payment of a fine shall not bar the City from taking any other enforcement action regarding a barking dog violation that is not corrected, including issuing additional barking dog citations and/or filing criminal complaints. 
2.  In the event that a fine imposed under the authority granted by this Chapter remains unpaid after it is due and payable pursuant to subparagraph (A)(1) or (A)(2) above, an amount equal to the fine shall be added as a late penalty and the late penalty and fine shall become due immediately. If a Hearing Officer upholds the issuance of a citation in an administrative hearing, the late penalty shall be assessed if the fine is not paid as required at the conclusion of the hearing, or other time for payment determined by the Hearing Officer. 
(Ord. 1459 § 1 (part), 2008)  
6.10.080 - Hearing procedures.

C.  ..... The responsible person and complainant shall be given an opportunity to testify and to present evidence relevant to the barking dog citation. A parent or legal guardian of a responsible person who is a juvenile, under eighteen (18) years of age, must accompany the juvenile to the hearing or the administrative hearing shall be deemed abandoned by the responsible person. Such abandonment shall also constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies concerning the violation set forth in the barking dog citation. 
D.  ..... The citation itself and accompanying complainant's affidavit signed under penalty of perjury attesting to the barking dog violation provided to the Hearing Officer shall be accepted by the Hearing Officer as prima facie evidence of the violation and the facts stated in such documents. 
E.  ..... Neither the Enforcement Officer nor any other representative of the City shall be required to attend the hearing. However, any such appearance and/or additional submission may be made at the discretion of the Enforcement Officer or any other Animal Care Services employee. 
F.  ..... The Director may continue a hearing once if a request for continuance is made showing good cause by a responsible person, a complainant, or a representative of the City. A Hearing Officer may also continue a hearing upon his or her own motion. All continuance requests shall either: 
1.  Be made in person at the hearing; or 
2.  Be made by a written request received by the Director via e-mail, facsimile, or letter at least one (1) week (seven (7) days) prior to the hearing date. 
If a continuance is granted, the parties shall be notified, and a new hearing date shall be scheduled that is within thirty (30) days of the date on which the continued hearing was first scheduled to take place. If the request for continuance is denied, the parties shall be notified, and the hearing shall proceed as originally scheduled. If the responsible person or complainant is not present on an assigned hearing date and no continuance of the hearing has been granted, the hearing shall be deemed abandoned or dismissed. 
G.  ..... The hearing shall be conducted informally and the legal rules of evidence need not be followed. 
H.  ..... The failure of the responsible person to appear at the hearing, unless the hearing was continued per subsection (F) above, shall constitute an abandonment of the administrative hearing, and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies concerning the violation set forth in the barking dog citation. The responsible person's failure to appear shall be noted on the notice of decision completed by the Hearing Officer and mailed to the responsible person and complainant. The failure of the complainant to appear at the hearing, unless the hearing was continued per subsection (F) above shall, if deemed appropriate by the Hearing Officer, be grounds for a dismissal of the barking dog citation. The complainant's failure to appear shall be noted on the notice of decision completed by the Hearing Officer and mailed to the responsible person and complainant. 
(Ord. 1459 § 1 (part), 2008)  
6.10.090 - Administrative hearing decision. 
A.  ..... After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at an administrative hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision to the responsible person and complainant to uphold or to dismiss the barking dog citation based upon a conclusion of whether or not a violation occurred. The Hearing Officer's decision is final. If the issuance of the citation is upheld, the Hearing Officer shall have no discretion or authority to reduce the amount of a fine. 
B.  ..... If the Hearing Officer's decision is to uphold the barking dog citation, the civil fine imposed for the violation shall be due at the conclusion of the administrative hearing, or at some other time as directed by the Hearing Officer no more than ninety (90) days following the hearing date. If the decision is to dismiss the barking dog citation, the civil fine shall no longer be due and payable. 
C.  ..... The Hearing Officer's continued employment, performance evaluation, compensation, and benefits shall not directly or indirectly be linked to the amount of citations upheld or dismissed, or the amount of fines upheld, by the Hearing Officer. 
(Ord. 1459 § 1 (part), 2008)  
6.10.100 - Right to judicial review. 
A.  ..... A responsible person may seek judicial review of the administrative hearing decision by filing an appeal with the Superior Court in accordance with the provisions of California Government Code Section 53069.4 and shall be served on both the Director and City. 
B.  ..... No judicial appeal is permitted where a responsible person has failed to appear at an assigned administrative hearing, or is deemed to have abandoned the contest of the barking dog citation by an unexcused nonappearance at the hearing, or where a citation has been dismissed by a Hearing Officer because a complainant has failed to appear at an assigned administrative hearing. 
(Ord. 1459 § 1 (part), 2008)  
6.10.110 - Collection of unpaid fines. 
The City at its discretion may pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies for the collection of unpaid fines and late penalties. Pursuit of one remedy does not preclude the pursuit of any other remedies until the total fines and late penalties owed by a responsible person under this chapter have been collected. 
Failure to timely remit payment of a citation fine and/or late penalty authorized under this chapter shall be unlawful.

The Animal Services Program Manager or his or her designee shall commence an investigation whenever it is reported to him or her that any animal which, in an unprovoked incident is alleged to have engaged in any activity sufficient for the animal to be declared Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous, or Extremely Dangerous as those terms are defined in Section 6.04.010. The owner or keeper of the animal shall be interviewed as part of the investigation unless he or she is either unavailable when the investigation is being conducted or he or she refuses to cooperate in the investigation. 
1.  If, after reviewing the applicable facts, the Animal Services Program Manager determines that an unprovoked animal has engaged in any behavior that reasonably requires a person to take a defensive action to prevent bodily injury when the person and the animal are off the property of the owner and/or keeper of the animal, and that the animal has no history of having done so within the previous 24 months, the Animal Services Program Manager shall provide a letter to the registered owner and/or keeper of the animal informing him or her of the date, time and approximate location of the animal's act and that if another such action occurs within a twenty-four (24) month period, the animal may be declared to be Potentially Dangerous pursuant to this chapter. The notice shall be sent by First Class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested to the owner at the address on file with CASA. Providing there exists evidence of mailing to the address of record, any failure of the owner to have actually received the notice shall not affect the ability on the part of the City or any appropriate authority from subsequently declaring the animal to be Dangerous or Extremely Dangerous. 
2.  If, after reviewing the applicable facts, the Animal Services Program Manager determines that an unprovoked animal has engaged in any action sufficient for the animal to be declared Potentially Dangerous as that term is defined in Section 6.04.010, the Animal Services Program Manager may declare that animal to be Potentially Dangerous and the owner shall be notified of that fact in writing.

The writing shall further inform the owner of his or her right to appeal the determination pursuant to Subsection C below. The notice shall be sent by First Class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested to the owner at the address on file with CASA and personal delivery left at the address on file with CASA. Providing there exists evidence of mailing and personal delivery left at the address of record, any failure of the owner to have actually received the notice shall not affect the ability on the part of the City or any appropriate authority from subsequently declaring the animal to be Dangerous or Extremely Dangerous. 
3.  If, after reviewing the applicable facts, the Animal Services Program Manager determines that the animal has engaged in any action sufficient for the animal to be declared Dangerous, as that term is defined in Section 6.04.010, he or she may declare the animal to be Dangerous, and the owner shall be notified of that fact in writing. The writing shall include the facts known to the Animal Services Program Manager at that time which caused him or her to reach his or her determination, including the date, time and general location of the incident, shall include a copy of the incident report and those documents relied upon by the Animal Services Program Manager in making that determination, shall reference that the determination is made under chapter 6.28 of the San Clemente Municipal Code, and shall also impose upon the owner and/or keeper those conditions of harboring a Dangerous animal that the Animal Services Program Manager deems appropriate to protect the public safety as contained in Subsection D below. The owner or keeper of the animal may request additional public records pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code Sec. 6250 et seq.). The writing shall further inform the owner of his or her right to appeal the determination pursuant to Subsection C below. The notice shall be sent by First Class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested to the owner at the address on file with CASA and personal delivery left at the address on file with CASA. Providing there exists evidence of mailing and personal delivery left at the address of record, any failure of the owner to have actually received the notice shall not affect the ability on the part of the City or any appropriate authority from subsequently declaring the animal to be Dangerous or Extremely Dangerous. 
4.  If, after reviewing the applicable facts, the Animal Services Program Manager determines that the animal has engaged in any action sufficient for the animal to be declared Extremely Dangerous, as that term is defined in Section 6.04.010, he or she may declare the animal to be Extremely Dangerous, and the owner shall be notified of that fact in writing. The writing shall include the facts known to the Animal Services Program Manager at that time which caused him or her to reach his or her determination, shall include a copy of the incident report and those documents relied upon by the Animal Services Program Manager in making that determination, including the date, time and general location of the incident, shall reference that the determination is made under chapter 6.28 of the San Clemente Municipal Code, and shall also impose upon the owner those conditions of harboring an Extremely Dangerous Animal that the Animal Services Program Manager deems appropriate to protect the public safety as contained in Subsection D below. The owner or keeper of the animal may request additional public records pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code Sec. 6250 et seq.). The writing shall further inform the owner of his or her right to appeal the determination pursuant to Subsection C below. The notice shall be sent by First Class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested to the owner at the address on file with CASA and personal delivery left at the address on file with CASA. Providing there exists evidence of mailing and personal delivery left at the address of record, any failure of the owner to have actually received the notice shall not affect the ability on the part of the City or any appropriate authority from subsequently declaring the animal to be Dangerous or Extremely Dangerous. 
B.  Impounding Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous or Extremely Dangerous Animals. ..... When an animal is declared to be Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous, or Extremely Dangerous, and the Animal Services Program Manager or his or her designee has reasonable cause to believe that owner and/or keeper has not complied with the conditions of harboring the Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous or Extremely Dangerous Animal imposed upon the owner and/or keeper by the Animal Services Program Manager, an animal control officer may seize the animal and impound it at an appropriate animal control facility. Within forty-eight (48) hours, the City shall send a notice to the animal's owner informing him or her that the animal has been impounded. The notice shall be sent by First Class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested to the owner at the address on file with CASA and personally delivered to the address on file with CASA. Providing there exists evidence of mailing and personal delivery to the address of record, any failure of the owner to have actually received the notice shall not affect the ability on the part of the City or any appropriate authority from determining that the animal has been abandoned. 
If the animal control officer has reasonable cause to believe that the animal poses an immediate physical threat to a person or other animal during the seizure or impoundment, the animal may be immobilized, or if immobilization is not practicable, deadly force may be used against the animal. Any impounded Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous or Extremely Dangerous animal shall be kept for a period of not more than thirty (30) days from the date the owner is notified of the impoundment unless extended by the Animal Services Program Manager. The Animal Services Program Manager may extend this period if he or she determines that it is likely the owner and/or keeper will comply with the conditions imposed upon harboring the animal within reasonable time of the end of the impoundment period. The Animal Services Program manager shall provide written notice to the animal owner of the length of the extension. 
If, by the end of the impoundment period the owner and/or keeper of a Potentially Dangerous or Dangerous Animal refuses to comply or asserts that he or she is unable to comply with the conditions of harboring that Potentially Dangerous or Dangerous Animal, the owner shall be deemed to have permanently abandoned all right, title and interest in the animal. If, by the end of the impoundment period the owner of an Extremely Dangerous Animal refuses to comply or asserts that her or she is unable to comply with the conditions of harboring that Extremely Dangerous Animal, the owner and/or keeper shall be notified by First Class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested and personal delivery left at the address listed on the animal's license that, unless the owner of the Extremely Dangerous animal consents within forty eight (48) hours to the euthanization of the Extremely Dangerous Animal, the Animal Services Program Manager shall request a hearing in the Superior Court for the purpose of obtaining a court order to euthanize the animal. The owner shall have the opportunity at the hearing to present evidence as to why the animal should not be euthanized. The Animal Services Program Manager shall endeavor to have the hearing held within five (5) to ten (10) days of filing the petition. The hearing shall be in the nature of the hearing contained in Food and Agriculture Code section 31621, except that the sole question shall be whether, considering the risk to the public, the animal should be released in light of the owner's failure or refusal to comply with the conditions imposed upon harboring the Extremely Dangerous Animal. The provisions regarding abandonment and euthanization shall not apply if the animal has been impounded pending an appeal of the Animal Services Program Manager's determination that the animal is either Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous, or Extremely Dangerous. 
C.  Hearing to Contest Determination. ..... The owner of an animal that has either been impounded on suspicion of being Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous, or Extremely Dangerous, or been declared to be Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous, or Extremely Dangerous under this chapter may request a hearing to contest the Animal Services Program Manager's determination or the conditions imposed upon harboring the animal by submitting a written request with the applicable hearing fee to the Animal Services Program Manager. At the hearing, the owner may introduce evidence to show that the animal is not Potentially Dangerous, Dangerous, or Extremely Dangerous, or that the imposed conditions are inappropriate. The Animal Services Program Manager shall seek to obtain the cooperation of the animal owner to set a date for the hearing within thirty (30) days of receiving the written request therefore, and shall notify the owner by First Class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested and personal delivery left at the address listed on the animal's license of the date, time and place of the hearing. Providing there exists evidence of mailing and personal delivery left at the address of record, any failure of the owner to have actually received the notice shall not affect the ability on the part of the City to proceed with the hearing and the determination of the hearing officer from being final. While failure to hold the hearing within thirty (30) days shall not deprive the City of jurisdiction to hold the appeal hearing, the parties shall endeavor to hold the hearing expeditiously. The City Manager shall delegate the duty to conduct the hearing to an impartial hearing officer who shall preside over the hearing. The persons who can serve as a hearing officer shall include, but not be limited to, an administrative law judge from the California Office of Administrative Hearings. No member of the Animal Services Program Division shall be entitled to serve as the hearing officer. The owner shall have the right to cross-examine any witnesses presented by the Animal Services Authority. The decision of the hearing officer shall be based upon the preponderance of the evidence and shall be final. The decision may be subject to judicial review as provided by law. Any insurance requirement imposed by the Animal Services Program Manager as a condition of harboring an Extremely Dangerous animal as provided for in Subsection D below, will not be enforced from the time an appeal is filed until thirty (30) days after the time the hearing officer makes a determination on the appeal.

A.  Recital. ..... The City Council finds that abandoned drive-in facilities used for providing services to the public in the City, because of their construction and locations, present unique problems which are detrimental to the general health, welfare and safety of the community. From time to time, active business is terminated in certain drive-in facilities due to economic or other reasons and the buildings and grounds tend to deteriorate more quickly than conventional buildings and fall into a state of disrepair, litter accumulates, weeds on the property become a fire hazard, vacant structures are subject to easy occupancy by vagrants, large window spaces attract indiscriminate sign posting, metal structures tend to rust and the paint to peel, all to the detriment of the public health, safety and welfare. The City Council also finds that it would be in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare that provision be made for regulating and controlling the premises of abandoned drive-in facilities within the City limits. 
B.  Definitions. 
 "Abandoned," for purposes of this section as applied to drive-in facilities, shall mean that where such facilities remain closed for a continuous period of six (6) months or if an existing drive-in facility in existence prior to the effective date hereof has been closed for a period of six (6) months, the use and facility shall be presumed abandoned.

C.  Jurisdiction. ..... The Zoning Administrator may, on his own motion or at the request of an interested person, hold a hearing for the purpose of determining whether a drive-in facility and use have been abandoned. 
D.  Hearings. ..... Prior to finding that a drive-in facility or use has been abandoned, the Zoning Administrator shall, on his own motion or at the request of any person, hold a public meeting to determine that the described use and facility have been abandoned. Notice of hearing shall be upon ten (10) days' written notice, mailed to the owners and to the occupant and posted at all entrances to the structures, and one publication five (5) days before the hearing in a newspaper published or circulated in the City. 
E.  Conduct of Hearing. ..... At the time of hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall inquire into and receive evidence relative to the occupant's or owner's ability and intent to continue the use and premises as a drive-in facility. If the lessee or the owner of the facility is unable to demonstrate at this hearing that such use will be continued or exercised within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, then the Zoning Administrator may consider the premises and use abandoned and revoke any Conditional Use Permit under which such drive-in facility was operating. 
F.  Revocation of Use Permit. ..... The Zoning Administrator may, without further hearing, revoke a drive-in facility use permit as herein set forth; provided, the Zoning Administrator first makes findings that such use has been abandoned and that the person or persons lawfully entitled to occupy the premises do not have the ability and intent to exercise the use within a reasonable time. 
G.  Exemption. ..... Where a drive-in facility is temporarily closed or out of business, such use and premises shall not be considered abandoned and subject to the provisions of this section; provided, there is complete compliance with all of the following provisions: 
1.  The condition of the paved asphalt or concrete parking and driveway areas are maintained clean, well-paved and free of holes, weeds, debris and litter; 
2.  Doors are securely locked; 
3.  Windows are unbroken, clean and not boarded over; 
4.  The exterior surface of all buildings and outside facilities are painted a subdued color and kept clean, free from rust, posters and bills; 
5.  No trade names, signs or advertising on the premises; 
6.  No parked vehicles, merchandise or equipment outside of buildings; 
7.  A notice is posted on entrance door stating name and telephone number of person to call in emergency. 
H.  Enforcement. ..... The City Building Official is hereby designated as the Enforcement Officer for investigation and reporting to the Zoning Administrator as to whether there is compliance with subsection G of this section. 
I.  Public Nuisance. ..... Upon revocation of a use permit for a drive-in facility, the City may, in addition to the foregoing, find that the premises are a public nuisance and direct they be abated in accordance with law. 
J.  Appeal. ..... Any person dissatisfied with any determination made by the Zoning Administrator may appeal to the Council in accordance with Ordinance 397 of the City.

The Utilities Director, or designee, or the franchise hauler acting as the agent of the City, may cause the posting of a notice to remove in a conspicuous place on any bin or container deposited, placed or left on any public property within the City in violation of this chapter. Any such notice shall specify the nature of the violation, and shall state that the bin or container must be removed within 24 hours or it may be removed and stored by the City or the franchise hauler, and the contents disposed of, at the expense of the owner. The posting of a notice to remove shall constitute constructive notice to the owner and the user of the requirement to remove the container. 
Subject to the following paragraph, if the container is not removed within 24 hours after the notice to remove is posted, the Utilities Director may remove or direct the franchise hauler to remove and store the bin or container and dispose of its contents. The owner of the bin or container shall be responsible to reimburse the City or the franchise hauler (as applicable) for the actual cost of the removal, storage, and disposal, and all amounts due shall be paid before the bin or container may be returned to the owner.

All other portions of this section shall continue to apply. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the Utilities Director is authorized to direct the immediate removal by the City or the franchise hauler, without notice, of any bin or container placed on public property within the City in violation of this chapter where the owner of the bin or container is unidentified and cannot be ascertained by an inspection of the bin or container.

B.  Whenever the Chief of Police or his/her designated representative determines that graffiti is so located on public or privately owned structures on public or privately owned real property within this City so as to be capable of being viewed by a person utilizing any public right-of-way in this City, the Police Chief, or his/her designated representative, is authorized, upon City Council approval, to provide for the removal of the graffiti solely at the City's expense, without reimbursement from the property owner upon whose property the graffiti has been applied, upon the following conditions:

Residential 	55 dB (A) 	50 dB (A) 
Residential portions of mixed-use, or residences located on property zoned for commercial, industrial or manufacturing land use 	60 dB (A) 	50 dB (A) 
Commercial 	65 dB (A) 	60 dB (A)* 
Industrial or manufacturing 	70 dB (A) 	70 dB (A)* 
 
* Standard only applies if commercial, industrial or manufacturing buildings are occupied during these hours. 
A.  It shall be unlawful for any person at any location within the City to create any noise, or to allow the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied, or otherwise controlled by such person, when the foregoing causes the noise level, when measured on any other property to exceed: 
1.  The noise standard for a cumulative period of more than thirty (30) minutes in any hour; or 
2.  The noise standard plus five (5) dB(A) for a cumulative period of more than fifteen (15) minutes in any hour; or 
3.  The noise standard plus ten (10) dB(A) for a cumulative period of more than five (5) minutes in any hour; or 
4.  The noise standard plus fifteen (15) dB(A) for a cumulative period of more than one (1) minute in any hour; or 
5.  The noise standard plus twenty (20) dB(A) for any period of time. 
B.  In the event the ambient noise level exceeds any of the five (5) noise limit categories above, the allowable noise level under said category shall be increased to reflect the ambient noise level. 
C.  If possible, the ambient noise shall be measured at the same location as the noise source measurement, with the alleged offending noise source inoperative. If for any reason the alleged offending noise source cannot be shut down, the ambient noise must be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the source but at a sufficient distance such that the noise from the source is at least ten (10) dB below the ambient in order that only the ambient level be measured. If the difference between the ambient and the noise source is five (5) to ten (10) dB, then the level of the ambient itself can be reasonably determined by subtracting a one (1) decibel correction to account for the contribution of the source.

Alarm systems include but are not limited to, direct dial telephone devices, audible alarms and proprietor alarms. Devices which are not designed or used to register alarms that are audible, visible or perceptible outside of the protected building, structure or facility are not included within this definition, nor are auxiliary devices installed by the telephone company to protect telephone company systems which might be damaged or disrupted by the use of an alarm system.

The reimbursement fee may be waived by the Central Services Officer or designee when a determination had been made that circumstances exist which will prevent future false alarms or if proof is provided that the alarm was a valid actuation of the system. The reimbursement shall be approved by the Central Services Officer and notification thereof to the permittee shall be made within ten (10) days from the actuation of the excessive false alarm.

Chapter 8.69 - WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR CERTAIN CONSTRUCTION, DEMOLITION, AND RENOVATION PROJECTS[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1642 , § 3, adopted July 18, 2017, replaced in its entirety Ch. 8.69, §§ 8.69.0108.69.120, in effect repealing and reenacting said chapter as set out herein. Former Ch. 8.69 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1286, § 1 (part), adopted in 2003. 
 
8.69.010 - Findings. 
The City Council finds that diverting construction and demolition debris for reuse and/or recycling reduces the amount of such material that is landfilled, assists the City in meeting State of California mandated construction and demolition debris diversion requirements, and is important for the preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the people by reason of the growing problem of construction and demolition debris disposal and its impact upon our environment. The City Council further finds that reuse and recycling conserves valuable resources and energy, promotes greater efficiency in the regional economy, and reduces the overall amount of solid waste, thereby improving our existing environment.

(Ord. No. 1642 , § 3, 7-18-2017)  
8.69.080 - Return of C&D Performance Security Deposit. 
A.  ..... Within 60 days after the completion of any covered project, the applicant shall submit to the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official documentation that it has met the diversion requirement for the project. This documentation shall include all of the following: 
1.  Receipts from the vendor or facility which collected or received each material, showing the actual weight or volume of that material; 
2.  For those projects for which completion and submission of a Waste Management Plan is required by this chapter, a copy of the previously approved Waste Management Plan for the project adding the actual volume or weight of each material diverted and landfilled; and 
3.  Any additional information the applicant believes is relevant to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this chapter. 
B.  ..... Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all C&D debris diverted or landfilled are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practicable, all C&D debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For C&D debris for which weighing is not practicable due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the materials conversion worksheet approved by the City for this purpose. 
C.  ..... The Waste Management Plan Compliance Official shall review the information submitted under subsection A of this section and determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement, as follows: 
1.  If the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement applicable to the project, he or she shall cause the full C&D performance security deposit to be released to the applicant. 
2.  If the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official determines that the applicant has not met the required diversion requirement or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by subsection A of this section within the required time period, then the C&D performance security deposit shall be forfeited to the City. All forfeited C&D performance security deposits and penalties shall be used for the purposes of promoting C&D recycling within the City. 
3.  If the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by Section 8.69.080.A within 60 calendar days after the completion of any covered project then the deposit is forfeited to the City.

8.69.090 - Infeasible Exemption. 
A.  ..... If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may, by separate letter titled "Request for Infeasible Exemption" that is addressed to the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official (a "Request for Exemption Letter"), apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the Waste Management Plan required under Section 8.69.040 of this chapter, or for those covered projects for which completion and submission of a Waste Management Plan is not required, at the time that he or she submits an application for the project. The applicant shall indicate in the request for exemption letter the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement. 
B.  ..... The Waste Management Plan Compliance Official shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. Based on the information supplied by the applicant, and, if appropriate, in consultation with local solid waste haulers, the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official shall determine whether it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement. 
C.  ..... If the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the request for exemption letter submitted by the applicant. The Waste Management Plan Compliance Official shall return a copy of the request for exemption letter to the applicant marked "Approved for Infeasible Exemption" and shall notify the Building Department that the applicant's request has been granted and the applicant's Waste Management Plan (if applicable) has been approved. 
D.  ..... If the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so return a copy of the request for exemption letter to the applicant marked "Denied for Infeasible Exemption." 
E.  ..... Any applicant who is required pursuant to Section 8.69.040 to prepare and submit a Waste Management Plan and whose request for an infeasible exemption is denied shall have 30 days to resubmit a Waste Management Plan form in full compliance with Section 8.69.040 of this chapter. If the applicant fails to resubmit the Waste Management Plan, or if the resubmitted Waste Management Plan does not comply with Section 8.69.040 of this chapter, the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official shall deny the Waste Management Plan in accordance with Section 8.69.070 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1642 , § 3, 7-18-2017)  
8.69.100 - Appeal. 
The applicant or any interested person may appeal to the Utilities Director the determination of the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official. Notice of any appeal from the determination of the Waste Management Plan Compliance Official must be filed with the Utilities Department within 10 days after the date that such determination is made. The decision of the Utilities Director upon such appeal shall be final and shall not be appealable to the City Council or to any other City body or official.

Chapter 8.72 - SPECIAL EVENT PERMITS 
 
8.72.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a uniform procedure for evaluating and permitting both commercial and noncommercial special events which are to be wholly or partially held within the City. The City Council desires to establish such a procedure to ensure the broadest range of special events are held within the City in a safe and orderly manner which causes the least disruption or inconvenience to everyday life. It is also the purpose of this chapter to provide a procedure to both evaluate the level of municipal services required by any special event and to pass that cost on to the special event's organizers. Finally, it is the intent of the City Council to protect the rights of the people to engage in protected free speech and assembly, yet allow for such activities to be undertaken in a safe manner with the least restrictive reasonable time, place, and manner regulations. 
(Prior code § 29B-1)  
8.72.020 - Definitions.

"Noncommercial special event" shall mean any organized activity which takes place in whole or in part within City boundaries, including but not limited to, parades, demonstrations, and exhibits, the principal purpose of which is the expression, dissemination or communication of opinions, views or ideas by verbal, visual, literary or auditory means. The term "noncommercial special event" shall not mean any event whose principal purpose is to promote commercial or for-profit groups, businesses or other similar endeavors of whatever type. Nor shall the term refer to any activity which does not at least partially occur or impact upon the public right-of-way, nor attract more than twenty (20) people during any twenty-four (24) hour period. 
"Permit" shall mean commercial and noncommercial special event permits. 
"Special event" shall mean any commercial or noncommercial special event. 
(Prior code § 29B-2)  
8.72.030 - Permit required. 
No person or entity shall conduct or maintain a special event, or permit its premises to be used for a special event, without first applying for and obtaining a permit, and timely fulfilling any and all conditions of approval imposed upon the issuance of the permit. Any special event conducted by the City will follow the same review process for approval, but will not require the submittal of a special event application or issuance of a permit. 
(Prior code § 29B-3)  
8.72.040 - Interference with special event. 
Unless otherwise permitted by law, no person or entity shall join or participate in any special event in violation of any of the terms or conditions of the permit or these regulations, join or participate in any special event without the consent of the permittee or in any manner interfere with the orderly conduct of such special event. 
(Prior code § 29B-4)  
8.72.050 - Application for special event permit. 
Any person wishing to sponsor, conduct, operate or maintain a special event shall, no less than sixty (60) days in advance of the start of the proposed special event, file a completed official special event permit application with the Beaches, Parks and Recreation Department on the approved form. 
(Prior code § 29B-5)  
8.72.060 - Late applications for noncommercial special event. 
A.  ..... The Director of Beaches, Parks and Recreation shall accept an application for a noncommercial special event which is filed after the filing deadline, providing there is sufficient time to process and investigate the application and obtain all necessary services for the event.

B.  ..... Applications shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established in the City special events policy. 
(Prior code § 29B-6)  
8.72.070 - Findings for denial of a commercial special event permit. 
A commercial special event permit may be denied if it is determined, from consideration of the application and other pertinent information in the record, that one (1) or more of the following circumstances exist: 
A.  Information contained in the application, or supplemental information supplied by the applicant, is found to be materially false or misleading; 
B.  The applicant fails to complete the application form within ten (10) days after having been notified of the need to do so, or fails to provide supplemental information or documents within ten (10) days of being requested to do so by the City; 
C.  The City has already approved or conditionally approved an application for another special event at the same time and place as that requested by the applicant, or so close in time and place as to cause undue traffic congestion, and/or the Police Department or any other City department is unable to meet the service needs or both; 
D.  The conduct of the special event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of aerial or marine navigation, public transportation, or other vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic in the area of its route, or unresolvably conflict with construction or development in the public right-of-way or at a public facility, or block traffic lanes or close streets during peak commuter hours on any of the following streets: 
1.  Streets designated as "arterials" in the City general plan circulation element, or 
2.  Streets or portions of streets determined to be "principal commuter routes" by the City's traffic engineering staff; 
E.  The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of the special event, or its assembly and disbanding areas, is reasonably likely to prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services from meeting the City's established emergency response time; 
F.  The special event is reasonably likely to require the diversion of so many City personnel to ensure that participants and/or spectators stay within the boundaries or route of the special event, or to protect participants and/or spectators, that normal protection to the rest of the City will be unreasonably compromised. The above notwithstanding, nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit because the operation of the special event creates the need to protect participants from the conduct of others, so long as reasonable permit conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection of event participants with the number of City human resources available to police the special event; 
G.  If the special event is a parade, race or other type of procession, it is not likely to move from its point of origin to its point of termination in less than six (6) hours; 
H.  The location of the special event is likely to substantially interfere with construction or maintenance work previously scheduled to take place upon or along City streets, or to interfere with a previously granted encroachment permit; 
I.  The special event is likely to occur at a time when a school is in session, and along a route or at a location adjacent to a school, and the noise created by the activities of the special event would substantially disrupt the educational activities of the school; 
J.  The special event will occur along a route or location adjacent to a hospital or extended care facility, and the noise created by the event would substantially disrupt the operation of the hospital or extended care facility or disturb the patients within; 
K.  The special event has a prior history of creating conditions which jeopardize the peace and safety of the citizenry; 
L.  The applicant has previously violated permit conditions imposed as conditions of approval to a permit; 
M.  The special event endangers the health, safety or welfare of the people of the City or the location chosen for the special event is inconsistent with surrounding land uses. 
N.  The applicant has not obtained written certifications on the form provided by the City that, prior to the special event, all persons who will be selling or serving alcoholic beverages at the special event will have attended a responsible beverage service training class, or if such a class is not available prior to the date on which the special event is proposed, that prior to the special event, all persons who will be selling or serving alcoholic beverages at the special event will have obtained from the City the responsible beverage service training manual, will have reviewed the manual, taken and passed the special event alcohol serving quiz incorporated into the manual, signed the responsible alcohol service agreement and returned all of the above to the City prior to the event.

(Prior code § 29B-8)  
8.72.090 - Grounds for denial of noncommercial special event permit. 
A noncommercial special event permit application may be denied only if it is determined from a consideration of the application, and other pertinent information in the record, that one (1) or more of the circumstances described in Section 8.72.070 (A) through (K) exist. In determining whether or not the noncommercial special event permit should be granted or denied, the City Manager shall resolve all doubts in favor of approving or conditionally approving the application. 
(Prior code § 29B-9)

People other than the operator may not be used in lieu of the operator for maintaining visual line of sight. The use of vision-enhancing devices, such as binoculars, night vision goggles, powered vision magnifying devices, and goggles or other devices designed to provide a "first-person view" from the UA do not constitute visual line of sight of the operator.

(Ord. No. 1541, § 1, 9-6-2011; Ord. No. 1617, § 6, 2-16-2016)

B.  ..... Any responsible person who is present at a residential unit that has a notice posted pursuant to subsection 9.16.030(A) shall be presumed to have notice of the prior violation(s) by virtue of the posted notice(s) and shall be subject to an administrative fine according to the number of violation(s) at the residential unit within the preceding one hundred eighty (180) day period pursuant to the civil fine schedules in subsection 9.16.060(A) above.

The failure of any owner or responsible person to timely file a written request for an administrative fine waiver or payment plan with the City's Finance Director shall be deemed a failure to exhaust the owner's or responsible person's administrative remedies with regard to the same. 
1.  The written request for an administrative fine waiver or payment plan shall be in writing, describe with particularly the extreme financial hardship as to why all or a part of the fine cannot be paid, or indicate what the owner or responsible person believes would constitute a reasonable payment plan for payment of the administrative fine over time. Further, the written request for an administrative fine waiver or payment plan must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City's Finance Director the owner's or responsible person's extreme financial hardship that necessitates a waiver of all or a part of the administrative fine amount or need for a reasonable payment plan. The City's Finance Director is entitled to request additional documentation and information from the owner or responsible person in order to fully assess the owner's or responsible person's extreme financial hardship. The failure of any owner or responsible person to timely submit all requested additional documentation and information to the City's Finance Director as requested shall be deemed a failure to exhaust the owner's or responsible person's administrative remedies with regard to the same. 
2.  Once a complete written request for administrative fine waiver or payment plan is filed with the City's Finance Director, the requirement to pay the administrative fine shall be stayed until the City's Finance Director determines whether to grant or deny the request. 
3.  If the City's Finance Director grants the written request for an administrative fine waiver, the owner or responsible person shall not be required to pay the administrative fine. If the Finance Director determines that the owner or responsible person has the financial ability to pay all or a part of the administrative fine on a reasonable payment plan, the City's Finance Director shall so notify the owner or responsible person and the owner or responsible person shall execute any agreements required by the City's Finance Director to establish the payment plan. Any payment plan established for the payment of an administrative fine under this chapter shall not exceed three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of the City Finance Director's determination. 
4.  The granting of any request for an administrative fine waiver or payment plan shall not excuse or discharge any continuation or repeated occurrence of any violation of this chapter, nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the City. 
5.  If the City's Finance Director denies the written request for an administrative fine waiver or payment plan, the administrative fine must be paid within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of personal delivery on the owner or responsible person or mailing of the City Finance Director's determination. 
6.  The City Finance Director's determination shall be (i) made within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of receipt of the complete request or any additional information as requested by the City Administrative Services/Finance Director; (ii) in writing; and (iii) served either by personal delivery on the owner or responsible person or by deposit in the mail for delivery by the United States Postal Service, in a sealed envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to such owner or responsible person. The decision of the City's Finance Director shall be final. 
G.  ..... The administrative fines and criminal penalties imposed in this chapter shall be in addition to any other fines and/or penalties imposed for violations of local, state, and/or federal law during a loud or unruly gathering. 
H.  ..... Any owner who does not reside within the residential unit and has (i) included covenants within the written lease or rental agreement for the premises on which a loud or unruly gathering occurs that contain specific language prohibiting the activities described in this chapter; and (ii) demonstrated due diligence in abating an unmanageable tenant(s) or responsible person(s) for a loud or unruly gathering shall not be liable under this chapter. Prior to September 1, 2012, an owner who does not reside within the residential unit and has a written lease or rental agreement for the residential unit on which a loud or unruly gathering has occurred shall only need to demonstrate due diligence in abating an unmanageable tenant(s) or responsible person(s) for a loud or unruly gathering to not be liable under this chapter. 
I.  ..... Any owner who does not reside within the residential unit, has a written lease or rental agreement for the residential unit and had the same residential unit posted with a notice pursuant to subsection 9.16.030(A), may file a written petition with the Chief of Police Services, or his or her designee, requesting permission to remove the posted notice prior to the expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day period. The Chief of Police Services, or his or her designee, may grant the owner's written petition upon a satisfactory showing by the owner that the responsible person(s) for the loud or unruly gathering are no longer in possession of or allowed to occupy the residential unit. 
J.  ..... Failure to receive any notice specified in this chapter does not affect the validity of proceedings conducted hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1541, § 1, 9-6-2011)  
9.16.070 - Administrative hearing, appeal.

Any owner or responsible person who, pursuant to this chapter, is (1) subject to an administrative fine or, (2) have had their residential unit posted with a notice concerning a loud or unruly gathering, shall have the right to file a request for an administrative hearing to appeal the imposition of the administrative fine and/or the posting of the premises pursuant to the procedures contained in section 1.20.080 of this Code. Any such request shall be submitted to the City in writing on the form required by the City within ten (10) days from the date of service of the citation, notice of violation or posting of the premises, whichever is earlier. 
B.  ..... The citation, notice of violation, and/or posted notice on the premises, together with any additional documents or evidence submitted by the City, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the respective facts contained in those documents and evidence. 
C.  ..... If the City submits any additional documents or evidence to the Hearing Officer for consideration at the administrative hearing, then a copy of the same shall be served by mail on the owner or responsible person requesting the hearing at least five (5) days prior to the date of the administrative hearing. The failure of any person to receive such documents prior to the administrative hearing shall only entitle the owner or responsible person to a reasonable continuance of the administrative hearing. 
D.  ..... If the owner or responsible person desires to submit any documents or evidence to the Hearing Officer, then a copy of the same shall be served by mail on the City at least five (5) days prior to the date of the administrative hearing. The failure of the owner or responsible person to comply with this requirement shall only entitle the City to a reasonable continuance of the administrative hearing. 
E.  ..... Other than as provided in this section, no other discovery is permitted. The administrative hearing shall not be conducted according to the formal rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in administrative actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state. However, irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. 
F.  ..... Any owner or responsible person aggrieved by a written decision of a Hearing Officer following an administrative hearing may obtain judicial review of the decision by following the procedures contained in section 1.20.090 of this Code.

A.  ..... The amount of any administrative fine imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed to the City. 
B.  ..... At its discretion, the City may pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies to collect unpaid fines imposed pursuant to this chapter. Pursuit of one remedy does not preclude the pursuit of any other remedy. It is intended that persons causing, maintaining, and/or permitting the violation, and not the taxpayers, bear the financial burden of the City's enforcement efforts. 
C.  ..... The City shall be entitled to recover all costs related to enforcing any violation(s) of this chapter that are recoverable under applicable local, state or federal law. 
D.  ..... Any person who fails to pay any fine shall be liable in any proceeding brought by the City for costs incurred in securing payment of the unpaid amount, including without limitation, administrative costs and attorneys' fees. Such collection costs shall be in addition to any penalties, interest, and/or late charges imposed upon the unpaid fine. 
(Ord. No. 1541, § 1, 9-6-2011)  
9.16.090 - Cumulative remedies. 
The remedies provided under this chapter are cumulative and shall not restrict the City's ability to pursue any other remedy to which it is entitled under law or equity. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to preclude the imposition of any criminal penalty, nor shall anything in this chapter be deemed to conflict with any penalty or provision under state law, or prohibit any conduct authorized by the state or federal constitutions. 
(Ord. No. 1541, § 1, 9-6-2011)  
Chapter 9.20 - REPEAT NUISANCE SERVICE-CALL FEE 
 
9.20.010 - Purpose. 
A.  ..... The purpose of this section is to protect the public health, safety, general welfare, and quiet enjoyment of residential property by preventing and abating repeat service-response calls by the City to the same property or location for nuisance, which divert police and other public-safety services from other city residents. It is the intent of the City to impose and collect service-call fees from the owner or occupant, or both, of property to which peace officers or city officers or employees must repeatedly respond to address a nuisance. The repeat nuisance service-call fee imposed by this chapter is intended to cover the excess cost above the cost of providing normal law- or code-enforcement services and police protection citywide. 
B.  ..... The City may enforce this chapter in addition to any other remedy that it has under the Code. Nothing in this chapter precludes concurrent or subsequent enforcement of any other provision of this Code, including, but not limited to those of Titles 3 (finance and revenue), 5 (business licenses and regulations), 8 (health and safety), and 9 (public peace, morals and welfare).

2.  State that, in addition to the city's right to seek other legal remedies or actions for abatement of the nuisance, the owner and occupant may be subject to a repeat nuisance service-call fee if a third nuisance service-call is made to the property within 365 days of the date of the notice; and 
3.  Be served personally on the owner and occupant at the time of the visit or, within five days of the visit, by U.S. mail to the address of the subject property and, if different, to the owner's address of record on the county property-tax rolls. 
(Ord. No. 1617, § 8, 2-16-2016)  
9.20.040 - Repeat Nuisance Service-Call Fee. 
A.  ..... The City shall impose a repeat nuisance service-call fee on both the owner and the occupant of private property if the City has made two or more nuisance service-calls to the property during the preceding 365 days. This fee is in addition to any other fee lawfully imposed under this Code or state or federal law. 
B.  ..... The amount of the repeat nuisance service-call fee shall be set forth by City Council resolution. All repeat nuisance service-call fees imposed and charged against the owner and occupant under this section are deemed delinquent 30 days after the City mails a billing statement to the address of the subject property and, if different, to the owner's address of record on the county property-tax rolls. Delinquent payments are subject to late penalty equal to 10 percent the amount due. 
(Ord. No. 1617, § 8, 2-16-2016)

In the billing statement for an imposed repeat nuisance service-call fee, the City shall inform the owner and occupant of his or her right to a hearing on the alleged repeat nuisance service-calls. The owner or occupant may request a hearing by serving a written request for hearing on the City Clerk within seven calendar days after the statement was mailed. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Section 1.20.080 (Administrative hearing). 
(Ord. No. 1617, § 8, 2-16-2016)  
9.20.060 - Legal Remedies Not Exclusive.

A.  ..... Upon receipt of written waiver application and required fee, the City Manager may waive the requirements of Section 12.08.010 of this chapter when the City Manager finds that any of the following exists: 
1.  Due to location of the property, the terrain or condition of the property or other similar reason, the construction of the curb, gutter and sidewalk would be impractical and/or unnecessary;

If the building construction is subject to discretionary approval and the valuation of building construction improvements meets the criteria in Section 12.08.010(A), then the discretionary approval shall be conditioned to require dedication of right-of-way or an easement(s) for public sidewalk purposes and be required to install new sidewalk or to address existing sidewalk obstructions per Section 12.08.010, unless such condition to require dedication of sufficient right-of-way or easement(s) is waived by the appropriate City approval body. 
D.  ..... There shall be no obligation to install new sidewalk or remove obstructions in existing sidewalk for properties located on private streets. 
E.  ..... The requirement for installation of new sidewalk or repair of existing sidewalk may be partially waived by the City Manager to reduce, but not entirely waive, the amount of new installation or repair required along a property frontage if one (1) or more criteria in 12.08.020(A) are found to apply to a portion of the of property frontage.

The license fee shall consist of the following components: 
1.  Minimum Compensation Component. Each and every licensee which constructs, maintains, and operates a telecommunications system, or any portion thereof, or provides a telecommunications service, which is not exempt in whole from compensation payment requirements pursuant to federal or state law, shall pay minimum compensation (the "minimum compensation requirement") on an annual basis in an amount to be established in the initial license, franchise, permit, or other authorizations. The City Council shall from time to time and by resolution establish the minimum compensation requirement and appropriate inflation factor to be utilized in all licenses, franchises, permits, and other authorizations. The minimum compensation requirement shall not exceed the fair market value of the property rights granted to the licensee, i.e., the privilege of using streets, public rights-of-way, and easements to construct, maintain, and operate a telecommunications system or portion thereof, which are not exempt in their entirety from the imposition of a compensation requirement by applicable federal or state law.

If the City determines that said non-exempt property rights possess a fair market value in excess of the minimum compensation requirement, the City shall engage in negotiations with the licensee, franchisee, or holder of the permit or authorization to provide additional compensation to the City, in cash or in-kind services or facilities, which represents in value the difference between the minimum compensation requirement and the fair market value (the "additional compensation") (the minimum compensation requirement and the additional compensation shall collectively be referred to as the "total compensation"). Under no circumstances shall the total compensation exceed the fair market value of the non-exempt property rights granted to the licensee, franchisee, or holder of the permit or authorization. To the extent that the City and the applicant agree upon total compensation as part of the issuance of the license, franchise, permit, or other authorization, said agreement shall be binding upon the City for the term of the license, franchise, permit, or other authorization. However, to the extent that the parties cannot or do not agree upon said total compensation in the franchise, license, permit, or other authorization, the City Council may, from time to time but no more frequently than annually, establish by resolution the additional compensation and modify said additional compensation based upon changes in the fair market value of the non-exempt property rights granted or conveyed. 
3.  Acceptance by the applicant of any license, franchise, permit, or other authorization shall constitute an acceptance of the minimum compensation requirement unless the applicant can affirmatively demonstrate that all of the activities, both present and future, which will be conducted utilizing the property rights granted to the applicant are completely and totally exempt from all compensation requirements pursuant to applicable federal or state law. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant. The applicant shall provide all written and oral information, documents and evidence reasonably requested by the City which are necessary or relevant to a determination as to whether all of its activities and uses which use or occupy streets, public rights-of-way, and Easements are exempt from non-cost recovery compensation. 
J.  Appeals. An applicant may appeal the denial of a license or a condition imposed in a license to the City Council. Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the City Clerk by 5 p.m. on the tenth (10th) business day following the date of mailing of the City's written decision that is being appealed The appeal shall be accompanied by a fee as established from time to time by resolution of the City Council.

Article III. - Rates and Charges 
 
13.04.220 - Establishment of water rate schedule.

Non-potable rates for the City shall be calculated by adding the fixed rate established in subsection A and the non-potable water consumption rate established in subsection C. 
A.  Fixed Rate . Except as provided below, every customer to whom the City has issued a water meter shall pay a fixed rate based upon the size of the water meter. The fixed rate shall appear on billing statements as the "Water Base Fee". The fixed rate shall be as follows: 
WATER BASE FEE 
Meter Size 	Current Rates 	Rate effective 1/1/2018 	Rate effective 1/1/2019 	Rate effective 1/1/2020 	Rate effective 1/1/2021 	Rate effective 1/1/2022 
1" 	$17.48 	$18.71 	$21.87 	$25.33 	$26.56 	$27.41 
1-1/2" 	$39.31 	$46.17 	$53.97 	$62.49 	$65.53 	$67.72 
2" 	$58.73 	$69.70 	$81.47 	$94.34 	$98.93 	$102.09 
3" 	$114.16 	$144.23 	$168.59 	$195.19 	$204.70 	$211.23 
4" 	$172.45 	$254.07 	$296.96 	$343.83 	$360.58 	$372.08 
6" 	$330.91 	$516.89 	$604.14 	$699.48 	$733.56 	$756.96 
 
B.  Variable Rate - Potable Water . Every customer to whom the City has issued a potable water meter or fire hydrant meter shall pay two variable rates: 1) a consumption-based rate, and 2) a wholesale water supply pass-through rate. Both rates are based upon the units of water consumed and the customer classification. By way of example, if the fixed rate is eighteen dollars and seventy-one cents ($18.71), the uniform City Distribution Charge is one dollar and forty-nine cents ($1.49) per unit, and the water supply charge is two dollars and sixty-eight cents ($2.68) per unit a person in the single-family residential category who uses fifteen (15) units of water during any billing cycle will have a water bill of eighty-one dollars and twenty-six cents ($81.26) ($18.71 [fixed rate] + $22.35 [15 units × $1.49 per unit] + $40.20 [15 units × $2.68 per unit]). 
1.  Distribution Charge (Consumption-based Rate) . In addition to the fixed rate established in subsection A of this section above, every customer for which the City has issued a potable water meter shall also pay a monthly potable water consumption-based rate. The consumption-based rate shall appear on billing statements as the "City Distribution Charge." The phrase "potable water consumption" shall mean all water which has passed through a City potable water meter. The City Distribution Charge imposes a uniform rate per unit of water by customer classification, with one unit equal to one hundred cubic feet ("ccf") or 748 gallons of water. The City Distribution Charge takes into account base costs (including baseline supplies, treatment, distribution, and storage, up to a level that meets the City's baseline demands throughout the year) and peaking costs (i.e., meeting peak, summer water demands, and conservation costs). The potable City Distribution rates are established as follows: 
POTABLE WATER - CONSUMPTION-BASED DISTRIBUTION CHARGE 
All rates at per ccf (hundred cubic feet; 1 ccf = 748 gallons) 
Customer Classification 	Rate effective 1/1/2018 	Rate effective 1/1/2019 	Rate effective 1/1/2020 	Rate effective 1/1/2021 	Rate effective 1/1/2022 
Single-Family Residential 	$1.49 	$1.74 	$2.01 	$2.11 	$2.17 
Multi-Family Residential 	$1.36 	$1.58 	$1.83 	$1.92 	$1.98 
Potable Irrigation 	$1.98 	$2.38 	$2.84 	$2.98 	$3.07 
Commercial 	$1.37 	$1.60 	$1.85 	$1.94 	$2.01 
 
2.  a.  Wholesale Water Supply Pass-through Rate . In addition to the fixed rate established in subsection A and the City Distribution rate established in subsection B(1) above, every customer for which the City has issued a potable water meter shall also pay a pass-through rate for the cost of wholesale water based on potable water consumption. The consumption-based pass-through rate shall appear on billing statements as the "Water Supply Charge". The phrase "potable water consumption" shall mean all water which has passed through a City potable water meter. The pass-through rate imposes a uniform rate per unit of water, with one unit equal to one hundred cubic feet ("ccf") or 748 gallons of water. The pass-through rate is based on the City's current wholesale cost of purchased water supplies. The rate shall be established annually and calculated as follows: 
Pass Through = Total Water Cost/Forecasted Demand 
The 2018 pass-through rate is calculated with the above formula, and information from the City's Fiscal Year 2017-18 adopted budget. (Budgeted purchased water cost of $8.1 million divided by forecasted demand of 6,957 acre feet, divided by 435 to convert to a uniform cost per unit). The pass-through rate effective January 1, 2018 is $2.68. 
b.  Future Pass-through Adjustments . The City shall pass-through to its water service customers any future wholesale water supply charges and any rate increases to any existing wholesale water supply charge, including imported water charges, that are imposed on the City by MWDOC or other wholesale water suppliers. Any increase in the water service fees due to wholesale water supply pass-through adjustments would impact the Water Supply rate. Any increase to the rates as a result of pass-through adjustments shall be imposed effective January 1, 2018, and each year thereafter; provided, however that in no event will the rates be increased in any fiscal year as a result of Pass-through Adjustment by more than the cost of providing water service. 
Pass-through adjustments will be calculated annually, following budget adoption by Council and shall use the total water cost and forecasted demand from the adopted budget to calculate the pass-through rates for the following calendar year. 
C.  Variable Rate - Non-Potable Irrigation Water . In addition to the fixed rates established in subsection A of this section, every owner of property for which the City has issued an irrigation water meter connected to the non-potable water system shall also pay a monthly non-potable irrigation water consumption rate as hereby established. "Non-potable irrigation water consumption" shall mean all water which has flowed through a City non-potable irrigation water meter. The non-potable irrigation water consumption rate shall be based upon the "per unit" cost of non-potable water as multiplied by the quantity of non-potable water consumed. By way of example, if the fixed rate is sixty-nine dollars and seventy cents ($69.70), the uniform non-potable consumption charge is two dollars and sixty-six cents ($2.66) per unit, a non-potable irrigation account which uses one hundred (100) units of water during any billing cycle will have a water bill of three hundred and thirty-five dollars and seventy cents ($335.70) ($69.70 [fixed rate] + $266.00 [100 units x $2.66 per unit]). 
NON-POTABLE IRRIGATION 
All rates at per ccf (hundred cubic feet; 1 ccf = 748 gallons) 
	Current Rate 	Rate effective 1/1/2018 	Rate effective 1/1/2019 	Rate effective 1/1/2020 	Rate effective 1/1/2021 	Rate effective 1/1/2022 
Non-Potable Irrigation 	$2.38 	$2.66 	$2.87 	$3.11 	$3.21 	$3.29 
 
D.  Annual Rate Review . In order to adjust for increased or decreased costs associated with the operation of the City's water system, the City establishes an annual rate review in the manner described below. For purposes of this section, the phrase "operating position" shall mean Water Operating Fund operating revenues minus Water Operating Fund operating expenses. 
Maximum Rates, as defined in subsections A, B(1) and C above, have been established for a five-year period. Each year, in conjunction with the City's Long Term Financial Planning process, the City shall forecast the operating position for the Water Operating Fund for a five-year period, based on known cost increases or decreases and estimates for unknown cost increases or decreases, using inflation factors derived from a credible third party economic forecasting source. Rate adjustments, established in subsections A, B(1), and C may be established at a lesser amount based on the annual rate review performed, provided the recommended rates achieve a neutral operating position over the forecast period. 
E.  Demand Management Rate . In addition to the fixed and consumption-based rates established in subsections A through D above, every owner of property for which the City has issued a water meter shall pay Demand Management rates during periods of decreased water demand, as declared by Council Resolution. The Demand Management Rate(s) will be added to customer bills when the water demand decreases by the percentages below from projected Fiscal Year End 2018 demand. The Demand Management Rates shall consist of a fixed rate, which shall apply when reductions exceed ten percent, and an inclining variable rate, applied to all per unit water consumption. By way of example, if a decreased water demand of 20 percent is adopted by Resolution, then a single-family account, using 15 units of water per month, will see their bill increase by five dollars and twenty-four cents ($5.24) ($0.74 [fixed rate] and $4.50 [15 units × $0.30 per unit]). The Demand Management rates are established as follows:

Chapter 13.28 - WASTE DISCHARGE PRETREATMENT AND SOURCE CONTROL PROGRAM[2] 
Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1544, § 2, adopted December 6, 2011, repealed former Ch. 13.28, and enacted provisions designated as a new Ch. 13.28 to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Ch. 13.28 pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
 
Article I. - General Provisions 
 
13.28.010 - Introduction. 
A.  ..... The City of San Clemente (CSC) is a general law city formed under provisions of the California Government Code in 1928. The CSC provides water and wastewater treatment and disposal services to its residents and commercial customers within the CSC's service area. As part of the South Orange County Wastewater Authority (SOCWA), the CSC owns capacity to provide wastewater disposal through the SOCWA ocean outfall located offshore of the City of Dana Point. 
B.  ..... SOCWA is governed by its own Board of Directors (Board) with each Director representing a member agency (MA). MAs join together in various project committees to construct and operate joint sewerage facilities. The SOCWA ocean outfall is the key facility in the SOCWA system. Treated wastewater is discharged to the outfall from SOCWA, other MAs, and the CSC's wastewater treatment plant. 
C.  ..... SOCWA is the lead agency responsible for the implementation of the provisions contained in the ordinance codified in this chapter. The CSC, a MA of SOCWA, may opt to administer and enforce these provisions under SOCWA's oversight, or may contract with SOCWA to have these services provided to the CSC. An interagency agreement has been adopted between the CSC and SOCWA that defines each agencies' duties and responsibilities. This interagency agreement is on file at both the CSC and SOCWA offices. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.020 - Objectives. 
A.  ..... The objectives of this chapter are to: 
1.  Ensure compliance with various regulatory agencies and certain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements; 
2.  Prevent the introduction of pollutants that may cause interference of sewerage facility operations; 
3.  Identify the goals, objectives and procedures for complying with federal pretreatment standards; 
4.  Prevent biosolids contamination; 
5.  Promote the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters or biosolids from sewerage facilities; 
6.  Encourage waste minimization and material substitution by users. 
7.  Protect sewerage facility employees and the general public who may be affected by wastewater, biosolids and chemical hazards; 
8.  Encourage the reuse, recycling and reduction of water, wastewater or solids that are discharged to sewerage facilities; 
9.  Minimize the discharge of volatile organic compounds that could individually or collectively contribute to a decrease in the quality of air emission from sewerage facilities. 
10.  Establish an effective monitoring program for the control of user discharges to sewerage facilities; 
11.  Establish an enforcement response plan (ERP); 
12.  Equitably allocate costs; 
13.  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into sewerage facilities that may pass through a sewerage facility inadequately treated, into the receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with sewerage facilities; 
14.  Incorporate the necessary laws and regulations in order to implement and enforce federal, State of California (State), CSC and SOCWA standards; 
15.  Seek to identify users that discharge or have the potential to discharge toxic pollutants, non-compatible or excessive amounts of compatible wastes to sewerage facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.030 - Purpose. 
A.  ..... The purpose of this chapter is to: 
1.  Provide for the maximum public benefit from the use of CSC and/or SOCWA sewerage facilities. This is accomplished by regulating the use of sewerage facilities and wastewater discharges by providing equitable distribution of costs in compliance with applicable State and federal regulations and by providing procedures that will allow the CSC and/or SOCWA to comply with requirements placed upon them by other regulatory agencies. Any revenues derived from the application of this chapter may be used to recover the cost of providing services by the CSC and/or SOCWA, which include but are not limited to administration, monitoring, and enforcement. 
2.  Comply with federal and State regulations which allow the CSC and/or SOCWA to meet applicable standards for the final effluent and ocean outfall quality. This chapter establishes quality and quantity limitations on all wastewater discharges whether or not the discharges adversely affect the CSC's and/or SOCWA's sewerage facilities, processes, ocean outfall effluent quality, or inhibit the CSC's and/or SOCWA's ability to meet its specific discharge limitations. It is the intent of this chapter to improve the quality of wastewater being received for treatment and to encourage water conservation by all users connected to a sewerage facility. It is the CSC's and/or SOCWA's intent to discourage the increase in quantity (mass emission) of waste constituents being discharged. This chapter also imposes pretreatment requirements on the degree of waste authorized to be discharged to the CSC's and/or SOCWA's sewerage facilities, provides for the issuance of wastewater discharge permits or other controlling mechanism to impose additional case-by-case requirements, as appropriate, and establishes fees and other penalties for noncompliance and for violations of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.040 - Policy. 
A.  ..... The policy of this chapter is to be: 
1.  Interpreted in accordance with the definitions set forth in this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the discharge of all wastes carried to CSC's and/or SOCWA's sewerage facilities, and are to be liberally construed so as to effectuate the environmental purposes, objectives, and other provisions set forth herein. 
2.  Committed to wastewater reclamation and reuse in order to provide an alternate source of water supply. The adoption of programs for reclamation through secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment processes may necessitate more stringent quality requirements on wastewater discharges. In the event that more stringent quality requirements are necessary, this chapter may be amended to reflect those changes. 
3.  Committed to the beneficial use of biosolids. The implementation of programs to land apply or provide for the marketing and distribution of biosolids may necessitate more stringent quality requirements on wastewater discharges. In the event that more stringent quality requirements are necessary, this chapter may be amended to reflect such changes. 
4.  Committed to complying with all applicable federal and State laws including the Clean Water Act in 33 United States Code 1251 et seq. and the general pretreatment regulations described in 40 CFR 403. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.050 - Applicability. 
This chapter may apply to users within the CSC and/or SOCWA service area and to users outside the CSC and/or SOCWA service area who, by wastewater discharge permit or other control mechanism, make use of CSC and/or SOCWA sewerage facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.060 - Availability of sewage facilities. 
If capacity in sewerage facilities as a whole is not available, the CSC and/or SOCWA may restrict discharge of existing users until sufficient capacity can be made available. The CSC and/or SOCWA may refuse immediate service to new users where their proposed quality or quantity of wastewater is unacceptable to the available sewerage facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.070 - Notices to discharger's employees. 
A.  ..... The CSC and/or SOCWA may provide one (1) copy of this chapter to each user that has received a wastewater discharge permit, upon request. 
B.  ..... Users who are issued a wastewater discharge permit may make available to their employees copies of this chapter. 
C.  ..... Users who are issued a wastewater discharge permit may make copies of it so as to make it available to all personnel at all times. 
D.  ..... A notice may be permanently posted in prominent places advising employees to call the CSC and/or SOCWA in the event of an uncontrolled spill or discharge as soon as possible and to submit a report as required by this chapter. The notice shall provide for necessary instruction and information, including but not limited to: 
1.  CSC and SOCWA phone numbers. 
2.  Recording the time of the incident.

13.28.700 - Notification of changed discharge. 
All users that have been issued a wastewater discharge permit shall notify the CSC in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(j). 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.702 - Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste (40 CFR 403 12(p)(1)). 
A.  ..... The industrial user shall notify the CSC, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into sewerage facilities of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to sewerage facilities, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after a discharge to sewerage facilities commences. Any notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under Section 13.28.700 of this chapter and as listed in 40 CFR 403 12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections 13.28.620, 13.28.640 and 13.28.650 of this ordinance and as listed in 40 CFR 403 12(b), (d), and (e). 
B.  ..... Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Section 13.28.702A. above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261 30(d) and 261 33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
C.  ..... In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the CSC, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
D.  ..... In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
E.  ..... This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(Ord. No. 1621, § 2, 4-19-2016)  
Article IX. - Enforcement 
 
13.28.710 - Enforcement scope. 
A.  ..... The CSC finds that in order for it to comply with the laws, regulations, and rules imposed upon it by regulatory agencies and to ensure that sewerage facilities and treatment processes are protected and are able to operate with the highest efficiency; specific enforcement provisions must be adopted to regulate discharges from industrial users. 
B.  ..... The CSC is willing to cooperate with all users on improvements in wastewater quality, yet must be in a position to ensure that uncooperative users shall comply with this chapter and any conditions set forth in a wastewater discharge permit. 
C.  ..... The CSC intends to ensure that all interested parties are afforded due process of law and that any noncompliance or violation is resolved as soon as possible. 
D.  ..... All users have a right of appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
E.  ..... Each noncompliance or violation per day and each day of noncompliance or violation shall be taken as a separate noncompliance or violation for determining the amount of fees, charges, fines or penalties and/or which enforcement actions may be taken. A violation of a weekly average is considered seven (7) days of violation for that parameter and a violation of a monthly average is based upon the number of days in that month. A violation of multiple parameters caused by a single operational upset is considered one (1) violation. 
F.  ..... The issuance of exercise of any type of an enforcement action provided for under this chapter shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other or additional enforcement action against a user under this chapter or any other local, state or federal law. The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive and the CSC is empowered to take more then one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.720 - Notice of noncompliance (NON) 
A.  ..... In the event that it is determined that a user is in noncompliance with any provision of this chapter, or the terms, conditions and limitations of its wastewater discharge permit, the CSC may issue a NON form, whereby the user shall comply with all directives, conditions and requirements therein within the time prescribed. 
B.  ..... The issuance of a NON form may contain terms and conditions including, but not limited to, installation of pretreatment equipment, sampling structures, submittal of drawings or technical reports, payment of fees or administrative fines, limits on rate and time of discharge or any other provisions to ensure compliance with this chapter and the user's wastewater discharge permit. This action is not a prerequisite to taking other or more severe enforcement actions. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.730 - Notice of violation (NOV) 
A.  ..... In the event that it is determined that a user has not responded to a NON form that was previously issued to them or that noncompliance of any pretreatment standards requires their immediate attention, the CSC may issue a NOV form, whereby the user shall comply with all directives, conditions and requirements therein within the time prescribed. 
B.  ..... The issuance of a NOV form may contain terms and conditions including, but not limited to, installation of pretreatment equipment, sampling structures, submittal of drawings or technical reports, payment of fees, administrative fines, limits on rate and time of discharge or any other provisions to ensure compliance with this chapter. This action in not a prerequisite to taking other or more severe enforcement actions. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)  
13.28.740 - Administrative order (AO). 
A.  ..... The AO is an enforcement document from the CSC directing the noncompliant user to undertake or to cease specific activities required to bring the user into compliance with this chapter or the terms, conditions and limitation of a wastewater discharge permit as determined by the CSC. The terms and conditions of the AO are not negotiable by the user. The circumstances of a user's noncompliance will be considered in determining the terms of the AO necessary to achieve the earliest possible return to compliance by the user. AOs may include administrative complaints. Types of AOs may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Probation Order (PO). The PO directs the noncompliant user to achieve compliance by a date specified in the order. The PO is usually issued when a user is in non-compliance of this chapter, or the terms, conditions and limitations of its wastewater discharge permit or other enforcement action, or has not made payment of all amounts owed to the CSC which include, but are not limited to, any fees, charges, fines and/or penalties. This action is not a prerequisite to taking other or more severe enforcement actions. 
2.  Show Cause Order (SCO). The SCO directs the noncompliant user to appear at a formal meeting, usually at a CSC location, to explain its noncompliance, and to show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not go forward. This action is not a prerequisite to taking other or more severe enforcement actions. 
3.  Cease and Desist Order (CDO). The CDO directs the noncompliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately, or to terminate its discharge altogether. A CDO may be issued in situations where a particular discharge could cause interference or pass through, or threaten human safety or the environment. The CDO may be issued immediately upon discovery of the problem. In an emergency, a CDO may be issued by any means; however, such an order should be followed by a written CDO on the user. If necessary, the CSC may order immediate cessation of any discharge to a sewerage facility, regardless of the user's compliance status. If a user fails to comply with the CDO, the CSC may take any independent action to halt the discharge. This action is not a prerequisite to taking other or more severe enforcement actions. 
(Ord. No. 1544, § 2, 12-6-2011)

Chapter 13.32 - STORM DRAINAGE FEE PROGRAM 
 
13.32.010 - Purpose. 
In order to provide for the safety of the residents of the City and protect property in the City from the damages associated with flooding, it is necessary to design, construct, operate, maintain, improve and replace storm drainage facilities which will collect storm and surface water runoff and channel such runoff in a safe manner. In order to properly fund such facilities, the City Council has determined that it is necessary to impose on developed property and undeveloped, graded property a stormwater drainage fee (the "fee"). The City Council finds that the fee, as established below, is reasonably related to the costs of providing storm drainage facilities services. 
(Ord. 1120 § 1 (A(part)), 1993)  
13.32.020 - Definitions. 
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the ascribed meanings: 
"Assessee" shall mean the person obligated to pay the fee. 
"City" shall mean the City of San Clemente. 
"Developed parcel" shall mean any lot or parcel of land which has been altered from its natural state by the construction, creation or addition of impervious area, except public streets and highways. 
"Engineer" shall mean the Utilities Director of the City of San Clemente or his or her designee. 
"Equivalent drainage residential unit (DRU)" shall mean the basic unit for the computation of the fee, and is based upon the average amount of impervious area of a single-family residential parcel. 
"Impervious area" shall mean any part of any parcel that has been modified by the action of any person in a manner which reduces the land's natural ability to absorb and hold storm and surface water. This includes the grading of the property and/or creation of any hard surface area which either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle, and/or the hardening of an existing surface which causes water to flow at an increased rate. By way of example, common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, walkways, patios, driveways parking lots or storage areas, concrete or asphalt paving, gravel, roads, or any cleared, graded, paved, graveled or compacted surface or paved earthen materials, or areas covered with surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of surface water into the soil mantle. 
"Multifamily residential property" shall mean all residentially zoned, developed parcels containing two (2) or more dwelling units. This includes apartments, condominiums, timeshares, hotels and motels. 
"Nonresidential property" shall mean all developed parcels zoned or used for commercial, industrial, retail, governmental or institutional uses. 
"Parcel" shall mean the smallest separately segregated lot, unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries and surface area which is documented for property tax purposes and given an Assessors' parcel number by the Orange County Assessor. 
"Single-family residential property" shall include all developed parcels with one (1) single-family detached housing unit. 
"Storm and surface water" shall mean water occurring on the surface of the land from natural conditions such as rainfall, regardless of whether such water is falling or flowing onto land in question. 
"Storm and surface water control facilities" shall mean all manmade structures or natural watercourse facility improvements, developments, properties or interest therein, which are or have been made, constructed or acquired for the conveyance of storm and surface water runoff to improve the quality of controlling or protecting life or property from any storm, flood or surplus waters. 
"Storm drainage facilities" shall mean the storm and surface water drainage systems comprised of storm and surface water control facilities and any other natural features which store, control, treat and/or convey storm and surface water. Storm drainage facilities shall include all natural and manmade elements used to convey stormwater from the first point of impact with the surface of the earth to a suitable receiving body of water or location internal or external to the boundaries of the City. Storm drainage facilities include all pipes, appurtenant features, culverts, streets, curbs, gutters, pumping stations, channels, streams, ditches, wetlands, detention/retention basins, ponds and other storm and surface water conveyance and treatment facilities, whether public or private. 
"Undeveloped, graded parcel" shall mean parcels which have been altered, in whole or in part, through a process of clearing, grading or earth moving and compaction so as to alter the perviousness of the parcel, thereby increasing storm and surface water runoff. 
"Undeveloped parcel" shall mean any parcel which has not been altered from its natural state either by grading, or the construction, creation or addition of impervious area, or has been restored to its natural state of perviousness through planting or landscaping, as determined by the engineer. 
(Ord. 1120 § 1 (A(part)), 1993; Ord. No. 1648 , § 6, 12-5-2017)  
13.32.030 - FeeImposition. 
There is imposed on each and every developed parcel and each and every undeveloped, graded parcel within the City and the owner and occupiers thereof, jointly and severally, the City of San Clemente storm drainage fee (the "fee"). The fee is found to be reasonably related to the cost of providing storm drainage facility services for the parcels assessed the fee. The fee is reasonable and is necessary to pay for: (1) improving the quality of storm and surface water; and (2) the design, construction, operation, maintenance, improvement and replacement of the City's storm drainage facilities.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1667 , § 2, adopted Jan. 15, 2019, amended Ch. 13.40, §§ 13.40.01013.40.180, in effect repealing and reenacting said chapter as set out herein. Former Ch. 13.40 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1530, § 1, adopted Dec. 7, 2010 and Ord. No. 1648, § 8, adopted Dec. 5, 2017. 
 
13.40.010 - Authority. 
The Clean Water Act (33 USC Section 1251 et seq., as amended, including Section 402(p) therein) and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Cal. Water Code § 13000 et seq., as amended) mandate, in part, that municipalities operating municipal separate storm sewer systems obtain permits to effectively prohibit non-stormwater discharges into the city's storm sewers and to reduce the discharge of pollutants. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has authorized the State of California through the State Water Resources Control Board and its regional water quality control boards to control non-point source and point source discharges to California's waterways. The San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board addresses the obligation to implement the Clean Water Act by periodically issuing combined National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits and Waste Discharge Requirements (WDRs) to the County of Orange, Orange County Flood Control District, and the incorporated cities of Orange County within its jurisdiction. The City of San Clemente is named as a co-permittee under this combined NPDES permit and WDRs and must comply with the requirements set forth therein. 
Pursuant to Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution, which authorizes the city to exercise the police power of the state by adopting regulations promoting the public health, public safety and general prosperity, and in compliance with the conditions of the City's NPDES permit, there is hereby adopted a water quality ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1667 , § 2, 1-15-2019)  
13.40.020 - Purpose and Intent. 
The purpose of this chapter is to protect health and safety, and promote the welfare of the community by:

1.  Compliance with Section 13.40.070 of this chapter, Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) requirements. 
2.  The owner or applicant of a PDP must install and implement BMPs in accordance with the requirements of this chapter prior to receiving final approval of the project or as otherwise specified in the conditions of approval, including the following: 
(a)  All PDPs must be designed, constructed, and maintained to employ post-construction BMPs consistent with the DAMP and JRMP, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(i)  Low impact development BMPs designed to retain (intercept, store, infiltrate, evaporate, and evapotranspire) onsite the pollutants contained in the volume of stormwater runoff produced from a 24-hour 85th percentile storm event (design capture volume). If the applicant demonstrates, to the Director's satisfaction, that onsite retention is not technically feasible, biofiltration or flow-thru BMPs may be used in accordance with the following: 
I.  Biofiltration BMPs must be designed to have an appropriate hydraulic loading rate to maximize stormwater retention and pollutant removal; prevent erosion, scour, and channeling within the BMP; and be sized to treat 1.5 times the design capture volume not reliably retained onsite. 
II.  If biofiltration BMPs are not technically feasible, flow-thru treatment control BMPs may be used; provided however, that such BMPs must treat the design capture volume not reliably retained onsite and must be sized and designed in accordance with the requirements of the NPDES permit, DAMP and JRMP. 
(ii)  Hydromodification management BMPs that are sized and designed such that post-project runoff conditions (flow rates and durations) will not exceed the pre-development runoff conditions by more than 10 percent (for the range of flows that result in increased potential for erosion or degraded instream habitat downstream of the Priority Development Project). A PDP may be exempt from the hydromodification management BMP requirements in this subsection, at the discretion of the Director, where the project discharges water to any of the following: existing underground storm drains that discharge directly to water storage reservoirs, lakes, enclosed embayments, or the Pacific Ocean; conveyance channels whose bed and bank are concrete lined from the point of discharge to the water storage reservoir, lake, enclosed embayment, or the Pacific Ocean; or an area the City deems appropriate for an exemption pursuant to any watershed management area analysis incorporated into an applicable water quality improvement plan accepted by the Regional Board. 
3.  All PDPs must avoid critical course sediment yield areas identified by the City or in any watershed management area analysis accepted by the Regional Board unless measures are implemented that allow for no net impact from critical coarse sediment to the receiving water and comply with the DAMP and JRMP. 
4.  As a condition of development, the owner of a PDP must, prior to occupancy of the development, enter into an agreement for maintenance of any BMPs with the City. The agreement must be recorded to run with the land and be binding upon the owner, heirs, and successors in interest to the project and to any real property developed in conjunction with the project in perpetuity. The agreement must include an annual requirement that verification of the effective operation and maintenance of each approved BMP be conducted by the owner. Maintenance must be performed by the owner and certified to the City prior to each rainy season. The agreement must also include a right of entry on the part of the City for the purpose of inspecting and confirming the condition of permanent BMPs and to perform maintenance or repairs where operation and maintenance is not conducted in a proper or timely fashion. 
C.  ..... The project applicant must provide for and submit proof of the ongoing long-term maintenance of all BMPs. Compliance with the requirements of the DAMP and JRMP does not exempt any person from the requirement to independently comply with each provision of this chapter. 
D.  ..... The project applicant must reimburse the City for all costs and expenses incurred by the planning agency in the review of new development or redevelopment projects for compliance with the DAMP and JRMP. The Director may elect to require a deposit of estimated costs and expenses, and the actual costs and expenses will be deducted from the deposit, and the balance, if any, refunded to the project applicant.

15.04.070 - Site stability requirements. 
A.  ..... The building official shall not issue a permit for: 
1.  the construction of a new building or structure, 
2.  the placement of a new building or structure on a permanent foundation, 
3.  the alteration of or any addition to an existing building that increases the square footage of interior space, 
4.  the construction or alteration of any structure intended to increase the stability of any land or existing building, or 
5.  the alteration of an existing building or structure in a way that reduces the stability of the land upon which the building or structure is located 
unless, the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the building official that the land beneath and in the immediate vicinity of the building or structure upon which the development is proposed will, after the work for which a permit is sought, meet either (B)(1) or (B)(2), below. The building official may waive this requirement for trellises, wooden fences, glass windscreens, decks less than 50 square feet in area, flag poles and similar minor structures. 
B.  .....   
1.  The minimum stability requirements stated in the San Clemente Grading Manual, Appendix F (i.e., a factor of safety on shear strength of at least 1.5 for static loads and 1.1 for pseudostatic loads) (herein, the "Minimum Factor of Safety"), or 
2.  Alternative stability requirements as may be approved by the City Engineer.

(Ord. No. 1527, § 1, 12-7-2010) 
Editor's note It should be noted that § 2 of Ord. No. 1527, adopted December 7, 2010, provides "New section 15.04.070 is being added to Chapter 15.04 of the San Clemente Municipal Code ("Administrative Provisions") to better define when a building permit will not be issued for construction of a new building or structure, an addition or alteration that increases the interior square footage of an existing building, or an alteration of an existing building in a way that reduces the stability of the land upon which the building or structure is located. This code addition is made due to the general findings listed below: 
I. Topographical conditions: 
A. Natural slopes of 15 percent or greater generally occur throughout the City. The elevation change caused by the hills creates the geological foundation on which communities within the City are built and will continue to be built. With much of the populated flatlands within the City already built upon, a higher proportion of future growth is likely to be proposed and occur on steeper slopes with greater constraints in terrain. 
II. Geological conditions: 
A. The City is a densely populated area that has buildings constructed over and/or near a vast and complex network of faults that are believed to be capable of producing future earthquakes similar or greater in size than the 1994 Northridge and the 1971 Sylmar earthquakes. Earthquake faults run along the northeast and southwest boundaries of Orange County. The Newport-Inglewood Fault, located within Orange County, was the source of the destructive 1933 Long Beach earthquake (6.3 magnitude) which took 120 lives and damaged buildings in an area that ran from Laguna Beach to Marina del Rey to Whittier. In December 1989, another earthquake occurred in the City of Irvine at an unknown fault line. Regional planning for earthquakes is recommended by the State of California, Department of Conservation. 
B. Road circulation features located throughout the City also make these amendments reasonably necessary. There are major roadways, highways and flood control channels that create barriers and slow response times. Hills, slopes, and street and storm drain design accompanied by occasional heavy rainfall cause roadway flooding and landslides and at times may make an emergency access route impassable. 
C. Expansive soils throughout the City combined with predominant hillside conditions, ancient landslides, groundwater and occasional flooding raise the potential for ground slippage, ground erosion, slope failure, and building damage.

The deposit amount shall not be more than twice the permit fee. 
P.  A new Subsection R109.5 is hereby added to Section R109 to read in its entirety as follows: 
R109.5 Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which an inspection is requested is not complete or when previous corrections are not corrected. 
This subsection is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection. 
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or otherwise made available on the work site, or when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, or for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested. 
To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall pay the reinspection fee as established by the City Council Fee Resolution. In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of work will be performed until the required reinspection fees have been paid.

Chapter 15.40 - HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT 
 
15.40.010 - Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code amendedHillside development. 
Chapter 70 of the Uniform Building Code is further amended by adding the Hillside Development Regulations (to be known and cited as the "City of San Clemente Hillside Development Ordinance") to read as follows in Sections 15.40.020 through 15.40.080 of this chapter. 
(Prior code § 27A-42)  
15.40.020 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of the Hillside Development Regulations is to implement the goals, objectives and policies of the general plan, including the Land Use Element, the Conservation and Open Space Element, and the Seismic Safety Element relating to the preservation and maintenance of the natural character and amenities of hillsides as a scenic resource of the City and relating to protection from geologic hazards regarding unstable soils, prevention of erosion and the like. 
(Prior code § 27A-43)  
15.40.030 - Applicability. 
A.  ..... The provisions of the Hillside Development Regulations shall apply to all areas located within the development (D-D) district as established by the City Zoning Ordinance, and to all areas within the D-D district for which specific plans have been approved, except these regulations do not apply to that portion of the D-D district which is designated as the development district coastal (D-C) on the General Plan Land Use Element Map. 
B.  ..... The Hillside Development Regulations are primarily intended for application in connection with the site plan review process. However, certain regulations are identified for application in connection with the specific plan process or the tentative subdivision map process. Refer to Sections 4.296.3 and 4.298.3.1.2.4 of the Zoning Ordinance for applicability to the Hillside Development Ordinance1 regarding specific plans and site plan review, respectively. Approval of a specific plan, tentative subdivision map, or site plan, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, shall constitute a final approval of the development's conformity to the requirements of the Hillside Development Ordinance relating to such approval. 
(Prior code § 27A-44)  
15.40.040 - Definitions. 
A.  ..... Primary ridgelines are those natural preservation ridgelines designated as such on the City General Plan Open Space/Conservation Map. These ridgelines possess the greatest prominent public visibility from existing and undeveloped portions of the City. These ridgelines shall be preserved in their natural state as a means of maintaining community character. Exceptions shall be granted only to accommodate General Plan designated trails, General Plan designated circulation components, viewpoints, fuel modification measures, or other requirements needed to implement the goals and objectives of the general plan, or to meet the provisions of public health, safety and welfare. 
B.  ..... Secondary ridgelines are those ridgelines designated as such on the City General Plan Open Space/Conservation Map. These ridgelines possess a significant amount of public visibility, but are less prominent than primary ridgelines. 
(Prior code § 27A-45)  
15.40.050 - Considerations. 
A.  View and the Viewer. 
1.  Hillside development is more visible than flatland (level terrain) development. Therefore, the Hillside Development Regulations are designed to make hillside development as visually pleasing as possible. 
2.  Panoramic views from hillside roads and public places are as important to the character and amenities of the community as views facing the hillside development. The provision for view opportunities for all residents and visitors plays an important role in creating a positive character for hillside communities. 
B.  Camouflage. 
1.  Quality hillside development blends manmade and man-introduced factors with the natural environment. Therefore, architecture and landscape shall be harmoniously integrated into the natural environment. (See Exhibit A in appendix to this chapter.) 
2.  Compatible architecture responds to the natural environment, incorporating sloped terrain into development rather than eliminating such terrain. Therefore, the scale, form and surface expression of architecture shall either blend with or complement the character and textures of the hillside. 
3.  Compatible landscape, like architecture, responds to the natural environment. Vegetation shall be compatible with and responsive to the environmental conditions of the development site. Therefore, vegetation planted within a developed area creates the theme and character of the community and shall blend and unify the architecture. 
C.  Compression. ..... Conforming to the gradient of a slope forces development into a more vertical living environment. Such compression limits the utilization of many flatland development concepts. Compact development shall be maintained through methods such as clustering and minimizing setbacks, thereby minimizing grading and making development less obtrusive. 
D.  Diversity. 
1.  Diversity in design solutions adds the characteristic of variety to hillside development. Meandering streets conforming to the topography, varied setbacks of homes, and individual solutions to traversing slopes, qualities not found in most flatland development, shall be incorporated in hillside development. 
2.  Uniform stair-stepping of building pads shall be prohibited. (See Exhibit B in appendix to this chapter.) 
E.  Accent and Image. ..... Attention shall be concentrated on significant visual and environment elements, including but not limited to primary and secondary ridgelines, significant vegetation and wildlife habitat, ravines, steep slopes, and important historical or cultural manmade features. Such elements collectively express hillside character. Therefore, preservation or restoration of these elements shall be comprehensively integrated with the hillside development plan. 
(Prior code § 27A-46)  
15.40.060 - Goals. 
A.  ..... The natural topographic character of hillsides as exhibited in ridgeline silhouette and backdrop for development, rounded hill form and angled hillside slopes shall be maintained and/or reinforced. (See Exhibit C in appendix to this chapter.) 
B.  ..... Significant natural systems and resources associated with hillside environments, including but not limited to primary and secondary ridgelines, significant vegetation and wildlife habitat, special geological features, natural drainage swales and canyons, steep slopes, and important historic or cultural manmade features, shall be maintained and/or restored. 
C.  ..... The visual character of hillsides shall be maintained, recognizing both the importance of the exposure of hillside development to off-site public views and the importance of providing panoramic views from the hillside. 
(Prior code § 27A-47)  
15.40.070 - Development requirements. 
A.  Site Planning. 
1.  Project Layout. 
a.  Generally, minimizing required setbacks, especially front and rear setbacks, may reduce grading requirements by reducing the overall width of road and structure arrangements. Reduced setbacks also help to give the streetscope a more human scale. (See Exhibit D in appendix to this chapter.) However, before applying reduced setbacks to a structure, it shall be demonstrated that grading will be reduced, while still providing for useful private space as part of the site. (See Exhibit E in appendix to this chapter.) Varying the use of reduced and standard setbacks will allow the flexibility to adapt to hillside features and avoid monotonous application of a consistent standard. (See Exhibit F in appendix to this chapter.) 
b.  Lot lines shall be placed at the top of major slope areas within public view corridors to help ensure that the slope will not be neglected by the uphill owner. (See Exhibit G in appendix to this chapter.) 
c.  No tentative subdivision map shall be approved unless said map provides for the minimization of grading impacts and flexibility in siting structures and circulation, such as providing for low density and large lots or for higher density and clustered development. 
d.  No tentative subdivision map shall be approved unless said map provides for documentation (including, but not limited to, photographs, sketches, and renderings) relating to ridgeline preservation and recontouring (pursuant to subsections (A)(3)(a) and (A)(3)(b) of this section) through visual analysis as deemed necessary by the City. 
2.  Land Controls. 
a.  An approved tentative subdivision map shall require that all areas of open space exposed to public view or major sloped area shall be developed and maintained in a consistent manner, and that such lands be owned in common by a homeowner's association and developed and maintained as set forth in a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions. (See Exhibit H in appendix to this chapter.) 
b.  Before a tentative subdivision map is approved, major open spaces and natural features of City-wide significance shall be considered for public ownership. Any such land acquired shall allow access for maintenance and emergency purposes. 
3.  Resource Preservation. 
a.  The specific plan for a hillside development shall provide for the natural preservation of primary ridgelines, protecting them from development impacts, and maintaining a backdrop for development. Significant views of the natural ridge silhouette shall be maintained from elements of the general circulation plan and other public open spaces, especially scenic highways. Proposed structures shall not project above the ridge silhouette as visible from City-designated viewpoints. The ridge's natural contours and vegetation shall remain intact with development maintaining an undisturbed minimum horizontal setback of four hundred (400) feet in width with a minimum of two hundred (200) feet in width from the center of the ridgeline to the undisturbed setback line. Lesser setback distances may be authorized at the discretion of the City Council if it can be demonstrated that the objectives of this setback will be achieved, and that in any case no units would be located in that setback. (See Exhibit I in appendix to this chapter.) 
b.  The specific plan for a hillside development shall further provide for the conditional preservation of secondary ridgelines. Permitted recontouring of a ridgeline shall result in a rounded appearance so as to resemble natural terrain, providing a backdrop for development. Recontouring shall be permitted in order to accommodate grading operations, circulation impacts, public health and safety, and the like; however, no excessive, flat-planed reconstruction of roads, structures or landforms shall be allowed. (See Exhibit J in appendix to this chapter.) Proposed structures shall not project above the ridge silhouette as visible from City-designated viewpoints. The ridge's natural or manufactured contours and vegetation shall be separated from structures by a minimum horizontal setback of one hundred (100) feet in width with a minimum of fifty (50) feet in width from the center of the ridgeline to the setback line. (See Exhibit K in appendix to this chapter.) 
c.  The specific plan for a hillside development shall further provide for the protection of rock outcrops or geologic features as natural amenities when such outcrops or features are identified on the City General Plan Open Space/Conservation Map. Said resources shall be incorporated into development and public views of them shall be maintained. 
d.  Development setback in drainage swales. All watersheds exceeding ten (10) acres shall be considered major watersheds and shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine development setback requirements. When the applicable specific plan requires the retention of natural or recontoured drainage swales, no tentative subdivision map shall be approved without a hydrologic analysis to determine an adequate setback for preservation of natural or recontoured swales, public safety and riparian vegetation and wildlife (if any). 
4.  Slope Placement. 
a.  Design and placement of structures shall respond to both the cross-sectional slope and the silhouette contour of the hillsides. A majority of the roof pitches shall generally be placed to angle with the slope. However, variation shall be provided to avoid a consistently monotonous application. Collective mass roof lines shall reflect the naturally occurring ridgeline silhouettes and topographical variation, or create an overall variety, that blends with the hillside. (See Exhibit L in appendix to this chapter.) 
b.  On ridgelines not designated as primary or secondary, and used for continuous development along the ridge top, collective roof lines shall be kept low in profile, and the natural silhouette of the ridge shall be repeated with smooth transitions in height from building to building. Consideration of this ridgeline treatment may take landscape features into account. (See Exhibit M in appendix to this chapter.) 
c.  Taller structures which better utilize an uphill placement, because of the setback from the downslope edge provided by the road right-of-way, shall be considered. (See Exhibit N in appendix to this chapter.) 
d.  Downhill placement shall minimize front yard setback to reduce building mass hanging over the slope. Private rear yard space can be provided with a small yard, terrace or deck. Architecture shall step back with the slope. (See Exhibit O in appendix to this chapter.) 
5.  Slope Maintenance. 
a.  No tentative subdivision map shall be approved unless conditioned upon the preparation and recordation of a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions providing for the development and maintenance of slopes as required by the Hillside Development Regulations. 
b.  No tentative subdivision map shall be approved unless conditioned upon the subdivider's supplying a program and/or staff for preventative maintenance of major manufactured slope areas. Such program shall be approved prior to approval of a final map and shall include homeowner slope maintenance requirements and guidelines to be incorporated into the declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions. Every grading permit issued shall be conditioned upon the owner's ten (10) year warranty of all manufactured slopes. 
6.  Grading Standards. 
a.  The following factors shall be taken into consideration prior to the approval of a tentative subdivision map: 
i.  When space and proper drainage requirements can be met with approval by the City Engineer, rounding of slope tops and bottoms shall be accomplished. 
ii.  When slopes cannot be rounded, vegetation shall be used to alleviate the sharp, angular appearance. 
iii.  A rounded and smooth transition shall be made when the planes of man-made and natural slopes intersect. (See Exhibit P in appendix to this chapter.) 
iv.  When significant landforms are sliced for construction, the landforms shall be rounded as much as possible to blend into natural grade. (See Exhibit P in appendix to this chapter.) 
v.  When the established alignment of a road does not conform to the natural contours of slopes, excessively long stretches of manufactured straight embankments shall not be permitted; rather the undulation of embankment slopes shall be provided. (See Exhibit Q in appendix to this chapter.) Manufactured slope faces shall be varied to avoid excessive flat-planed surfaces. (See Exhibit Q in appendix to this chapter.) 
b.  No tentative subdivision map shall be approved unless said map provides that grading operations which affect secondary ridgelines shall leave a portion of the landform intact and shall achieve a smooth, rounded appearance after recontouring. The natural rounded form and silhouette shall be recognizable from both sides of the ridge, providing a backdrop, and remain visible above any structures placed adjacent to the ridge. Use of plant materials to enhance a silhouette is optional depending on natural vegetative cover. (See Exhibit R in appendix to this chapter.) 
B.  Circulation. 
1.  General Layout. 
a.  The following factors shall be taken into consideration prior to the approval of a tentative subdivision map: 
i.  Circulation shall be aligned to conform to the natural grades as much as possible. Long stretches of straight road shall be avoided by utilizing gentle horizontal and vertical curves. 
ii.  Roads that run either directly parallel or perpendicular to the slope shall be avoided in order to reduce grading and to aid in drainage. 
iii.  Bridges shall be considered for roads crossing drainage ways and ravines of exceptional environmental setting to eliminate excess fill when structural requirements do not negate the intent of environmental preservation. 
iv.  Proper sight distances shall be maintained; and, with approval by the City Engineer, three (3) way intersections at angles at less than ninety (90) degrees shall be considered to reduce grading requirements. 
b.  Pedestrian circulation traversing manmade slopes can be provided in the benches; on low slopes, vertical shortcuts can be developed with steps. 
c.  Opportunities shall be created for public views from roadways and public open space by selective placement of structures at key locations. (See Exhibit S in appendix to this chapter.) 
d.  Offstreet parking shall be provided for in a flexible way. Parallel parking can be eliminated to reduce road width in critical areas and then provided for in offstreet bays at more suitable locations. (See Exhibit T in appendix to this chapter.) 
e.  Common drives in single-family developments shall be considered if grading is reduced by their use. 
2.  Roadway Sections. 
a.  When provided, parallel parking shall be located on one (1) side only and be limited to eight (8) feet in width. 
b.  The following factors shall be taken into consideration prior to the approval of a tentative subdivision map: 
i.  Road sections shall meet appropriate standards for hillside roads as found in the City Subdivision Ordinance or adopted specific plans, subject to the approval of the City Engineer. 
ii.  Four (4) foot walkways shall be located directly adjacent to the curb on one (1) or both sides as needed for adequate pedestrian circulation. 
iii.  All utilities shall be located underground, when possible in a common trench in the parkway or under the sidewalk. 
iv.  When placement of roads near ridges and on slopes is proposed, acceptable placements shall include a split roadway section to accommodate grade, knob removal to accommodate views from the road, and the rounding off of cut slopes to enhance appearance. (See Exhibit U in appendix to this chapter.) 
C.  Architectural Standards. 
1.  Building Form. 
a.  Structures shall be designed to minimize creation of flat pads. Single-family units shall be compact and split-level if possible. Multifamily units can be designed with two (2) stories upslope and three (3) stories downslope. 
b.  Building forms shall be scaled to the particular environmental setting so as to complement the hillside character and to avoid excessively massive forms that fail to enhance the hillside character. Building facades shall change plans or use overhangs as a means to create changing shadow lines to further break up massive forms. 
c.  Roof lines shall relate to the slope and topography. Totally flat roof lines shall be avoided. 
2.  Building Exteriors. 
a.  Colors of the building shall be selected to blend with the natural colors and hues of the surrounding hillsides. A color palette shall include white, browns, greens or other earth tones. 
b.  Reflective coatings such as chrome or glass and bright colors shall be used only if demonstrated that structures will not become distracting features in the hillside environment. 
c.  Surface materials shall be rough-textured to blend with the coarseness of landscaping and natural vegetation. Textured stucco, wood, earth tone brick and coarse block are appropriate. 
d.  A harmonious mixture of materials, color, and forms combined to achieve a mottled effect shall be used to blend with the natural hillsides. 
e.  Roof materials shall be of rough-textured, fire-retardant material. Roof colors shall be darker tones, including browns, black, greens and terra cotta. Bright colon shall be avoided. Special attention to coordinating roof design is important because of the dominant appearance of roofs in the landscape. 
3.  Architectural Elements. 
a.  Free-standing walls integral to a structure shall be of the same material and design as the structure. The height of such walls shall not exceed six (6) feet. 
b.  Free-standing wall setbacks along front yards shall be varied to avoid creating an unbroken, uniform streetscape. The height of such walls shall not exceed six (6) feet. 
c.  Where fences and walls occur on privately owned property within slope areas, fence/wall designs shall be as uniform as possible. 
d.  Continuous rear yard fences and walls across the tops of slopes shall be coordinated in design and use of materials. (See Exhibit V in appendix to this chapter.) 
e.  Wall setbacks on slopes shall not allow more than four (4) feet of solid wall or fence to show above the height line projected along the slope angle. 
f.  Retaining walls shall be designed with smooth, continuous lines that conform to the topography. Maximum wall height at the base of slopes along roadways shall not exceed five (5) feet in order to avoid a contained, channel-like effect. (See Exhibits W and X in appendix to this chapter.) 
g.  Retaining wall structures holding back grade to accommodate a patio or terrace shall conform to the natural hillside profile as much as possible. Excessively high retaining walls shall be avoided. 
h.  In deck construction, the distance between structure and grade shall conform to the natural hillside profile as much as possible. Excessively high distances between structure and grade shall be prohibited. 
D.  Landscape Treatment. 
1.  Design Regulations Relating to Slopes. 
a.  No tentative subdivision map shall be approved unless said map provides that all cut and fill slopes within street rights-of-way, on public or common land held by a homeowner's association, and all slopes over five (5) feet in height on other private land, shall be landscaped with a combination of ground cover, shrubs, and trees by the developer prior to completion of the project. 
b.  Turf that requires mowing shall not be used on slopes in excess of four to one (4:1). 
c.  Plant materials used in slope planting shall be drought-tolerant introduced species or native plants adapted to and suitable for providing vigorous rooted growth. In this regard, site plan review shall consider the City Guidelines and Specifications for Landscape Development for a list of approved slope plant materials. 
d.  In cases of severe soil problems, shrubs and tree pits can trap water leading to slope failure, and the use of hydroseed mixes or smaller plant materials may be necessary. 
e.  Shrubs shall be arranged in broad, informal masses of the same plant materials. These masses shall be combined to produce a mounding, textured slope surface, similar to the natural chaparral vegetation. 
f.  Trees shall be arranged in informal masses and shall be placed to selectively allow views from housing while partially screening buildings and reducing the scale of overpowering, long, steep slopes. (See Exhibit Y in appendix to this chapter.) 
g.  Plant materials shall be placed in informal masses to help alleviate the impact of uniform, graded benches. (See Exhibit Z in appendix to this chapter.) 
h.  Shrubs shall be randomly spaced in masses in overall quantities to provide a minimum of one (1) shrub per seventy-five (75) square feet. Trees shall be provided in overall quantities to provide a minimum of one per five hundred (500) square feet. 
2.  Design Regulations Relating to Skylines. 
a.  Skyline planting shall be used along recontoured secondary ridgelines to recreate the linear silhouette and to act as a backdrop for structures. Trees shall be planted to create a continuous linear silhouette since gaps in the planting will not give the desired effect. 
b.  Trees that grow close to the height of structures shall be planted between buildings to eliminate the open gap and blend the roof lines into one (1) continuous silhouette. (See Exhibit AA in appendix to this chapter.) 
3.  Design Regulations Relating to Street Trees. 
a.  Street trees shall be selected which create an intimate scale along the streetscape. Streets will be narrower in hillside development and large trees will overpower the space. 
b.  Arrangement of street trees shall be carefully planned to create an informal character and to not block potential views. 
c.  Street trees along roads without adjacent development shall be selectively located to provide an edge to the road. They shall not be uniformly spaced, but used in groups to enhance and frame views. It may be appropriate to eliminate trees along roads through natural open space areas. 
d.  Street tree quantities and types shall be provided as required by the City Guidelines and Specifications for Landscape Development. 
4.  Landscape Edge Conditions. 
a.  The interface between developments and open space and internally between structures on slopes is critical to blending architecture and landscape and shall be given special attention. 
b.  Edges shall be designed to provide either partial or complete visual buffering and provide a transition from architecture to grade. (See Exhibit BB in appendix to this chapter.) 
c.  Planting along the slope side of development shall be designed to allow controlled views out, yet partially screen and soften the architecture. In general, fifty percent (50%) screening with plant materials shall be accomplished. 
d.  In situations where edge planting at lower levels of slope development may block views from above, height restrictions on plant materials shall be applied. 
e.  Between natural open space and development, a fire break or fuel modification line shall be provided. This zone shall consist of at least one hundred (100) feet and must have native ground covers removed, larger trees and shrubs pruned and a fire-resistive ground cover added. (See Exhibit CC in appendix to this chapter.) 
(Prior code § 27A-48)  
15.40.080 - Variances. 
A.  ..... At the specific plan, tentative subdivision map, or site plan review stage of development, the applicant may also apply for a variance from the requirements of the Hillside Development Regulations if any or all of the following circumstances exist: 
1.  There is an internal conflict within the Hillside Development Regulations such that the attainment of one objective or requirement can only be achieved by permitting nonattainment of another objective or requirement. 
2.  There is a conflict between the Hillside Development Regulations and other City regulations or ordinances applicable to development of the property. 
3.  Compliance with the Hillside Development Regulations may endanger the public health or safety. In cases where such a conflict exists between this chapter and the provisions of the Grading Ordinance, the Grading Ordinance shall control over the Hillside Development Regulations. 
4.  Due to special conditions or exceptional characteristics of the property or its location, the strict application of the development requirements (Section 15.40.070) would not achieve the goals and objectives of this chapter. 
B.  ..... The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a written statement setting forth the following information, in addition to the information submitted with the specific plan, tentative subdivision map, or site plan (as applicable): 
1.  The location of the proposed variance; 
2.  The provision of the Hillside Development Regulations from which the applicant proposes to vary; 
3.  The nature and extent of the proposed variance; 
4.  An explanation of the efforts made to design the development without the need for a variance and the justification for the variance in relationship to the standards set forth in this section. 
C.  ..... The application for a variance and any appeals thereof shall be heard and determined in accordance with the procedures applicable to the specific plan, tentative subdivision map, or site plan application of which the variance is a part. 
D.  ..... No variance shall be granted unless the approving body makes a determination that at least one (1) of the four (4) circumstances in this section exists, and then only if and to the extent that the need for a variance cannot practicably be eliminated by means other than a variance. In acting upon any application for variance, the approving body shall set forth factual findings in support of its determination, stating why particular provisions of this chapter cannot be met. The determination as to whether a variance shall be granted is discretionary.

Chapter 15.44 - RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTROL 
 
15.44.010 - Purpose. 
The people of the City of San Clemente find and declare as follows: 
A.  The City has adopted a General Plan and City ordinances relating to the regulation of the residential development. 
B.  The City is experiencing a period of residential development which is adversely affecting the capacity of the streets and local freeway system to meet traffic demands, the capacity of parking facilities in business, beach and other areas, the capacity of area schools to absorb children, the village by the sea character of the community, the quality of life prevalent in the City, its sphere of influence and the surrounding region, and the cost to households of some utilities and municipal services. 
C.  It is the intent of the people of the City to achieve a steady, rather than a fluctuating, overly rapid, rate of residential growth each year in order that the services provided by City, school, park, utility and/or service agencies operating in the City and surrounding region can be properly and effectively staged in a manner which will not overextend existing facilities, and in order that deficient services may be brought up to required and necessary standards while minimizing, by means of long-range planning, the avoidable costs of short-sighted facility expansion. 
D.  It is the intent of the people of the City to establish control over the quality, distribution and rate of growth of the City in the interest of: 
1.  Preserving the character of the community; 
2.  Protecting the open space of the City; 
3.  Protecting the quality of life in the City; 
4.  Ensuring the adequacy of City facilities, school facilities, recreation and park facilities, and services; 
5.  Ensuring a balance of housing types and values in the City which will accommodate a variety of families including families of moderate income and older families on limited and/or fixed incomes; 
6.  Ensuring the balanced development of the City; 
7.  Preventing further significant deterioration in local air quality; 
8.  Ensuring that the traffic demands do not exceed the capacity of streets that are in character with the City's semirural nature; 
9.  Ensuring that the City does not grow in a pattern that places a severe strain on the local freeway system; 
10.  Ensuring the adequacy of fire protection and police services; 
11.  Ensuring adequate water and sanitary sewer system. 
E.  It is the purpose of this chapter to augment the policies of the City as recorded in the General Plan and other City ordinances relating to the regulation of residential development. 
F.  In order to accomplish this purpose, the City must be able to control the rate, distribution, quality and economic level of proposed development on a year-to-year basis. To this end, the residential development control system for the City codified in this chapter shall be in effect from and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter until December 31, 2006. 
G.  It is further the intent of the people of the City that the award of development allocations pursuant to this chapter be accomplished, in accordance with the criteria set forth herein, fairly, impartially and without discrimination against any particular parcel of land or development project. 
H.  It is the further intent of the people of the City that this chapter not affect the zoning or other land use approvals for a particular parcel of land or development project, but shall be a regulation of the timing, or rate, of development. 
(Prior code § 38-1)  
15.44.020 - Applicability. 
The system set out in this chapter shall apply from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter to all residential development, in the City, including mobilehomes, with the exception of the following: 
A.  Projects of not more than four (4) residential dwellings, limited to only one (1) such project per developer per calendar year; 
B.  Fourplexes or lesser-numbered multiple dwellings on a single existing lot; 
C.  Single-family residential units on a single existing lot; 
D.  Rehabilitation or remodeling of an existing dwelling, or conversion of apartments to condominiums, so long as no additional dwelling units are created; 
E.  Projects of single-family dwellings where no residential lot is less than two and one-half (2½) acres in size; and 
F.  Construction of model home complexes when a development allocation has been approved for the project and units within the model home complex will not be occupied, transferred or sold for individual occupancy until a development allocation has been received for such units, or, the units qualify under an exception provisions pursuant to this section at the time occupancy is requested. The developer shall sign an agreement to be recorded providing for these limitations prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(Prior code § 38-2)  
15.44.030 - Residential Development Evaluation Board. 
A.  ..... In order to administer the system set forth in this chapter, and especially to make the valuations set forth in Section 15.44.060, a Residential Development Evaluation Board (hereinafter called the Board) is established, consisting of the duly appointed members of the Planning Commission of the City. 
B.  ..... The procedures and bylaws of the Board shall be developed by the Board, subject to the approval of the City Council, and the provisions of this chapter. The Planning Department of the City shall serve as the staff of the Board. 
(Prior code § 38-3)  
15.44.040 - Annual residential development allocations. 
A.  ..... The number of dwelling units hereinafter to be constructed each year in the City (except for dwelling units exempted in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.44.020), is a maximum of five hundred (500). 
B.  ..... The annual allocation may be modified by the City Council to an amount not greater than ten (10) percent more or less for any given year, provided that the annual allocation for the next succeeding year shall be set higher or lower, as the case may be, in order to redress any excess or deficiency. This ten (10) percent rule shall apply in all instances except that expressly provided for in Section 15.44.070(A). 
C.  ..... The annual allocation shall be continuously applicable to the City's jurisdictional boundaries and shall not be modified by reason of annexation or additional territory. 
(Prior code § 38-4)  
15.44.050 - Development allocation applicationRequired. 
No building permit of nonexempt projects may be issued unless a development allocation for such project has been granted. At any time prior to obtaining a building permit, the developer of proposed projects not exempted from application for development allocation pursuant to the provisions of Section 15.44.020 shall apply for a development allocation as set forth herein. 
(Prior code § 38-5)  
15.44.060 - Development allocation applicationEvaluation. 
The Board shall consider annually all applications properly submitted and shall make recommendations to the City Council based on the criteria set forth below: 
A.  Availability of Public Facilities and Services . The Board shall examine each application for its relation to or impact upon local public facilities and services, and shall rate each development by the assignment of from zero (0) to ten (10) points (zero (0) indicating very poor, ten (10) indicating excellent) on each of the following attributes: 
1.  The capacity of the water system to provide for the needs of the proposed development without system extensions beyond those normally installed by the developer; 
2.  The capacity of the sanitary sewers to dispose of the wastes of the proposed development without system extension beyond those normally installed by the developer; 
3.  The capacity of the drainage facilities to adequately dispose of the surface runoff of the proposed development without system extensions beyond those normally installed by the developer; 
4.  The ability of the Fire Department to provide fire protection according to the established response standards of the City without the necessity of establishing a new station or requiring addition of major equipment or housing facilities to an existing station; 
5.  The capacity of the appropriate school to absorb the children expected to inhabit a proposed development without necessitating or adding to double sessions or other unusual scheduling or classroom overcrowding; 
6.  The capacity of major street linkage to provide for the needs of the proposed development without substantially altering existing traffic patterns or overloading the existing street system, and the capacity of Interstate 5 within the City limits to provide for the needs of the proposed development without substantially altering the freeway level of service; 
7.  The availability of public facilities (such as parks, playgrounds, etc.) to meet the demands for vital public services without extension of services beyond those provided by the developer; 
8.  The ability of the Police Department to provide police protection and service according to the established response standards of the City without the necessity of establishing a new station or requiring the addition of major equipment or facilities to an existing station; 
9.  The above shall be evaluated in the manner provided for in the "RDEB criteria" as adopted and amended from time to time by resolution of the City Council. 
B.  Quality of Design and Contribution of Public Welfare and Amenity. The Board shall further examine each application and shall rate each development by the assignment of from zero (0) to ten (10) points (zero (0) indicating very poor, ten (10) indicating excellent) on each of the following attributes: 
1.  Site and architectural design quality which may be indicated by the harmony of the proposed buildings in terms of size, height, color and location with existing neighboring development; 
2.  The amount and character of open space landscaping; 
3.  The amount and character of slope landscaping; 
4.  Site and architectural design quality which may be indicated by the arrangement of the site for efficiency of circulation, on- and off-site traffic safety, privacy, etc.; 
5.  The provisions of public and/or private usable open space; 
6.  Contributions to and extensions of existing systems of foot or bicycle paths, equestrian trails and facilities and/or greenbelts; 
7.  The provision of needed public facilities such as critical linkages in the major street system, school rooms, functional parks, or other vital public facilities; 
8.  Site and architectural design quality which may be indicated by the amount and character of modification of the topography, including quantity of grading, extent of natural slopes and/or filled and impact on ridgelines; 
9.  Absence of deleterious impact on trees and archeological sites; 
10.  The provision of significant water conservation features; 
11.  The provision of energy generation and conservation features, such as additional insulation, house siting and design, solar techniques and other innovation techniques; 
12.  Absence of deleterious impact on the physical and/or aesthetical environment; 
13.  The provision of units in a project formally reserved and dedicated as senior housing. If the project does not include senior housing, this criteria shall not be subtracted or figured into the total percentage points; 
14.  Those specific units which are formally dedicated for occupancy by low-income persons within a project which is funded or subsidized as a low-income project pursuant to the provision of applicable federal, state or local laws or programs, shall be entitled to ten (10) additional bonus points. For the purpose of this chapter, a project is funded or subsidized pursuant to applicable federal, state or local laws or programs if it receives a loan, grant or continuing financial subsidy for the purpose of developing low-income housing units. If the project does not include low-cost housing, this criteria shall not be subtracted or figured into the total percentage points; 
15.  Absence of deleterious impact on historical or cultural landmarks; 
16.  The above shall be evaluated in the manner provided for in the "RDEB criteria" as adopted and amended from time to time by resolution of the City Council. 
C.  After having studied each application in accordance with subsections A and B of this section, in regard to each of these criteria, or so many of them as may be applicable, and having assigned evaluation points on a scale of zero (0) to ten (10) in accordance with its findings, the Board shall prepare a chart documenting the points awarded in each subdivision of subsections A and B of this section. The chart shall also indicate the subtotals for points in subsections A and B of this section and the overall totals for points awarded in all these sections. In addition, the Board shall prepare three (3) lists as follows: 
1.  A list ranking the competing projects from the highest to the lowest percentage of points scored in subsection A of this section. The percentage shall be calculated by dividing the points scored in subsection A of this section by the total maximum points possible in subsection A of this section. 
2.  A listing ranking the competing projects from the highest to the lowest percentage of points scored in subsection B of this section. The percentage shall be calculated by dividing the points scored in subsection B of this section by the total maximum possible points in subsections A and B of this section. 
3.  A cumulative list ranking the competing projects from the highest to the lowest percentage of the combined points scored in subsection B of this section combined. The percentage shall be calculated by dividing the total points scored in subsections A and B of this section by the total maximum points possible in said subsections A and B. 
D.  Having evaluated each development in accordance with the criteria set out in this section, the Board shall publish in appropriate ways the rating given to each development on each of those criteria. The Board shall then schedule a public hearing to be held within fifteen (15) to thirty (30) days of classification of the point assignments made by the Board. 
1.  The applicant or any interested party may request the Board, at public hearing, to reevaluate the point assignment made on any or all of the criteria. The primary criteria for the Board to alter its point assignment on a particular development is demonstration by the applicant or interested party that there exists pertinent information which the Board was not aware of at the time of the original evaluation. 
2.  Any applicant or interested party who is dissatisfied with the Board's action may, within seven (7) days of the action, submit written notification of such dissent to the City Clerk, which will be furnished to the City Council prior to the awarding of development allocations. 
E.  Having evaluated each application, the Board shall present their lists of evaluations and recommendations to the City Council for the awarding of development allocations. 
(Prior code § 38-6)  
15.44.070 - Development allocation awardsPoint requirements. 
A.  ..... The City Council shall consider, at a public hearing, the Board recommendations and rankings of the proposed development in each of the three (3) lists prepared pursuant to Section 15.44.060 and shall award development allocations based on their evaluation of those recommendations and rankings. 
1.  Development Program Allocation. The number of dwelling units for which development allocations shall be issued shall not exceed the allocations established in accordance with Section 15.44.040. 
2.  Allocation Limitation. No single developer shall, in any one (1) year, be issued a development allocation for dwelling units in excess of a number to be established by resolution of the City Council. 
3.  Minimum Point Requirements. The City Council shall eliminate from consideration any development which has not been assigned the minimum points required to meet the minimum standards of that specific criterion, exclusive of bonus points. If in a given year the highest-ranking development does not at least meet both the minimum point requirements, the City Council shall make no development allotment for that year. The number of units will then be added, as the only allowed exception to the ten (10) percent rule in Section 15.44.040(B), to the allocation for the ensuing year. 
B.  ..... The City Council will make the annual development allocations at a time to be selected by the City Council, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following submission of the lists and recommendations of the Board as provided in Section 15.44.060(E). 
C.  ..... Should an applicant for a custom lot sale project or such applicant's successor-in-interest fail to initiate construction within five (5) years after award of the development allocation, the City Council may rescind all or part of the development allocation and reassign the allocation to an on-going project that received an allocation during the same or any subsequent year. 
D.  ..... Any applicant that has modified or altered a project which has previously been awarded development allocations may request that the City reallocate the previously awarded development allocations to the modified or altered project when such modifications or alterations are not "minor" as that term is used in Resolution 86-93, Exhibit "B"(6) (i). An applicant seeking to reallocate previously awarded development allocations to a modified or altered project shall complete the reallocation application on the form provided by the City, and shall submit the application, together with the required fee, to the Community Development Department. The City Council shall reallocate the previously awarded development allocations to a modified or altered project if it is determined at a public hearing that the following conditions are satisfied: 
1.  The project has previously been awarded development allocations; 
2.  The applicant is not seeking to increase the number of units in the project; 
3.  All elements of the revised or altered project meet all minimum City standards required for the project; 
4.  The revised or altered project has previously been awarded all necessary discretionary approvals; and 
5.  After a reevaluation of the revised or altered project pursuant to the then-current Residential Development Evaluation Board's standards, the points awarded to the revised or altered project are equal to or greater than the number of RDEB points in each RDEB category originally assigned to the project. 
 If the above conditions are not satisfied, the applicant must resubmit the project for development allocations in the next annual development allocation sequence as if no allocations were ever awarded. 
 Applications for a reallocation of previously awarded development allocations for modified or altered projects may be submitted at any time. The reallocation of development allocations shall not affect the number of development allocations to be awarded in the year in which the reallocation is made. 
(Prior code § 38-7)  
15.44.080 - Development allocation awardsTies. 
Should the arrangement of projects as provided in Section 15.44.070(A) produce the situation in which two (2) projects have equal evaluation point scores, but only one (1) project can be permitted within the quota, the City Council may offer those applicants a pro rata share of the number of units available within the quota, or may dispose of such a tie in any other manner deemed equitable by the City Council. 
(Prior code § 38-8)  
15.44.090 - Judicial review. 
Any legal action to challenge any decision of the Board, City Council or any other governmental body performing a function under this chapter shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction within thirty (30) days immediately following the action challenged. 
(Prior code § 38-9)  
15.44.100 - Amendments. 
The City Council may, after a public hearing, by a four-fifths ( 4/5 ) vote, amend any part of this chapter, providing the amendment is consistent with the intent of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no amendment to the type of exemptions provided in Section 15.44.020 or to the number of available annual allocations provided in Section 15.44.040 shall be effective without prior ratification of a majority of the voters of the City at a general or special election.

Chapter 15.52 - PUBLIC FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND FEE 
 
15.52.010 - Public facilities construction fund fee. 
A.  Purpose. ..... The City Council finds that, in order to mitigate the impact of new development on beach parking, municipal office space, and public safety services, the City will need to: (1) improve beach parking areas; (2) acquire additional office space for municipal staff; and (3) expend more resources to furnish public safety services to the citizens of San Clemente. The City Council has determined that a public facilities construction fund fee is necessary to finance these expenditures. The City Council further finds that the establishment of the public facilities construction fund fee is consistent with the General Plan of the City. 
B.  Establishment of Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee. ..... The City establishes the "Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee" which has been created by combining the Public Safety Building Construction Fee, the Beach Parking Impact Fee and the Civic Center Construction Fund Fee and adding thereto an additional fee component referred to above as the "Civic Center Construction Fund Fee." The "Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee" is established and imposed upon the issuance of all building permits issued for the development of new units within the city. This fee shall be calculated to reflect the development's fair share of the cost of mitigating the increased demand such development places on beach parking, municipal office space, and public safety services within the City. The City Council shall, by resolution, set forth the specific amount of the Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee for different classes of development, establish different geographical boundaries, and specify the geographical boundaries, by separate resolution. 
C.  Use of Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee. ..... That portion of the revenues and interest generated by the Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee attributable to the need for funding capital expenses necessary to fund public safety services shall be deposited in that existing account referred to as the Public Safety Construction Fund Fee Account. That portion of the revenues and interest generated by the Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee attributable to the need for improved beach parking shall be deposited in that existing account referred to as the Beach Parking Impact Fee Account. That portion of the revenues and interest generated by the Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee attributable to new municipal office space shall be deposited in an account referred to as the Civic Center Construction Fund Fee Account. The City Council shall set forth the manner of dividing the Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee into these separate accounts by separate resolution. 
D.  Adjustment of Fee. ..... The Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee shall annually be adjusted each January 1st by the increase or decrease in the consumer price index reflected in the "Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers - Los Angeles - Anaheim - Riverside - All Items, 1982-1984 = 100" as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The city Council may also adjust such fee when it finds that the cost of providing beach parking, obtaining municipal office space, or providing public safety services has increased in excess of the change in the consumer price index. 
E.  Collection and Refund. ..... The amount of fees due hereunder shall be determined and collected at the time a building permit is sought for the respective units. No building permits shall be issued authorizing the construction or establishment of any units without payment of the fee. Refunds for payment will be allowed upon application, when it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Manager or his or her designee that the unit has not been established or constructed. 
F.  Exemptions and Appeals. ..... A building permit applicant may appeal the imposition or amount of the Public Facilities Construction Fund Fee on its development by submitting a written appeal to the Director of Community Development or the Director's designee. The Director shall review the appeal and rule thereon within sixty (60) days of receipt of that appeal. The appellant shall show that its development is not the type of project which will add additional demand on beach parking, municipal office space, or public safety services. Any determination of the Director or the Director's designee may be appealed to the City Council in the same manner as provided under Chapter 17.12 of the City Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. 1174 § 2, 1996: prior code § 32A-12)  
Chapter 15.56 - DRAINAGE FACILITIES FEES 
 
15.56.010 - Established. 
A.  ..... All development hereafter undertaken shall pay a sum as set forth hereunder as a fee charged for the purpose of defraying the actual or estimated cost of constructing planned drainage facilities within the area from which the fees comprising the fund were collected, or to reimburse the City for the cost of engineering and administrative services to form the district and design and construct the facilities. The City may accept consideration in lieu of the payment of fees. 
B.  ..... Fee amounts shall be: 
Fee Sub-Area 	Fee Per Gross Acre 
Prima Deshecha Canada 	$5,633.00 per acre

(Prior code § 32A-8)  
Chapter 15.60 - TRAFFIC IMPACT FEES 
 
15.60.010 - Purpose. 
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the General Plan of the City, including but not limited to the Circulation, Housing and Land Use Elements, all specific plans of the City, the Zoning Ordinance of the City, and the City of San Clemente Regional Circulation Financing and Phasing Program (herein "RCFPP"), and in order to mitigate the traffic impacts caused by new development in the benefit zones identified in the RCFPP, certain public roadways and associated improvements must be constructed. The City Council has determined that a traffic impact fee, which is chargeable to all new development in the benefit zones identified in the RCFPP, is needed in order to finance the construction of these roadways and their associated improvements. The City Council finds that the traffic impact fee will cause development in the benefit zones identified in the RCFPP to pay their fair share of the construction costs of these improvements. In establishing this traffic impact fee, the City Council has found that the fee is consistent with the General Plan of the City. 
(Prior code § 32A-13(a))  
15.60.020 - Establishment of feeBenefit zones. 
A traffic impact fee is established and imposed upon the development in the benefit zones identified in the RCFPP in the manner provided below. The City Council shall, by resolution, describe the benefit zones in which the traffic impact fee shall be imposed and set forth specific amount of the traffic impact fee for each benefit zone. Except as provided below, the traffic impact fee shall be paid by each building permit applicant, in the amounts required by the resolution of the City Council, prior to the issuance of the building permits for which the fee is charged. In lieu of requiring RCFPP payments prior to issuance of building permits, the City Council may, through the approval of one (1) or more development agreements, permit a person developing property within the City to fix the amount of their RCFPP payment on the effective date of the development agreement and phase those payments over a period of years. Any RCFPP payment obligation fixed by development agreement shall be secured by irrevocable, demand payment letters of credit or other forms of security acceptable to the City. In addition, the City Manager may permit persons with de minimis payment obligations to defer payment of their RCFPP fee until prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. 1155 § 1, 1995: prior code 32A-13(b))  
15.60.030 - Limitation. 
The payment of the traffic impact fee shall not be required for the construction of any "major thoroughfare" for which the applicant has been or will be required to contribute pursuant to Chapter 15.68 of this code. 
(Prior code § 32A-13(c))  
15.60.040 - Creation of accountCollection of fees. 
The City shall establish an individual account for each improvement identified in the RCFPP for each benefit zone (herein "improvement account"). Except as otherwise provided herein, the traffic impact fee shall be collected prior to the issuance of each building permit for new development in the benefit zones identified in the RCFPP. In lieu of requiring RCFPP payments prior to issuance of building permits, the City Council may, through the approval of one or more development agreements, permit a person developing property within the City to fix the amount of their RCFPP payment on the effective date of the development agreement and phase those payments over a period of years. Any RCFPP payment obligation fixed by development agreement shall be secured by irrevocable, demand payment letters of credit or other forms of security acceptable to the City. After collection, the funds shall be apportioned and deposited in accordance with the RCFPP into the appropriate improvement account within the benefit zone in which the building permit was issued or the fee paid. In addition, the City Manager may permit persons with de minimis payment obligations for nonresidential property to defer payment of their RCFPP fee until prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. For purposes of this chapter, "de minimis payment obligations" shall be defined as less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). 
(Ord. 1155 § 2, 1995: prior code § 32A-13(d))  
15.60.050 - Use of funds. 
A.  ..... The revenues placed in each improvement account, along with any interest earnings thereon, shall solely be used to: 
1.  Pay for the City's future construction of the improvements described in the RCFPP; 
2.  To reimburse the City for the construction of improvements described in the RCFPP when such improvements were constructed with funds advanced by the City from other sources; or 
3.  Reimburse developers who have been required or permitted by Section 15.60.060 to install such improvements which are oversized with supplemental size, length, or capacity. 
B.  ..... For the purpose of this section, the term "construction" includes preliminary studies, design, acquisition of right-of-way, administration of construction contracts, actual construction, and all costs related thereto. 
(Prior code § 32A-13(e))  
15.60.060 - Construction of improvements by building permit applicant. 
Whenever an applicant constructs one (1) or more of the improvements identified in the RCFPP and such improvements exceed such applicant's obligation as defined in the RCFPP, the City shall both enter into a reimbursement agreement with the applicant, and provide to the applicant a traffic impact fee credit in an amount equal to the applicant's fair share contribution to the construction of that particular improvement. The reimbursement amount shall not include the traffic impact fee that was paid or would have been payable by the applicant if it had not constructed the improvements(s). The reimbursement agreement shall contain adequate provisions to assure the proper and reasonable accounting for costs subject to reimbursement. 
(Prior code § 32A-13(f))  
15.60.070 - Adjustment of fee. 
The traffic impact fee shall be annually adjusted on January 1st in accordance with the percentage change during the preceding year in the "California Construction Cost Index," as published by the State of California Department of Transportation. In addition to this annual adjustment, the City Council may also adjust the traffic impact fee on the basis of new, updated project cost estimates, substantial changes in the City's General Plan, or other pertinent information. 
(Prior code § 32A-13(g))  
15.60.080 - Exemptions and appeals. 
A.  ..... The following types of development shall be exempt from the payment of the traffic impact fees: 
1.  Property tax exempt religious facilities; 
2.  Property tax exempt educational facilities; 
3.  Property tax exempt welfare or public social service facilities; 
4.  Government-owned facilities; 
5.  Other types of development which the City Council may determine is exempt from time to time by resolution.

The Director or his/her designee shall rule on the exemption within sixty (60) days of receipt of such written application. If dissatisfied with the determination of the Director or Director's designee, the applicant may appeal the determination to the City Council under the provisions of Section 17.12.140 this code. 
(Prior code 32A-13(h))  
15.60.090 - Addition of or amendment to benefit zone boundaries. 
A.  ..... The City Council may amend the boundaries of any benefit zone after conducting a noticed public hearing. Notice of the time and place of said hearing, including preliminary information related to the boundaries of the proposed benefit zone and estimated costs and method of fee apportionment, shall be given at least ten (10) calendar days before the hearing by publishing the notice at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the benefit zone, by sending notices by first class mail addressed to each property owner within the benefit zone, and by sending first class notices to any persons who have filed a written request for such notice with the Community Development Director. 
B.  ..... At the public hearing the City Council will consider the testimony, written protests, and other evidence. At the conclusion of the public hearing the City Council may, unless a majority written protest is filed and not withdrawn as specified in Section 15.60.040, determine to establish an area of benefit. If established, the City Council shall adopt a resolution describing the boundaries of the area of benefit, setting forth the cost, whether actual or estimated, and the method of fee apportionment. A certified copy of such resolution shall be recorded by the City Clerk with the Orange County Recorder's Office. 
C.  ..... Written protests shall be received by the City Clerk at any time prior to the close of the public hearing. If written protests are filed by the owners of more than one-half (½) of the area of the property to be benefitted by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented by the protests to less than one-half (½) of the area to be benefitted, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned, and the City Council shall not, for one (1) year from the filing of said written protests, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same improvement under the provisions of this section. Any protests may be withdrawn by the owner making the same, in writing, at any time prior to the close of the public meeting. 
D.  ..... If any majority protest is directed against only a portion of the improvement, then all further proceedings under the provisions of this section to construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one (1) year, but the City Council shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings not including any part of the improvement so protested against. Such proceeding shall be commenced by a new notice and public hearing as set forth in Section 15.60.010. 
E.  ..... Nothing in this section shall prohibit the City Council, within such one (1) year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of an improvement or portion of the improvements so protested against if it finds, by affirmative vote of four-fifths ( 4/5 ) of its members, that the owners of more than one-half (½) of the area of the property to be benefitted are in favor of going forward with such improvement or portion thereof. 
(Prior code § 32A-13(i))  
15.60.100 - Account transfers. 
When deemed appropriate by majority vote of the City Council, the revenues contained within one (1) or more of the improvement accounts established pursuant to this section may be transferred from one (1) account (the "transferring account") into one or more of the other improvement accounts established under this section ("receiving account"). The transferred funds shall thereafter be used to construct the RCFPP improvement for which the receiving account was established as provided in Section 15.60.050. 
(Ord. 1155, § 3 (part))  
15.60.110 - Improvement account reimbursement. 
Revenues transferred from a transferring account into a receiving account shall be proportionately reimbursed from the post-construction revenues that would have been deposited into the receiving account. By way of example, assume funds in the amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) and four million dollars ($4,000,000.00) were transferred from RCFPP account Nos. 1 and 2, respectively (the "transferring accounts"), into RCFPP account No. 3 (the "receiving account") for the construction of the improvement for which account No. 3 was established. Upon completion of funding the construction of the improvement account No. 3 improvement, the revenues collected from the benefit zone for improvement account No. 3 shall be subsequently deposited into improvement account Nos. 1 and 2 at a ratio of 1:2, respectively. 
(Ord. 1155 § 3 (part))  
Chapter 15.64 - AVENIDA LA PATA SUPPLEMENTARY ROAD FEE PROGRAM 
 
15.64.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of the Avenida La Pata supplementary road fee program is to establish a mechanism for assessing new development their pro rata fair share of the cost of constructing Avenida La Pata between the City limits and the Ortega Highway in order to mitigate the traffic impacts caused by new development within the enumerated benefit zones. The City Council has determined that the Avenida La Pata supplementary road fee is needed in order to finance the construction of Avenida La Pata from the Ortega Highway to the city boundary. In establishing the Avenida La Pata supplementary road fee program, the City Council has found that the fee is consistent with the General Plan of the City. 
(Prior code § 32A-14(a))  
15.64.020 - Establishment of feeBenefit zones. 
A.  ..... The Avenida La Pata supplementary road fee (the "fee") is established and imposed upon the issuance of all building permits for new development within those benefit zones established by resolution of the City Council. The City Council shall set forth the specific amount of the Avenida La Pata supplementary road fee and describe the areas of benefit in which the fee shall be imposed by separate resolution. The fee shall be paid by each applicant for a building permit for new development within the established benefit zones in the amounts required by the resolution of the City Council prior to the issuance of building permits. 
B.  ..... For the purpose of this section, "new development" shall mean: 
1.  As to residential development, the net additional dwelling units constructed or created on the applicant's property above the number of dwelling units existing on the property as of the date the ordinance codified in this section is adopted. A "second unit," as referred to in Section 65852.2 of the California Government Code, shall be deemed an additional dwelling unit if constructed or created after the adoption of said ordinance. 
2.  As to nonresidential development, the net additional square footage of gross building area constructed or created on the applicant's property above the gross building area existing on the property as of the date said ordinance is adopted. 
3.  Improvement, remodeling, rehabilitation or replacement of or additions to an existing dwelling unit shall not be deemed to be new development for purposes of this section so long as no additional dwelling units are constructed or created.

Chapter 15.76 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION*  
Article I. - Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods 
 
15.76.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units' authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of San Clemente does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  ..... The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  ..... These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
A.  To protect human life and health; 
B.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage. 
G.  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  To insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this includes methods and provisions for: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as Floodplain Ordinance, Grading Ordinance and Erosion Control Ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in flood prone areas. The term describes such federal, state or local regulations or any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood loss and damage prevention and reduction. 
"Flood-proofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93 and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet flood proofing.) 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.76.240, Variance Procedure, of this, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, which is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
"Hardship" as related to Section 15.76.250, Variance Procedure, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including but not limited to: 
a.  The wet flood proofing standard in Section 15.76.150(C); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.76.150(A); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.76.150(B); 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.76.170. 
2.  For residential structures, all sub-grade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
"Manufactured home park or subsection" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for sale or rent. 
"Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation, which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
"Mudslide" describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. 
"Mudslide, (i.e., mudflow) prone area" means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow. 
"New construction" means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after November 26, 1979 when the first City of San Clemente floodplain ordinance was adopted, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after November 26, 1979 when the first City of San Clemente floodplain ordinance was adopted. 
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
"One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" means a flood which has a one (1) percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the "base flood," which will be the term used throughout this chapter. See "Base flood." 
"Person" means an individual or his or her agent, firm, partnership, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions. 
"Primary frontal dune" means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope. 
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 15.76.250, Variance Procedure, of this means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle that is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impact may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing State or Federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Sand dunes" means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach. 
"Sheet flow area"see "Area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, V1-V30, VE or V. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"V zone"see "Coastal high hazard area." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
"Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002; Ord. No. 1669 , §§ 15, 3-5-2019)  
15.76.060 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards within the jurisdiction of the City. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard, areas of flood-related erosion hazard, and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Orange County, California and Incorporated Areas," dated February 5, 1992, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs) and all subsequent revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. In addition, the City Engineer shall have the authority, on behalf of the City, to recommend to FEMA that changes be made in said designated areas based upon new and updated engineering information that becomes available after the effective date of the ordinance adopting this Section (as amended), and said changes shall take effect when approved by FEMA. The City Clerk and the City Engineer shall each retain a copy of the aforedescribed FEMA flood insurance study and rate map, as the same may be amended from time to time in accordance with this section, and shall make the same available upon request for public review and inspection. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.080 - Compliance. 
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in this chapter in connection with conditions) shall be unlawful. Nothing shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002; Ord. No. 1664 , § 39, 9-18-2018)  
15.76.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.100 - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
B.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; 
C.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.110 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.120 - Establishment of development permit. 
A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards or areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) established in Section 15.76.230. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
A.  Site plan, including but not limited to:

(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.130 - Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. 
The Community Development Director is appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City; and 
5.  All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letter's of Map Revisions (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. 
1.  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.76.070, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Article IV of this chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption; or 
2.  If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order to administer Section 15.76.070. 
a.  Simplified Method. 
i.  One hundred (100) year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a US Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and 
ii.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA; or 
b.  Detailed Method. 
i.  One hundred (100) year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the US Army Corps of Engineers' HEC-HMS computer program; and 
ii.  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the US Army Corps of Engineers' HEC-RAS computer program. 
C.  Notification of other agencies. 
1.  Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse. 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations. 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letter's of Map Revisions (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in Corporate/City Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate/city boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate/city limits. 
D.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed, the following: 
1.  The certification required by Section 15.76.160(B) and 15.76.160(C)(3) (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  The certification required in Section 15.76.160(C)(3) (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  The certification required in Section 15.76.160(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
4.  The certification required in Section 15.76.160(C)(4)(a) or (b) (wet floodproofing standard); 
5.  The certified elevation required in Section 15.76.190(B) (subdivision standards); 
6.  The certification required in Section 15.76.220(A) (floodway encroachments); 
7.  The information required in Section 15.76.230(F) (coastal construction standards). 
E.  Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards, areas of flood-related erosion hazards or areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Article V of this chapter. 
F.  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.76.080. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002; Ord. No. 1669 , §§ 6, 7, 3-5-2019)

3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation the State of California recommends at least two (2) feet above the base flood elevation) and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  ..... All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites located within Zone VE on the community's flood insurance rate map will meet the requirements of Section 15.76.200(A) and Section 15.76.230.

(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.220 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.76.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.230 - Coastal high hazard areas. 
Within coastal high hazard areas established in Section 15.76.060, the following standards shall apply: 
A.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns and securely anchored to such pilings or columns so that the lowest horizontal portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood elevation. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. 
B.  All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide. 
C.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor free of obstructions or constructed with breakaway walls. Such enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation and will be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. 
D.  Fill shall not be used for structural support of buildings. 
E.  Manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited. 
F.  The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain and maintain the following records: 
1.  Certification by a registered engineer or architect that a proposed structure complies with subsection (A) of this section; 
2.  The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings or columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether such structures contain a basement. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.250 - Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas. 
A.  ..... The Floodplain Administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area. 
B.  ..... Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonable safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to the: 
1.  Type and quality of soils; 
2.  Evidence of ground water or surface water problems; 
3.  Depth and quality of any fill; 
4.  Overall slope of the site; and 
5.  Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope. 
C.  ..... Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the Floodplain Administrator shall require that: 
1.  A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering; 
2.  The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages; 
3.  The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either onsite or offsite disturbances; and 
4.  Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.260 - Flood related erosion prone area. 
The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood related erosion prone areas as known to the community. 
A.  Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood related erosion and will not cause flood related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
B.  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
C.  Within Zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.270 - Variance procedure. 
A.  Nature of Variances. ..... The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning laws that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.280 - Appeal board. 
A.  ..... The City Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  ..... The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination of this chapter. 
C.  ..... In passing upon such applications, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in others of this chapter, and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and Floodplain Management Program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
D.  ..... Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25) for one hundred dollars ($100) of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County of Orange Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
E.  ..... The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  ..... Generally, variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements, and other proposed new development, to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items listed in subsection (C) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
G.  ..... Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (C) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
H.  ..... The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(Ord. 1265 § 1 (part), 2002)  
15.76.290 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  ..... Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Section 15.76.160(B) and Section 15.76.160(C) of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the various increases. 
B.  ..... Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation or restoration of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.76.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  ..... Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  ..... Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  ..... Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship (as defined in Section 15.76.050 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, (as defined in Section 15.76.050see "Public safety and nuisance") cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F.  ..... Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection (A) through (D) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not create a public nuisance. 
G.  ..... Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.76.270 and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

In this instance, the Planning Commission's determination shall be binding on the decision making authority designated for the tentative map (specified in Section 16.04.015). 
D.  Modifications. 
1.  Whenever the land involved in a subdivision is of such size or shape, or is subject to such title limitation of record, or is affected by such topographical location or conditions, or is to be devoted to such use, or is subject to such regulations by the Zoning Code that it is impractical in the particular case to conform to the strict application of the requirements of this chapter, the advisory agency may make such modifications thereof as are reasonably necessary or expedient; provided, that the modification is in conformity with the City's General Plan and with the spirit and intent of the Subdivision Map Act and of this Chapter; and provided further, that the Planning Director transmits, with the recommendation of the tentative map of the subdivision to the City Council, a report in writing setting forth each modification allowed and the facts relied upon by the advisory agency for the allowance of the modification. 
2.  When a conditional use permit has been granted for a planned residential development in any district and such development is subdivided, exceptions to certain subdivision standards, in addition to those exceptions which may be authorized pursuant to subsection (D)(1) of this section, may be recommended by the Planning Commission and authorized by the City Council as follows: 
a.  Exceptions to the requirements and regulations relative to lot size, width and shape may be permitted when: 
i.  An open space or recreational area is to be provided for the use and benefit of all the dwelling units in the development; and 
ii.  The total land area of the development divided by the total number of dwelling units provides an average building site area per dwelling unit equal to or more than that required by the regulations of the base district in which the development is located. Total land area of the development shall include the land area of open spaces, private driveways and walkways and recreational areas, but shall not include any land area being set aside for public street rights-of-way. 
b.  Exceptions to the requirement that lots abut on a street may be permitted when: 
i.  Adequate and permanent legal access from a street to each family dwelling unit is provided for pedestrians and emergency vehicles; and

No exception to the standard subdivision requirements shall be permitted unless the City Council determines that the subdivider has adequately provided for such maintenance and payment of taxes. Covenants, conditions and restrictions will be approved by the planning staff, in regard to ongoing maintenance in open spaces or recreational areas by homeowners' associations. 
E.  Change in Conditions. 
1.  A subdivider shall submit a written application to modify or eliminate conditions of approval for a subdivision. Conditions of approval may be changed or eliminated only if the original decision making authority finds grading, traffic, water quality, infrastructure, or other aspects of the subdivision changed and such changes made conditions of approval unreasonable or arbitrary. Applications shall provide sufficient facts to demonstrate that characteristics of a subdivision have changed since its approval and prove such changes have made the conditions of approval arbitrary or unreasonable. 
2.  Upon receipt of the application, the decision making authority shall fix the time and place for its consideration and give notice thereof to the subdivider or owner and the City departments referred to in Section 16.12.080(A) of this code.

G.  Enforcement. ..... No land shall be conveyed, nor shall any building be constructed, nor shall a permit for the construction of a building be issued, nor shall any land be used or a certificate of use and occupancy be issued, except for model homes, until a final parcel map or final tract map substantially in conformance with an approved tentative parcel map or tentative tract map has been recorded by the County Recorder; and any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell made contrary to these provisions is voidable to the extent and in the same manner provided in the Subdivision Map Act. 
H.  Certificate of Compliance. 
1.  No City department or agency shall issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and the provisions of this code, if the Director finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefor was the owner of the real property at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefor is the current owner of the real property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of his or her interest in such real property. 
2.  If a City department or agency proposes to issue a permit or grant approval for the development of any such real property referred to above, the matter shall first be referred to the Planning Commission, which may impose such additional conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property. 
3.  Any person owning real property may request, and the Director shall determine, whether such real property complies with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and of this code. Upon making such a determination, the City shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed with the County Recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division thereof complies with applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and of this code. 
4.  If the Director determines that such real property does not comply with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and of this code, the Director shall refer the matter to the Planning Commission which, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, may impose conditions as cited in subsection (H)(2) of this section. Such conditions may be fulfilled and implemented by the property owner who has applied for a certificate of compliance or by a grantee. 
5.  A certificate of compliance shall be issued for any real property which has been approved for development pursuant to this section. 
6.  A recorded final tract map or final parcel map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein. 
7.  A fee for processing an application for a certificate of compliance shall be collected by the Planning Director at the time such application is filed. Such fee shall be the same as charged for tentative parcel maps, in the case of four or less contiguous parcels, or tentative tract maps, in the case of five or more contiguous parcels.

7.  Choice of Land or Fee. 
a.  Procedure. The procedure for determining whether the subdivider is to dedicate land, pay a fee, or both, shall be as follows: 
i.  Subdivider. At the time of filing a tentative tract map for approval, the owner of the property shall, as a part of such filing, indicate whether he or she desires to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes, or whether he or she desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof. If he or she desires to dedicate land for this purpose, he or she shall designate the area thereof on the tentative tract map as submitted. 
ii.  Action of City. At the time of the tentative tract map approval, the City Council shall determine as a part of such approval whether to require a dedication of land within the subdivision, payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both. 
iii.  Prerequisites for Approval of Final Map. Where dedication is required it shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act. Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the final tract map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final tract map. 
iv.  Prerequisite for Obtaining Building Permit. When fees are required, the same shall be paid to the building department at the time of building permit issuance.

E.  Formula for Fees in Lieu of Land Dedication. 
1.  General Formula. If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the Recreational Element of the General Plan to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of residents of the subdivision, or if the proposed subdivision contains fifty (50) parcels or less, the subdivider shall, in lieu of dedication of land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in subsection D of this section, and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection G, such fee to be used for a local park which will serve the residents of the area being subdivided.

3.  Definition of Terms. Because of the fact that the City's total area is small, all public parks and recreational facilities are easily accessible to residents and are reasonably related to new subdivisions. The terms park, local park, and neighborhood park as used in this section have the same meaning, and shall be defined as any park owned by the City which is available for, and intended for use by, the general public. 
F.  Criteria for Requiring Both Dedication and Fee. ..... In subdivisions of over fifty (50) parcels, the subdivider shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in lieu thereof in accordance with the following formula: 
1.  When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed in the Recreational Element of the General Plan as a site for a local park, such proportion shall be dedicated for local park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section shall be paid for the additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection D of this section. 
2.  When a major part of the local park or recreational site has already been acquired by the City and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of subsection G of this section shall be in amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection D of this section, such fee to be used for the improvement of the existing park and recreational facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreational facilities in the area serving the subdivision. 
G.  Amount of Fee in Lieu of Land Dedication. ..... Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, such fee shall be equal to an amount for each acre which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection D of this section, which amount is the median fair market value per acre of the land in all neighborhood public parks within the City, if such land were not used for park or recreational purposes. This median market value shall be adjusted periodically to keep current with property appreciation. 
H.  Determination of Land or Fee. ..... Whether the City Council accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following:

1.  Within one (1) month of publication of the annual State Department of Finance "Orange County Population and Housing Estimates," the Planning Commission shall certify the residential vacancy rate for the City as being that rate shown in the report for San Clemente. 
2.  In the event that said vacancy rate is in excess of ten (10) percent, the City shall not restrict the number of duplex and multiple-family dwelling units that may be converted into units of a community housing project in the forthcoming year.

In the event that said vacancy rate is ten (10) percent or less, the City shall restrict the number of duplex and multiple-family dwelling units for conversion into units of a condominium project in the forthcoming year to a maximum of 25 units, plus fifty percent (50%) of the yearly average number of duplex and multiple family rental units constructed in the two years immediately preceding the vacancy certification date, with the date of such construction measured as of the date the City issues a final inspection or certificate of occupancy. In addition, no conversions shall be allowed at any time for multiple family rental units located within the Marblehead Inland, Rancho San Clemente, and Talega Specific Plan Areas. In the event that fewer than thc maximum number of units are converted in any given year, the surplus shall not be carried over to the following year. 
This section shall not apply to condominium projects involving buildings which have not been previously occupied or buildings for which the City has not issued a final inspection or certificate of occupancy for a use other than condominiums by the date the City Council approves the tentative map, and these units shall not be considered by the City Planner in calculating the number of duplex and multiple-family rental units constructed in a given fiscal year.

1.  It is the intent of the City in requiring the creation of a contingency or reserve fund for condominium projects, time share uses or projects, or other forms of independently owned dwelling units having common areas, to provide a surety for emergency repairs or restoration of such common areas and exteriors of buildings in the interests of the economic, aesthetic and environmental betterment of the City, as well as to protect the general welfare. The City does not intend to intrude into those areas regulated by the Real Estate Commissioner pursuant to the laws of the state. The sole purpose of the City Council in requiring such funds is to preserve those interests as set forth hereinabove for the entire community of the City. 
2.  The subdivider is required to deposit with the homeowners' or occupiers' association's established fund the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per unit in any planned unit development, condominium project, or time share use or project. Such deposit shall be used solely and exclusively as a contingency fund for emergencies which may arise relating to open space areas, exterior portions of dwelling units and such other restoration or repairs as may be assumed by the home owners' or occupiers' association or management corporation. 
D.  Certificate of Occupancy Required. ..... In accordance with Section 306 and Section 502 of the Uniform Building Code, no building or project which has been converted to independent ownership of the units by means of a statutory condominium or subdivision of land shall be made available for sale until the Building Official has issued a certificate of occupancy therefor.

(Ord. No. 1501, § 12, 3-16-2010; Ord. No. 1664 , § 40, 9-18-2018)  
17.04.070 - Relationship to other City documents. 
A.  General Plan. The City of San Clemente General Plan is the foundational planning policy document of the City. It defines and sets forth the basic policy and guidelines by which the community will be permitted to develop in the future. It is intended to guide all planning, environmental decisions, and development in the community. Among other things, the General Plan establishes what kinds of land uses will be permitted and where, how dense the development may be, and the proportional relationship of the built environment. 
The City's General Plan contains two elements that are physically separated from the main body of the General Plan: 1) the Coastal Element, which establishes the goals and policies for the City's coastal resources, as required by the California Coastal Act; and 2) the Housing Element, which establishes goals and policies for the City's housing stock, including affordable and senior housing, as required by State law. 
The zones and regulations included in this title are consistent with the goals and policies included in the San Clemente General Plan. 
B.  Specific and Master Plans. The Pier Bowl, West Pico Corridor, Rancho San Clemente, Forster Ranch, Marblehead Coastal and Talega Specific Plans, and the Marblehead Inland Master Plan are documents regulating development on land within the boundaries of each respective plan. The regulations included in the specific and master plans supersede regulations in this title. When regulations related to specific development are not included in the specific plans, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance apply. 
The Pier Bowl Specific Plan provides coastal zoning, development standards, design guidelines, landscape requirements, and other design standards which implement the Coastal Element policies, along with other General Plan policies, for these areas. 
A Specific plan for the North Beach Study Area is being developed. For more information regarding the City's specific plans, please refer to Chapter 17.52, Specific Plan and Study Area Zones and Standards, of this title. For more information regarding the Marblehead Inland Master Plan, please refer to Section 17.56.040, Planned Residential District Overlay. 
C.  Subdivision Ordinance. The Subdivision Ordinance, Title 16, Subdivisions, of this code, regulates the subdivision of land within the City. Many of the development projects regulated by this title are also subject to the provisions in the Subdivision Ordinance. 
D.  Urban Design Guidelines. The City's adopted Design Guidelines contain architectural and site plan guidelines which are consistent with the General Plan Urban Design Element. Projects required to receive architectural review are evaluated with respect to the Design Guidelines. 
E.  Master Landscape Plan for Scenic Corridors. The Master Landscape Plan for Scenic Corridors establishes a Unified Landscape Program for the scenic highways in San Clemente that link the existing City with four developing ranch areas. When significant improvements are made to sites located on the City's scenic corridors, projects are to be required to incorporate improvements to the public right-of-way indicated in this document. 
F.  Hillside Development Ordinance. The Hillside Development Ordinance was established to implement the goals, objectives and policies of the City's General Plan relating to the preservation and maintenance of the natural character and amenities of hillsides as a scenic resource of the City and relating to protection from geologic hazards resulting from unstable soils, erosion, and other soil problems. 
(Ord. 1304 § 9, 2005; Ord. 1185 § 3 (part), 1997; Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.04.080 - Minimum requirements and maximum limits of this title. 
The provisions of this title shall be interpreted and applied as the minimum requirements and the maximum potential limits for the protection of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, morals, and general welfare. It is recognized that each site and situation is unique and different and as such may require either exceeding the minimum acceptable requirements or achieving less than the maximum potential limits of this title. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.04.090 - Text and illustrations. 
Should any illustrations found in this title contradict the text or intent of a regulation found in this title, the text shall supersede the illustration. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.04.100 - Severability of any portion of this title. 
Should any section, subsection, clause, or provision of this title or its application to any person or circumstance for any reason be held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the validity or constitutionality of the remainder of this title and the application of those provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. This title, and each section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase of this title, would have been prepared, proposed, approved and ratified irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid or unconstitutional.

17.12.060 - Applications Requiring Additional Information. 
The City Planner, or review authority, may request the applicant submit information to clarify, amplify, correct, or otherwise supplement submitted information beyond that originally submitted in the course of processing the application should he or she find that additional information is necessary to adequately review a request. Supplemental information may include, but is not limited to, visual analysis tools such as story pole staking, photo simulations, and models. Such a request shall not invalidate the original determination that the application was complete at the time the determination was originally made. 
A.  Story Pole Staking. 
1.  Specific Projects that Require Story Pole Staking. At minimum, story pole staking is required for the following projects: 
a.  The construction or expansion of structures with the potential to affect public view corridors from public places in the Coastal Overlay zone, regardless of number of stories. 
b.  The construction or expansion of three story structures in the Architectural Overlay district. 
2.  Exemption for Time Extensions. Time extensions are exempt from story pole staking, unless the City Planner or review authority determines story poles are necessary. 
3.  General Requirements. When story poles are required, they shall be erected at least 14 calendar days prior to the first public hearing or meeting on the Project, as determined by the City Planner, except that the approval authority shall have discretion to require that they be erected earlier, but not to exceed 28 calendar days prior to the hearing. The following must be completed for a site to be deemed to have been properly staked with story poles: 
a.  Story poles and connecting thick colored lines or pennants, which accurately represent the full extent of the proposed structure, including decks and eaves, shall be constructed. The City Planner shall have final approval authority over the location of the story poles to ensure that they do not detrimentally impact the public or the then current use of the property; and 
b.  A staking plan with the location and height of the story poles must be certified as accurate by a registered land surveyor or registered civil engineer. If a complete and certified staking of story poles for a project is not in place in the time required, the project shall be continued to a later date. Neither the applicant, a relative of the applicant, nor any other person possessing a financial interest in the property or the project may certify the location and height accuracy of the staking poles. 
4.  Re-certification. Re-certification is required at least 14 calendar days prior to the first public hearing as described above in 1. Requirements, in the following instances: 
a.  If the project is modified during the design review process requiring the project to be re-staked; and/or 
b.  If the initial installation of story poles was completed one year prior to the final hearing date. 
5.  Removal. A deposit in the amount the City Planner believes to be reasonably necessary to remove the story poles shall be made prior to the time the project is scheduled for public hearing. Story poles shall be removed by the applicant within 20 calendar days after the appeal period for the project has expired. Upon timely removal of the story poles, the deposit shall be returned to the applicant. The applicant's failure to remove the story poles within the prescribed time period shall result in the automatic forfeiture of the deposit, and the City shall have the ability to access the site to remove the poles. Story poles must be removed if a project has been inactive for a period longer than six months.

When the Planning Commission is the highest review authority for a project, all review by other bodies with approval authority over the applications shall be in the form of a recommendation to the Planning Commission.

A.  Purpose and Intent . 
1.  Site Plan Permits. It is the purpose and intent of the Site Plan Permit process to provide for the review of physical improvements to a site which due to their scale, proximity to environmentally sensitive resource areas, or unique design features, require special discretionary consideration. The Site Plan Permit process is intended to encourage site and structural development which 1) respect the physical and environmental characteristics of the site, 2) ensures safe and convenient access and circulation for pedestrians and vehicles, 3) exemplifies the best professional design practices, 4) encourages individual identity for specific uses and structures, 5) encourages a distinct community or neighborhood identity, and 6) minimizes visual impacts. 
2.  Minor Site Plan Permits. It is the purpose of the Minor Site Plan Permit process to provide for the streamlined review of certain minor classes of development projects which are large enough to require discretionary consideration, but due to their scale, nature or location do not require discretionary consideration by the Planning Commission. The Minor Site Plan Permit process for major development has as its purpose the same goals for development described for the Site Plan Permit process for major development included above. 
B.  Review Authority. 
1.  Site Plan Permits. The Planning Commission is the final authority on Site Plan Permits, subject to the concurrent review and appeal provisions of Sections 17.12.090, Consideration of Concurrent Applications, and 17.12.140, Appeals of an Action. 
2.  Minor Site Plan Permits. The Zoning Administrator is the final authority on Minor Site Plan Permits, subject to the concurrent review and appeal provisions listed above. The Zoning Administrator has the discretion to refer applications to the Planning Commission for review and final action.

(Ord. No. 1548, § 3(Exh. C, §§ 5, 6), 3-6-2012; Ord. No. 1594, § 3(Exh. A, § 11), 5-5-2015)  
17.16.100 - Architectural Permits/Cultural Heritage Permits and Minor Architectural Permits/Minor Cultural Heritage Permits. 
A.  Purpose and Intent . As detailed in this section, Architectural Permits are required for different types of projects within the City, including projects affecting the City's cultural and historic resources. Because of these unique resources, the Architectural Permit process has been divided into two categories: Architectural Permits and Cultural Heritage Permits. In addition, minor versions of these permits have been established for less significant projects. 
1.  Architectural Permits and Cultural Heritage Permits. 
a.  Architectural Permits. The purpose and intent of the Architectural Permit process is to provide for architectural review of certain classes of development projects to ensure their compliance with the General Plan Urban Design Element and the City's Design Guidelines. The Architectural Permit process is intended to preserve and strengthen San Clemente's unique atmosphere as a Spanish village and to encourage: 1) architecture which is sensitive to community and neighborhood character; 2) architectural design that enhances the visual environment and protects the economic value of existing structures; and 3) site and structural development which exemplify the highest professional design standards. Architectural review shall include the consideration of a number of issues, including but not limited to, architectural style, building massing and scale, building orientation in relation to the street and parking, and building materials, textures and colors. 
b.  Cultural Heritage Permits. The purpose and intent of the architectural review with a cultural heritage emphasis is to provide for the review of projects affecting the City's cultural and/or historical resources. Along with the general goals for architectural review provided above, the process is intended to: 1) preserve and strengthen San Clemente's historic identity as a Spanish village, 2) preserve and strengthen the pedestrian-oriented areas designated in the General Plan as such, 3) preserve and protect those places, sites, buildings, structures, neighborhoods, objects, and improvements, manmade or natural, having a special historical, cultural, or architectural interest, 4) protect and enhance the City's attraction as a historic community to tourists and visitors, 5) promote the use of historic properties for the education, pleasure, and welfare of the people of the City, 6) encourage and, where specified by this title, require architecture which reflects the community's historic pedestrian-oriented character, and 7) ensure compliance with the purpose and intent of the City's Architectural Overlay District for those projects within the district. 
2.  Minor Architectural Permits and Minor Cultural Heritage Permits. 
a.  Minor Architectural Permits. The purpose of the minor architectural permit process is to provide for streamlined architectural review of certain minor classes of development projects. These projects require discretionary review to ensure their compliance with the General Plan Urban Design Element and the City's Design Guidelines. Because of their scale, however, these minor projects do not require discretionary consideration by the Planning Commission. The Minor Architectural Permit process is intended to achieve the same goals as the Architectural Permit process described in above. 
b.  Minor Cultural Heritage Permits. The purpose of the Minor Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permit process is to provide for streamlined review of minor development projects that may affect the City's cultural and/or historical resources and neighborhoods. Because of their limited scale, however, these projects do not require discretionary consideration by the Planning Commission. The Minor Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permit process has as its purpose the same goals for development described in the Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permit process described above. 
A process for waiving architectural review of projects which are extremely minor or have no potential to impact historic structures has been established. Please refer to Section 17.16.110, Staff Waivers of Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permits and Minor Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permits and Section 17.16.120, Planning Commission/Zoning Administrator Waivers of Cultural Heritage/Minor Cultural Heritage Permits, of this chapter. 
B.  Authority . 
1.  Architectural Permits and Cultural Heritage Permits. The Planning Commission is the final authority on architectural/cultural heritage permits, subject to the concurrent review and appeal provisions of Section 17.12.090, Consideration of Concurrent Applications and Section 17.12.140, Appeals of an Action. 
2.  Minor Architectural Permits and Minor Cultural Heritage Permits. The Zoning Administrator is the final authority on minor architectural/cultural heritage permits, subject to the concurrent review and appeal provisions of Section 17.12.090, Consideration of Concurrent Applications, and Section 17.12.140, Appeals of an Action. The Zoning Administrator has the discretion to refer application to the Planning Commission for review and final action. 
C.  Applicability .

If the STLU property is held in trust, including in a living trust, then, for purpose of this subsection, ownership terminates upon a change of the primary beneficiary or beneficiaries. If a property owner or owners transfer ownership of a property into a trust, a change of ownership will not be deemed to have occurred as long as every primary beneficiary of the trust was also an owner of the property before the transfer.

Within 30 calendar days of application filing, the applicant is notified if their application is complete or if information is needed to complete the application and resume the review process. The Development Management Team also makes comments and recommendations to provide helpful information to applicants and notify them when a proposal does not comply with development standards policies, regulations, and guidelines. 
b.  Environmental Review . After an application is complete the project shall be reviewed in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act to determine if environmental studies are required. If studies are required, then they shall be completed at the applicant's expense, which may require consultant services.

1.  The proposed use is permitted within the subject zone pursuant to the approval of a STAR permit and complies with all the applicable provisions of this title, the San Clemente General Plan, and the purpose and intent of the zone in which the use is being proposed. 
2.  The site is suitable for the type and intensity of use that is proposed. 
3.  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the public health safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties and improvements in the vicinity. 
4.  The proposed use will not negatively impact surrounding land uses. 
5.  The use meets the minimum operating and development standards of Subsections 17.28.292E. and F. 
6.  The STAR qualifies for an STLU operating license pursuant to Chapter 3.24. 
H.  Recordation . As a condition of every STLU zoning permit the STLU owner must cause to be recorded with the County ClerkRecorder, at the owner's expense a "CITY'S RIGHT TO NOTICE OF CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP" covenant. It must state that the property owner covenants to give the City notice of any change in ownership upon conveyance of the property. Notice must be by the owner or by the owner's escrow agent. The STLU zoning permit is void as of the date of conveyance. 
I.  Modifications Requested by the Applicant . Modifications to approved STAR permits shall be reviewed in accordance with Section 17.12.180, Modifications of an Approved Application. 
J.  Modifications or Revocations Initiated by the City . The City may change or revoke STLU zoning permits as provided in Section 17.12.175 of this code.

L.  Approval Does Not Run with the Land . A STAR permit is owner-specific and does not run with the land. Any change of ownership terminates an existing STLU zoning permit and requires a new STLU zoning permit to be issued to the new owner for continued operation of the STLU. A change of ownership shall include but not be limited to the sale of at least 50 percent of the shares in any type of corporation or a change in any of the principal officers in a corporation as determined by the City Manager or his or her designee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the permittee is a partnership and one or more of the partners should withdraw, one or more of the remaining partners may acquire by purchase, or otherwise, the interest of the partner or partners who withdrew without effecting a change in ownership, and in such case the permittee shall be deemed to be the surviving partner(s). If the STLU property is held in trust, including in a living trust, then, for purpose of this subsection, ownership terminates upon a change of the primary beneficiary or beneficiaries. If a property owner or owners transfer ownership of a property into a trust, a change of ownership will not be deemed to have occurred as long as every primary beneficiary of the trust was also an owner of the property before the transfer.

Applications may be submitted during or after the pre-application review conference. 
4.  Following receipt of a completed application, the City Planner shall schedule a meeting with the property owner at the subject property (the "site meeting"). The purpose and intent of the site meeting is to inspect the property to determine compliance with the criteria specified in Section 17.16.160(E) of this chapter and to develop a list of improvements, if any, deemed necessary during the first 10-year period of the Agreement to restore the property's architectural and/or historical integrity. After the site meeting, a follow-up meeting may be scheduled by the City Planner with the property owner to estimate the potential property tax savings for the individual property. However, actual property tax savings will be calculated by the County Tax Assessor each tax year. The City's estimate is no more than a simple estimate and not intended by the City to represent the actual tax savings any person may experience. No person should rely on City representatives regarding the potential tax savings resulting from the execution of an Historic Property Preservation Agreement when such person is contemplating entering into such an agreement. Any person seeking to understand the tax consequences of entering into the Agreement should consult his/her tax expert. 
5.  Once the site meeting has been completed and a list of necessary improvements, if any, has been drafted for the property, the City Planner shall forward the draft Agreement, and the proposed list of improvements, to the Design Review Subcommittee for review. The Subcommittee shall consider the proposed list of improvements, may make recommendations for amendments to said list, and shall make a recommendation to the City Council regarding approval or denial of the Agreement together with the proposed list of improvements. 
6.  Following receipt of a recommendation on the Agreement together with the proposed list of improvements, the City Council shall conduct a public hearing in compliance with Section 17.12.100, Public Hearing and Notification, of this title. 
7.  After completion of the public hearing, the City Council shall either approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the request. 
8.  Once an Historic Property Preservation Agreement has been approved by the City Council, the property owner shall pay the fee for processing the application to the City Planning Division. Once the applicable fee has been paid, the approved Agreement shall be executed by the property owner(s) and the City with notarized signatures. The City shall forward all Agreements properly executed during a given calendar year to the County Recorder's office for recordation within 20 days after the execution date. The recorded copy will be returned to the City for submission to the County Tax Assessor's office for implementation. In accordance with state law, no properly executed Historic Property Preservation Agreement may take effect until it has been recorded and submitted to the County Tax Assessor's office. Each Historic Property Preservation Agreement recorded before January 20 of a calendar year will take effect for property tax reduction purposes in the tax year beginning July of that calendar year. 
H.  Approval Runs with the Land. The approval of an Historic Property Preservation Agreement shall run with the land, and shall continue to be valid upon a change of ownership of the site to which it applies. 
I.  Notice of Nonrenewal. Either party to an Historic Property Preservation Agreement may file a notice of nonrenewal at any time after entering into the Agreement. The effect of the Notice of Nonrenewal is that the Agreement will become null and void upon expiration of the 10-year term in effect at the time the Notice is filed. 
J.  Cancellation of Agreement. 
1.  The City Council may cancel an Historic Property Preservation Agreement if the City Council determines that the property owner has breached any of the terms of the Agreement, or has allowed the property to deteriorate to the extent that it no longer meets the criteria in Section 17.16.160(E)(1). 
2.  Following completion of the Enforcement of Agreement procedures contained within each Historic Property Preservation Agreement and prior to the cancellation of an Historic Property Preservation Agreement, the City Council may initiate and review cancellation of an Agreement in the same manner as revocation of a Site Plan Permit, as described in Section 17.12.180, Initiating Review of a Site Plan Permit and Review Procedures. 
3.  If the City Council cancels an Agreement, the property owner shall pay a penalty of 12½ percent of the full value of the property, as determined by the County Tax Assessor, to the State.

17.24.050 - Building Equipment and Services and Their Screening. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The location of trash enclosures and mechanical and other similar types of equipment on private property can significantly affect the visual quality of a project. Particularly important is the view of projects and their related equipment and services from adjacent streets. Because of San Clemente's varied topography, views of roof-mounted equipment need to be considered, as well. The requirements of this subsection are meant to address the negative visual impacts resulting from the location of trash enclosures and mechanical equipment on private property, while recognizing that they are necessary aspects of development. The requirements of this section are supplemented by the City's Design Guidelines, which contain guidelines for the treatment of building equipment and services. 
B.  Trash Enclosures. Trash enclosures which enclose dumpsters shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the trash and recyclable materials generated by the uses on the parcel(s) being served. All outdoor storage of trash, garbage, refuse, and other items or material intended for discarding or collection shall be screened from public view on at least three sides by a solid wall, constructed of concrete block, compatible with the project's architecture and shall not be less than five feet in height or, alternatively, such other material or design approved by the appropriate decision making authority. The fourth side shall contain an opaque gate which shall be constructed of steel frame, be maintained in working order, and remain closed except when in use. The minimum dimensions of a trash enclosure which encloses a dumpster shall be nine feet wide by six feet deep. 
C.  Ground and Roof-Mounted Equipment. 
1.  Ground-Mounted Equipment on Private Property. Where feasible, ground-mounted equipment, such as air conditioning units, landscape irrigation's controls, transformers, fuse boxes, telephone equipment, gas meters, water meters, stand pipes, and fire sprinkler connectors, shall be located as follows: 
a.  Underground; or 
b.  Outside the front yard setback and, when no front yard setback is required outside the area between the street and the building closest to the street. 
Where it is infeasible to locate ground-mounted equipment outside the front yard, ground-mounted equipment located in the front yard shall be screened from public view. Screening of ground-mounted equipment must be similar to adjacent landscaping, architecture and/or materials. 
2.  Roof-Mounted Equipment. All roof-mounted appurtenances including, but not limited to air conditioning units, and mechanical equipment shall be shielded and architecturally screened from view from on-site parking areas, adjacent public streets and adjacent residentially zoned property as follows: 
a.  All roof-mounted equipment shall be located in an equipment well which is screened by a screening wall, parapet wall or equipment well. The height of such equipment, mounted in the well, shall not exceed the height of the architectural element used to screen the well. Viewsheds and sightlines shall be taken into consideration and the equipment should be placed in a location, which effects maximum screening. The Planning Division may also require additional screening devices in conjunction with tenant improvements as deemed necessary where the screening wall, parapet wall or equipment well does not provide adequate screening from the above-referred views. 
b.  Roof screens shall be sheathed in a matching or complementary material to the exterior building and may include metal panels, parapet walls or screens constructed of exterior grade plywood or other durable materials. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)

C.  Standards. 
1.  Inland Canyon Lots with an RL Designation. The canyon setback for development on noncoastal canyon lots shall be established by the City Planner, after an on-site visit by Planning Division staff and depending upon site characteristics, and shall be one of the following: 
a.  A minimum of 30 percent of the depth of the lot; or 
b.  In accordance with house and deck/patio stringlines drawn between the nearest corners of adjacent structures. 
2.  Inland Canyon Lots with a Combination RL/OS Designation. New construction on inland canyon lots which have both a residential and an open space designation shall comply with the setback standards for lots with an RL designation, as detailed in Subdivision 1 of this subsection. 
3.  Inland Canyon Lots with an RVL Designation. New construction on inland canyon lots with an RVL designation requires discretionary review, as described in Table 17.32.030, Residential Zone Uses, and Table 17.32.040, Residential Zone Development Standards. Through discretionary review, the standards listed in Subsection (C)(1), Inland Canyon Lots with an RL Designation, shall be used to guide development within these lots, which are often located entirely within inland canyons. The primary factor guiding development on these lots shall be to avoid development within the canyon, when feasible. When there is no other feasible location for development but within a canyon, development shall minimize topographical and aesthetic impacts upon the canyon and adjacent residential development, as determined through the prescribed discretionary review process. 
4.  Inland Canyon Lots with an OS Designation. New construction on inland canyon lots with an OS designation requires discretionary review, as described in Table 17.44.020, Permitted and Conditional Uses within Open Space Zones, and Table 17.44.030, Open Space Zone Development Standards. Through discretionary review, the standards listed in Subsection (C)(1), Inland Canyon Lots with an RL Designation, shall be used to guide development within these lots, which are often located entirely within inland canyons. The primary factor guiding development on these lots shall be to avoid development within the canyon, when feasible. When there is no other feasible location for development but within a canyon, development shall minimize topographical and aesthetic impacts upon the canyon and adjacent residential development, as determined through the prescribed discretionary review process.

17.24.070 - Density Bonuses and Other Incentives for Affordable and Senior Housing Projects. 
A.  Purpose and Intent . The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of Government Code Sections 65915, 65915.5, 65915.7 and the City's Housing Element regarding the provision of density bonuses and other regulatory incentives for affordable and senior housing projects. 
B.  Applicability . The provisions of this section shall apply to projects qualifying for density bonuses provided for by Government Code Sections 65915, 65915.5 and 65915.7, in accordance with subsection (C) of this section. 
C.  Standards . 
1.  City Obligation To Provide Density Bonuses and Incentives . When an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development within, or for the donation of land for housing within the City, the City shall provide the applicant with incentives or concessions for the production of housing units and child care facilities as prescribed in this Section. 
2.  Development Entitled To Bonuses and Incentives . 
(a)  The City shall grant one density bonus, the amount of which shall be as specified in subdivision C.6, and incentives or concessions, as described in subdivision C.4, waivers or reductions of development standards, as described in subsection C.4.b, and parking ratios, as described in subdivision C.10 when an applicant for a housing development seeks and agrees to construct a housing development, excluding any units permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this section, that will contain at least any one of the following: 
(i)  Ten percent of the total units of a housing development for lower income households, as defined in Section 50079.5 of the Health and Safety Code. 
(ii)  Five percent of the total units of a housing development for very low income households, as defined in Section 50105 of the Health and Safety Code. 
(iii)  A senior citizen housing development, as defined in Sections 51.3 and 51.12 of the Civil Code and reprinted in subparagraph C.9(g) below, or a mobilehome park that limits residency based on age requirements for housing for older persons pursuant to Section 798.76 or 799.5 of the Civil Code. 
(iv)  Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a common interest development, as defined in Section 4100 of the Civil Code, for persons and families of moderate income, as defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code, provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase. 
(v)  Ten percent of the total units of a housing development for transitional foster youth, as defined in Section 66025.9 of the Education Code, disabled veterans, as defined in Section 18541, or homeless persons, as defined in the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The units described in this subparagraph shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction of 55 years and shall be provided at the same affordability level as very low income units. 
(b)  For purposes of calculating the amount of the density bonus pursuant to subdivision C.6, the applicant who requests a density bonus pursuant to this Section 17.24 shall elect whether the bonus shall be awarded on the basis of subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of paragraph C.2(a) above. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, "total units" or "total dwelling units" does not include units added by a density bonus awarded pursuant to this section. 
3.  Term of Affordability and Resale . 
(a)  An applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure, continued affordability of all low- and very low income rental units that qualified the applicant for the award of the density bonus for 55 years or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program. Rents for the lower income density bonus units shall be set at an affordable rent as defined in Section 50053 of the Health and Safety Code. 
(b)  An applicant shall agree to, and the City shall ensure, the initial occupant of all for-sale units that qualified the applicant for the award of the density bonus are persons and families of very low, low, or moderate income, as required, and the units shall be offered at an affordable housing cost, as that cost is defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code. The City shall enforce an equity sharing agreement, unless it is in conflict with the requirements of another public funding source or law. The following apply to the equity sharing agreement: 
(i)  Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation. The City shall recapture any initial subsidy, as defined in subparagraph C.3(b)(ii), and its proportionate share of appreciation, as defined in subparagraph C.3(b)(iii), which amount shall be used within five years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of Section 33334.2 of the Health and Safety Code that promote home ownership. 
(ii)  For purposes of this subdivision, the City's initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sale price to the moderate-income household, plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value. 
(iii)  For purposes of this subdivision, the City's proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the City's initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale. 
(c)  An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives or concessions under this section if the housing development is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental dwelling units are or, if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished in the five-year period preceding the application, have been subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income; subject to any other form of rent or price control through a public entity's valid exercise of its police power; or occupied by lower or very low income households, unless the proposed housing development replaces those units, and either of the following applies: 
(i)  The proposed housing development, inclusive of the units replaced pursuant to this paragraph, contains affordable units at the percentages set forth in subdivision (b). 
(ii)  Each unit in the development, exclusive of a manager's unit or units, is affordable to, and occupied by, either a lower or very low income household. 
(d)  For the purposes of this paragraph, "replace" shall mean either of the following: 
(i)  If any dwelling units described in subparagraph 3(c) are occupied on the date of application, the proposed housing development shall provide at least the same number of units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those households in occupancy. If the income category of the household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that lower income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of lower income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. For unoccupied dwelling units described in subparagraph 3(c) in a development with occupied units, the proposed housing development shall provide units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as the last household in occupancy. If the income category of the last household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that lower income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of lower income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. If the replacement units will be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction for at least 55 years. If the proposed development is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject to paragraph (2). 
(ii)  If all dwelling units described in subparagraph 3(c) have been vacated or demolished within the five-year period preceding the application, the proposed housing development shall provide at least the same number of units of equivalent size as existed at the highpoint of those units in the five-year period preceding the application to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those persons and families in occupancy at that time, if known. If the incomes of the persons and families in occupancy at the highpoint is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that low-income and very low income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of low-income and very low income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. If the replacement units will be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction for at least 55 years. If the proposed development is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject to paragraph (2). 
(e)  Notwithstanding subparagraph 3(d), for any dwelling unit described in subparagraph 3(c) that is or was, within the five-year period preceding the application, subject to a form of rent or price control through a local government's valid exercise of its police power and that is or was occupied by persons or families above lower income, the City may do either of the following: 
(i)  Require that the replacement units be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, low-income persons or families. If the replacement units will be rental dwelling units, these units shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction for at least 55 years. If the proposed development is for-sale units, the units replaced shall be subject to paragraph 3(b). 
(ii)  Require that the units be replaced in compliance with the jurisdiction's rent or price control ordinance, provided that each unit described in subparagraph 3(b) is replaced. Unless otherwise required by the jurisdiction's rent or price control ordinance, these units shall not be subject to a recorded affordability restriction. 
(f)  For purposes of this paragraph, "equivalent size" means that the replacement units contain at least the same total number of bedrooms as the units being replaced. 
(g)  Subparagraph 3(b) does not apply to an applicant seeking a density bonus for a proposed housing development if his or her application was submitted to, or processed by the City before January 1, 2015. 
4.  Regulatory Incentives and Concessions . 
(a)  An applicant for a density bonus pursuant to subdivision C.2 may submit to the City a proposal for the specific incentives or concessions that the applicant requests pursuant to this section, and may request a meeting with the City. If the City approves the project, the City shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant unless the City makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of any of the following: 
(i)  The concession or incentive does not result in identifiable and actual cost reductions, consistent with subdivision (b) of this section, to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in subdivision C.3. 
(ii)  The concession or incentive would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety or upon the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. As used in this paragraph, a "specific, adverse impact" means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete. Inconsistency with the zoning ordinance or general plan land use designation shall not constitute a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety. 
(iii)  The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section, a concession or incentive means any of the following: 
(i)  A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be required that results in identifiable and actual cost reductions, to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in subdivision 3(a). 
(ii)  Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing project will be located. 
(iii)  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the City that result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in subdivision 3(a). 
(iv)  Density bonus in excess of that to which a housing project is otherwise entitled, provided that the City Council makes all of the following findings: 
a.  the project provides 100 percent affordability; 
b.  the project site is deed restricted to ensure affordability for at least 55 years; 
c.  the project is located on a legal, conforming lot, has a total site area of less than one acre and is located within residential, commercial or mixed-use zones pursuant to the allowable uses for affordable or senior housing of the applicable chapter; 
d.  with the added density bonus, the project will be architecturally compatible with surrounding development; and 
e.  the project otherwise complies with Zoning Ordinance requirements for the zone in which it is located. 
f.  the project site is owned by the City of San Clemente or by a 501(c)3 non-profit housing provider under agreement with the City of San Clemente, for the purpose of providing affordable housing. 
(c)  The applicant shall receive the following number of incentives or concessions: 
(i)  One incentive or concession for projects that include at least 10 percent of the total units for lower income households, at least five percent for very low income households, or at least 10 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development. 
(ii)  Two incentives or concessions for projects that include at least 20 percent of the total units for lower income households, at least 10 percent for very low income households, or at least 20 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development. 
(iii)  Three incentives or concessions for projects that include at least 30 percent of the total units for lower income households, at least 15 percent for very low income households, or at least 30 percent for persons and families of moderate income in a common interest development. 
(d)  The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. For purposes of this subdivision, "study" does not include reasonable documentation to establish eligibility for the concession or incentive or to demonstrate that the incentive or concession meets the definition set forth in Section 4.b, above. Except as provided in Sections 4.a and 5.a, the granting of a density bonus shall not require or be interpreted to require the waiver of a City ordinance or provisions of a City ordinance unrelated to development standards. 
(e)  This Subdivision C.4 does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the City, or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. 
5.  Prohibition Against Applying Development Standards that Impede Development at Density Bonus Levels . 
(a)  The City shall not apply any development standard that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of subdivision C.2 at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this section. An applicant may submit to the City a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of subdivision C.2 at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted under this section, and may request a meeting with the City. Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require the City to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in subparagraph C.4(a)(ii) above upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. In addition, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the City to waive or reduce development standards that would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, or to grant any waiver or reduction that would be contrary to state or federal law. 
(b)  A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this subdivision shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to subdivision C.4. 
6.  Calculation of Density Bonus . The amount of density bonus to which the applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the percentage established in subdivision C.2. 
(a)  For housing developments meeting the criteria of C.2(a)(i), the density bonus shall be calculated as follows: 
Percentage
Low-Income Units 	Percentage

(e)  All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. The granting of a density bonus shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
(f)  For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the residential units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the units for the lower income households are located. 
7.  Density Bonus for Donation of Land to City . 
(a)  When an applicant for a tentative subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development approval donates land to the City in accordance with this subdivision, the applicant shall be entitled to a 15-percent increase above the otherwise maximum allowable residential density for the entire development, as follows: 
Percentage
Very Low Income Units 	Percentage
Density Bonus 
10 	15 
11 	16 
12 	17

27 	32 
28 	33 
29 	34 
30 	35 
 
(b)  This increase shall be in addition to any increase in density mandated by subdivision C.2, up to a maximum combined mandated density increase of 35 percent if an applicant seeks an increase pursuant to both this subdivision and subdivision C.2. All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the City's authority to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development. An applicant shall be eligible for the increased density bonus described in this subdivision if all of the following conditions are met: 
(i)  The applicant donates and transfers the land no later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application; 
(ii)  The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred are sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very low income households in an amount not less than 10 percent of the number of residential units of the proposed development; 
(iii)  The transferred land is at least one acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of at least 40 units, has the appropriate general plan designation, is appropriately zoned with appropriate development standards for development at a density of at least 30 units per acre, and is or will be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure; 
(iv)  The transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the development of the very low income housing units on the transferred land, not later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application, except that the City may subject the proposed development to subsequent design review to the extent authorized by subdivision (i) of California Government Code Section 65583.2 if the design has not been reviewed by the City prior to the time of transfer; 
(v)  The transferred land and the affordable units shall be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision C.3, which shall be recorded on the property at the time of the transfer; 
(vi)  The land is transferred to the City or to a City-approved housing developer. The City may require the applicant to identify and transfer the land to the approved housing developer; 
(vii)  The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed development or, if the City agrees, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed development; and 
(viii)  A proposed source of funding for the very low income units shall be identified not later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application. 
8.  Density Bonus for Provision of Child Care Facilities in Qualifying Housing Development . 
(a)  When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that conforms to the requirements of subdivision C.2 and includes a child care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to, the project, the City shall grant either of the following: 
(i)  An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of square feet in the child care facility; or 
(ii)  An additional concession or incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility. 
(b)  The City shall require, as a condition of approving the housing development, that the following occur: 
(i)  The child care facility shall remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the density bonus units are required to remain affordable pursuant to subdivision C.3; and 
(ii)  Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low income households, lower income households, or families of moderate income shall equal a percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of dwelling units that are required for very low income households, lower income households, or families of moderate income pursuant to subdivision C.2. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any requirement of this subdivision, the City shall not be required to provide a density bonus or concession for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities. 
9.  Definitions . For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
(a)  "Affordable" shall mean residential rent costs or sales prices which conform to the standards issued by the State Department of Housing and Community Development and updated periodically to reflect state and/or federal housing cost indices. 
(b)  "Affordable Housing Project" shall mean a development project which meets the standards in Chapter 17.56.090 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(c)  "Child care facility" means a child day care facility other than a family day care home, including, but not limited to, infant centers, preschools, extended day care facilities, and school age child care centers. 
(d)  "Density bonus" means a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density as of the date of application by the applicant to the City or, if elected by the applicant, a lesser percentage of density increase, including, but not limited to, no increase in density. The amount of density increase to which the applicant is entitled shall vary according to the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the percentage established in subdivision 2(a). 
(e)  "Development standard" includes a site or construction condition, including, but not limited to, a height limitation, a setback requirement, a floor area ratio, an onsite open-space requirement, or a parking ratio that applies to a residential development pursuant to any ordinance, general plan element, specific plan, or other City condition, law, policy, resolution, or regulation. 
(f)  "Housing development" means a development project for five or more residential units, including mixed-use developments. For the purposes of this section, "housing development" also includes a subdivision or common interest development, as defined in Section 4100 of the Civil Code, approved by the City, and consists of residential units or unimproved residential lots and either a project to substantially rehabilitate and convert an existing commercial building to residential use or the substantial rehabilitation of an existing multifamily dwelling, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 65863.4, where the result of the rehabilitation would be a net increase in available residential units. For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the residential units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the units for the lower income households are located. 
(g)  "Maximum allowable residential density" means the density allowed under the City's zoning ordinance and the Land Use Element of the City's General Plan, or, if a range of density is permitted, the maximum allowable density for the specific zoning range and land use designation in the General Plan applicable to the project. Where the density allowed under the zoning ordinance is inconsistent with the density allowed under the Land Use Element of the General Plan, the General Plan density shall prevail.

(i)  "Senior citizen housing development" means a residential development developed, substantially rehabilitated, or substantially renovated for, senior citizens that has at least 35 dwelling units. 
10.  Parking Incentives. 
(a)  The City shall not require the parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, for a housing development meeting the criteria of subdivision C.2 to exceed the following ratios: 
(i)  Zero to one bedroom: one onsite parking space. 
(ii)  Two to three bedrooms: two onsite parking spaces. 
(iii)  Four and more bedrooms: two and one-half parking spaces. 
(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if a development includes the maximum percentage of low-income or very low income units provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision (6) and is located within one-half mile of a major transit stop, as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 21155 of the Public Resources Code, and there is unobstructed access to the major transit stop from the development, then, upon the request of the developer, the City shall not impose a vehicular parking ratio, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, that exceeds 0.5 spaces per bedroom.

17.24.090 - Fences, Walls and Hedges. 
A.  Purpose and Intent . The purpose and intent of this section is to establish standards for fences, walls and hedges that limit their visual and traffic impacts, but allow for the privacy and architectural interest afforded by such structures. The purpose of a stricter fence height limit in the front yard is to provide for an open street scene, to allow the primary structures on a street to be visible and to contribute to the visual character of the neighborhood, and to allow for unobstructed views of traffic to and from driveways. 
B.  Standards for Fences, Walls, and Hedges in All Zones . 
1.  Maintenance. Fences, Walls or Hedges shall be constructed and maintained so that they do not constitute a hazard to traffic, persons or property. 
2.  Prohibited Types of Fences. Barbed wire and razor fences are prohibited in all zones, except when such materials are needed to restrict access to public utility equipment such as high voltage transformers. 
3.  Measuring Height. The height of fences, hedges and walls and all structural elements supporting fences, walls and hedges, including pilasters, trellises, etc., shall be measured from the lower side of finished grade to the top of the fence, hedge or wall. 
C.  Standards for Fences, Walls and Hedges in Residential Zones . 
1.  Height Limits. Table 17.24.090 provides the maximum height limit for fences, walls, and hedges in residential zones. In front yards and portions of street side yards, fences, walls and hedges have a stricter height limit to maintain an open street scene, preserve the visibility of primary structures; enhance neighborhood character, and provide unobstructed views of traffic to and from driveways.

2.  Exceptions. 
a.  A Minor Exception Permit is required to allow the height of a fence, wall or hedge in front yards and street side yard setback areas (within five feet of property line) to be increased to a maximum of six feet per Section 17.16.080, Minor Exception Permits. 
b.  A Conditional Use Permit is required to allow the height of a fence, wall, or hedge in the rear half of a lot to exceed six feet when the fence, wall, or hedge encloses tennis courts, other similar recreational areas, or private screened outdoor areas, per Section 17.16.060, Conditional Use Permits. 
c.  Required Findings. In addition to the general findings required for permits, the following specific findings shall be made to allow height exceptions for fences, walls, or hedges: 
i.  The height of the fence, wall or hedge will not be unsightly or incompatible with the character of or uses in the neighborhood; 
ii.  The height of the fence, wall, or hedge will not have negative visual impacts upon the street scene or obstruct views of traffic to and from driveways. 
D.  Standards for Fences, Walls and Hedges in Nonresidential Zones . In nonresidential zones, fences, walls, and hedges shall comply with the following requirements: 
1.  Height and Materials. The height limit and other features of fences, walls, and hedges are reviewed and approved through the discretionary review process per Section 17.16.100. 
2.  Fencing Around Parking Areas. For requirements for fencing around parking lots, please refer to Section 17.28.220, Parking Lots.

17.24.110 - Height Limitations. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. One of San Clemente's defining characteristics is its varied topography. The City's building height regulations are intended to: 
1.  Preserve the natural topography by encouraging residential structures that follow the topography of the lots on which they are located and by discouraging significant grading or fill on infill lots. The calculation of height by individual roof element is intended to assist these objectives, by allowing roof elements to step up or down with the natural topography of the lot. The measurement of height from original grade is also intended to assist these objectives, by establishing height limits which are relative to the natural topography; 
2.  Accommodate the special difficulties of developing on sloped properties by allowing height to be averaged within roof elements; 
3.  Encourage developments with full roofs. The establishment of a height limit to plate line and a height limit to top of roof, in specific mixed-use and nonresidential zones where traditional architecture is required, is intended to assist with this objective; and 
4.  Discourage excessively massive structures. The establishment of a story limit in mixed-use and nonresidential zones is intended to assist with this objective. The exemption of subterranean portions of structures from counting toward the story limit is intended to assist this objective, as well. 
B.  General Regulations for the Measurement of Height. The following regulations for calculating height shall apply to all development within the City of San Clemente: 
1.  Measurement of Height From Original or Finished Grade. 
a.  Developments With Mass Recontouring. In the case of subdivisions and/or land development where mass recontouring has been or will be permitted by the City, building height shall be measured from finished grade, subject to approval through the site plan permit process, as described in Section 17.16.050, Site Plan Permits and Minor Site Plan Permits, of this title. Please refer to Figure 17.24.110A for a map of those areas in the City which have had mass recontouring. This subsection does not include properties with significant grading which have received the approval of a variance from height limits; please refer to the following paragraph b, for the method of measuring height on these properties. 
b.  All Other Development. In the case of developments where mass recontouring has not been permitted, or where significant grading has been allowed but through the approval of a variance from the height limit, building height shall be measured from original grade. 
c.  In cases where it is ambiguous whether building height should be measured from finished or original grade, or where a determination of finished or original grade is difficult, the City Planner shall make such determination, subject to the appeal provisions in Section 17.12.140, Appeals of an Action, of this title. 
2.  Measurement of Height by Roof Element. The building height limits for a zone shall be applied to and measured for each roof element of a structure. No individual roof element may exceed the height limits for the zone. 
3.  Measurement of Height to the Top of a Roof Element (TOR). Unless additional height limits are indicated in the development standard tables in Chapters 17.32, Residential Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards, of this title, the maximum height limit stated for a zone shall be a limit upon the "average height to the top of the roof element." The average height to the top of a roof element is calculated by: 
a.  Measuring the height of each corner of the roof element. The height of each corner of the roof element is the vertical distance between original or finished grade and a projection of the top of the roof element, at each corner. Please refer to Subsection (B)(1), Measurement of Height from Original or Finished Grade, of this section, regarding whether original or finished grade should be used; and 
b.  Averaging the sum of the height of each corner of the roof element. 
C.  Height Limits in Residential Zones. 
1.  Height Limits. The maximum building height limits for structures in residential zones are described in Table 17.32.040, Residential Zone Development Standards, of this title. 
Figure 17.24.110A 
 
 
Figure 17.24.110B 
 
2.  Measurement of Height. Structures in residential zones must comply with the general regulations for measuring height in Subsection (B), General Regulations for the Measurement of Height, of this section. 
D.  Height Limits in Nonresidential and Mixed-Use Zones. 
1.  Height Limits. The maximum building height limits for structures in nonresidential and mixed-use zones are described in the development standard tables in Chapters 17.36, Commercial Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards, of this title. Maximum building height limits for nonresidential and mixed-use structures are expressed in terms of both numerical height limits and a story limit; structures must comply with all the height limits for the zone. 
2.  Measurement of Height. Please refer to the general regulations for the measurement of height in Subsection (B), General Regulations for the Measurement of Height, of this section. In addition to compliance with the general regulations above, height in non-residential and mixed-use zones shall, when required in Chapters 17.36, Commercial Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards, comply with the following regulations: 
a.  Story Limits. The number of stories in each roof element shall not exceed the story limit for each zone, as indicated in Chapters 17.36, Commercial Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards. The following may be excepted from the story limits of this subsection: 
i.  Residential structures in the MU 5.1 zone do not have story limits; 
ii.  Basements shall not be counted toward the story limits for a structure. 
b.  Height Limit to Plateline (PL). For zones specified in the development standard tables, as required in Chapters 17.36, Commercial Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards, of this title, a height limit to the plateline of a roof has been established. The height of the plate line of a roof element shall be a measurement of the "average height of the plateline." The average height of the plate line of the roof element is calculated as follows: 
i.  Measuring the height to the plate line at each corner of the roof element. The height to the plate line at each corner of the roof element is the vertical distance between original or finished grade and the plate line, at each corner. Please refer to Subsection (B)(1), Measurement of Height from Original or Finished Grade, of this section, regarding whether original or finished grade should be used; and 
ii.  Averaging the sum of the heights to the plate line at each corner of the roof element. 
iii.  Plate Line is defined as the top of the highest horizontal framing member or solid wall of a building or structure or part thereof, upon which roof beams or ceiling rafters rest. Features excluded from measurement under this definition shall include gable ends, sloping roofs, parapet walls and other vertical extensions which are normally controlled by limits on roof height as set forth in this section. 
E.  Visual Analysis Tools. The City Planner and review authority may require the submittal of visual analysis tools to evaluate visual impacts of projects that require a discretionary permit application. Visual analysis tools may include, but are not limited to, story pole staking, visual simulations, models, etc. Refer to Section 17.12.060.

17.24.180 - Retaining Walls. 
A.  Purpose and Intent . In a community with sloping topography, retaining walls are often necessary to create developable or usable areas. The purpose and intent of this section is to establish standards that allow for retaining walls, while limiting their visual and traffic impacts. The purpose of a stricter height limit in the front yard is to provide for an open street scene, to allow the primary structures on a street to be visible and to contribute to the visual character of the neighborhood, and to allow for unobstructed views of traffic to and from driveways. The standards are also meant to minimize the height of retaining walls and their impacts upon adjacent structures. 
B.  Standards for Retaining Walls In All Zones . 
1.  Construction and Maintenance. Retaining walls shall be constructed and maintained so that they do not constitute a hazard to traffic, persons or property. 
2.  Measuring Height. The height of retaining walls shall be measured from the lower side of finished grade to the top of the retaining wall. 
C.  Standards for Retaining Walls In Nonresidential Zones . The height limit, design, materials, stepping, and other retaining wall features of retaining walls are reviewed and approved through the discretionary review process. A Minor Architectural Permit or Minor Cultural Heritage Permit is required to allow retaining walls per Section 17.16.100. 
D.  Standards for Retaining Walls In Residential Zones. Unless otherwise provided for in the applicable zones, the following standards shall apply to retaining walls and to all structural elements supporting the retaining walls, including pilasters, trellises, etc. In addition to the regulations set forth in this section, all retaining walls shall be constructed and maintained so that they do not constitute a hazard to traffic, persons or property. 
1.  Height Limits. The maximum height limits for residential retaining walls are shown in Table 17.24.180, Height Limits for Residential Retaining Walls, below. 
Table 17.24.180 
Height Limits for Residential Retaining Walls 
Area of Lot 	Maximum Height Limit 
Front Yard 
Setback Area 	3 ft. 6 in. 
Interior Side Yard 
Setback Area 	6 ft., except when the retaining wall faces toward the subject property, in which case the retaining wall shall not exceed 8 ft. 6 in. in height. 
Street-Side Yard 
Setback Area 	Reverse comer lot 3 ft. 6 in. Corner lot: Within 5 ft. of street-side property line: 3 ft. 6 in. Remaining width of the street side yard: 6 ft. 
Rear Yard 
Setback Area 	6 ft., except when the retaining wall faces toward the subject property, in which case the retaining wall shall not exceed 8 ft. 6 in. in height. 
Other Areas of Lot 	6 ft., except when the retaining wall faces toward the subject property, in which case the retaining wall shall not exceed 8 ft. 6 in. in height. 
 
2.  Stepping of Retaining Walls. A number of retaining walls (stepping) may be constructed to substitute for one tall retaining wall if both of the following occur: 
a.  The height of each retaining wall must comply with the height limits of Table 17.24.180, Height Limits for Retaining Walls, above; and 
b.  The minimum distance between any two retaining walls shall be equal to or greater than the height of the taller of the two retaining walls. The distance between the two walls shall be measured as the horizontal separation between the two closest wall faces: the back face of the downslope retaining wall and the front face of the up slope retaining wall. 
Figure 17.24.180
 
3.  Guardrail Requirements. 
a.  Guardrail Height. The height of guardrails shall comply with the Building Code. The height is measured from the top of the retaining wall to the top of the guardrail. When swimming pools are proposed, the height of the guardrails shall be no higher than the minimum height required by the Swimming Pool Code. 
b.  Materials for Guardrails. Guardrails shall be designed and constructed of materials that limit visual impacts. Unless the City Planner finds it is unnecessary to limit visual impacts, guardrails shall be designed or constructed of materials that are mostly open or transparent when retaining walls are located in a front yard setback, rear yard back (on through lots), street side yard back (within five feet of street side property line), or in other instances where retaining walls are in a location or have a height that will have significant visual impacts unless guardrails are mostly open. Guardrails are "mostly open" when they are constructed of materials that may include, but are not limited to glass or have metal or wood pickets. The City Planner determines if the design and materials of guardrails will adequately limit visual impacts. The City Planner's decision may be appealed per Chapter 17.12.140. 
c.  Guardrails with Pilasters. When incorporated into guardrails required by the Building Code, pilasters shall be allowed above retaining walls as follows: 
i.  The maximum height of pilasters shall not exceed 42 inches as measured from the top of the retaining wall to the top of pilasters. In the case where swimming pools are proposed, the height of the pilasters shall be no higher than the minimum height required by the Swimming Pool Code. 
ii.  The minimum centerline distance between pilasters shall not be less than six feet when the pilaster is part of the required guardrail and not less than four feet when the pilaster is part of the required hand rail for stairways. 
4.  Exceptions. 
a.  The following exceptions are allowed with the approval of a Minor Exception Permit. 
i.  An increase in the permitted height of retaining walls up to a maximum height of six feet for walls located in front yards, rear yards (on through lots), or located within five feet of street-side yard property lines. 
ii.  An increase in the permitted height of a retaining wall up to a maximum height of eight feet, six inches for walls not located in front yards, rear yards (on through lots), or street-side yards. 
b.  Required Findings. In addition to the general findings required for specific permits, all of the following findings shall be made prior to the approval of a Minor Exception Permit to exceed the standards for retaining walls: 
i.  The height of the retaining wall will not be unsightly or incompatible with the character of or uses in the neighborhood; 
ii.  The height of the retaining wall will not have negative visual impacts upon the street scene or obstruct views of traffic to and from driveway; 
iii.  The additional height is necessary, given topographical constraints.

A.  Purpose and Intent. Because the standards for lot size and width have been amended a number of times since San Clemente's incorporation as a City, there are a number of substandard residential and nonresidential lots in the City. The purpose of this section is to provide for the development of lots which are currently substandard but existed legally at the time of their creation. 
B.  Regulations. Structures may only be erected or enlarged on a substandard lot, if the substandard lot met the minimum size and width requirements for the zone in which it is located on the day the lot became a legal lot of record. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.24.210 - Through Lots, Rear Yard Setbacks for. 
A.  Residential Zones and Residential Lots In Mixed-Use Zones. In the case of through lots, the rear yard setback shall be the same numerical requirement as the front yard setback. The rear yard setback for a through lot may not be reduced by using the provisions for the median front yard setback found in Section 17.32.050(J), Residential Zone Special Development Standards, Front Setback, Special Provisions for Reduction, of this title.

F.  Deed Restriction. Prior to issuance of a building permit for an ADU, a deed restriction shall be recorded against the title of the property in the County Recorder's office and a copy filed with the City Planner. Said deed restriction shall run with the land and shall bind all future owners, heirs, successors, or assigns. The form of the deed restriction shall be provided by the City and shall provide that: 
1.  The ADU may not be sold separately from the primary dwelling. 
2.  The ADU is restricted to the approved size and to other attributes allowed by this section. 
3.  The deed restriction runs with the land and may be enforced against future property owners. 
4.  The deed restriction may be removed if the owner eliminates the ADU. To remove the deed restriction, an owner may make a written request of the City Planner, providing evidence that the ADU has in fact been removed. The City Planner may then determine whether the evidence supports the claim that the ADU has been removed. Appeal may be taken from the City Planner's determination consistent with other provisions of this Code. 
5.  The deed restrictions shall be enforced by the City Planner or designee for the benefit of the City. Failure of the property owner to comply with the deed restriction may result in legal action against the property owner, and the City is authorized to obtain any remedy available to it at law or equity, including, but not limited to, obtaining an injunction enjoining use of the ADU in violation of the recorded restrictions or abatement of the illegal unit.

The purpose of this section is to provide standards for Short-term Lodging Units ("STLU") and Short-term Apartment Rentals ("STAR"), where allowed in compliance with Title 17, Zoning, and Chapter 3.24, Transient Occupancy Tax, of the municipal code. STLUs and STARs are lodging uses (which are inherently commercial), typically located within structures designed for long-term residential tenancy. As such, special consideration must be given to STLUs and STARs to ensure that the existing character of residential neighborhoods are preserved and not adversely impacted. 
B.  Applicability . This section applies to STLUs and STARs as those terms are defined in this title. STLU uses, including STARs, are permitted only within certain visitor-serving, mixed-use, and residential neighborhoods, as provided in the use tables in Chapters 17.32, Residential Zones and Standards, and 17.40, Mixed-Use Zones and Standards, of this title, and on terms consistent with the requirements of Chapter 3.24 and Title 17 of the municipal code.

1.  Architectural Treatment. The exterior architectural appearance of any building utilized as an STLU, including any accessory structures, shall be maintained in a residential character and shall be architecturally compatible with the neighborhood in which it is located. No building shall be constructed or altered, nor shall the operation of the STLU or STAR be such that the structure may be recognized as serving a nonresidential use either by color materials, construction, lighting, signage, landscaping, or by other similar effects. 
2.  Rentals Per Unit. The maximum number of STLUs allowed within any single dwelling unit is one. 
3.  Insurance. All STLU owners shall obtain and maintain vacation rental property insurance that covers the commercial lodging use of the site. Proof of insurance shall be provided to the Community Development Director or his or her designee. Proof of insurance for use of property as an STLU must also be resubmitted each year. 
4.  Noise and Disorderly Conduct. STLU renters and their guests shall not create unreasonable noise or disturbances, engage in disorderly conduct, or violate provisions of this code or any state or federal law or regulation, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to noise disorderly conduct, the consumption of alcohol, or the use of illegal drugs. The STLU owner shall ensure compliance with this provision. 
5.  Responsive Contact. The STLU owner shall provide a 24-hour emergency contact that will respond, on-site if requested, within 30 minutes to complaints about the condition, operation or conduct of STLU renters or their guests. Prior to any change to the 24-hour emergency contact, the STLU owner shall submit a revised STLU zoning permit application to the Community Development Director, or designee for approval. 
6.  Compliance. The STLU owner shall comply with all applicable codes regarding fire building construction and safety, and all other relevant laws, regulations, and ordinances. The City's failure to inspect STLUs does not constitute a waiver of its right to perform future inspections. 
7.  Posting the Permit. The STLU owner shall post a copy of the permit and house rules that comply with the conditions set forth in this section in a conspicuous place in the STLU. 
8.  No Events. An STLU may only be used for overnight lodging. It shall not be used for a wedding, bachelor or bachelorette party, or other party conference, or any other similar event. 
9.  Notice. Each STLU owner shall, upon issuance of any STLU zoning permit or upon any approved change to an existing STLU zoning permit, provide written notice to the Community Development Director and to all neighboring property owners (within a radius of 300 feet of the STLU property) the following information: 
a.  The names of the STLU owner and of the STLU operator (if not the owner), including telephone numbers, at which those parties may be reached on a 24-hour basis. 
b.  The City's Code Enforcement telephone number by which members of the public may report violations of this chapter. 
c.  The maximum number of renters that are permitted to stay in the unit. 
10.  The Community Development Director may request access to an STLU or to records related to the use and occupancy of the unit for the purpose of inspection or audit to determine that the objectives and conditions of this chapter are being fulfilled. On such request, the STLU owner shall provide access to the Director during normal business hours. 
11.  Occupancy Limit. The maximum number of renters and guests in an STLU may not exceed two persons per legal bedroom plus two persons, but in no event may the maximum occupancy of any STLU exceed 10 or the maximum allowed under Title 15 of the code, whichever is lower; provided, however, that dwelling units with five or more legal bedrooms may apply to the Community Development Director for a waiver of the 10-person occupancy limit, which the Director may approve, conditionally approve, or deny based on reasonable and objective criteria. The Community Development Director's decision on a waiver of the 10-person occupancy limit is discretionary but shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Director shall establish reasonable and objective criteria, based upon legal bedrooms, for evaluating the 10-person waiver requests and shall submit the criteria to the City Council for adoption by resolution. The criteria may be amended by resolution. The STLU owner shall by written agreement with the renter limit overnight occupancy of the STLU to the maximum number of guests. 
12.  Upon notification that an STLU renter or a renter's guest has violated Subsection 17.28.292(C)(5), Noise and Disorderly Conduct, or 17.28.292(C)(11), Occupancy Limit and Parking, above, the STLU owner shall promptly notify the renter of the violation and take such action as is necessary to prevent a recurrence. It is not intended that the owner act as a law-enforcement officer or place himself or herself in harm's way.

CHAPTER 17.32 - RESIDENTIAL ZONES AND STANDARDS 
 
17.32.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
The General Plan details the goals, objectives and policies for the City's residential zones, including the preservation of existing residential neighborhoods throughout the City. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the General Plan's vision for the residential zones through development regulations that allow for a range of residential opportunities for all socioeconomic groups and ensure that new residential development maintains existing and achieves new high-quality, distinctive neighborhoods. 
A.  Residential, Very Low (RVL) Density Zone . The RVL land-use designation is the least intense residential designation in the City, and is intended to preserve currently undeveloped canyons which are either geologically unstable or aesthetic, open-space, or biological resources. This zone is intended as an area for the development of single-family detached homes on significant acreage at a maximum density of 1.0 dwelling units per 20 gross acres or per legal parcel of record as of May 6, 1993, whichever is smaller in size. 
B.  Residential, Low (RL) Density Zone . The RL land-use designation permits the development of low-density, single-family residential neighborhoods with single-family detached dwellings. A maximum density of 4.5 units per gross acre and 7.0 units per net acre is allowed in this zone. 
C.  Residential, Medium-Low (RML) Density Zone . The RML land-use designation permits the development of medium-low-density residential development, including single-family detached, attached homes (including clustered homes), and townhomes. A maximum density of 7.0 units per gross acre and 10.0 units per net acre is allowed in this zone. 
D.  Residential, Medium (RM) Density Zone . The RM land-use designation permits the development of housing opportunities of a more intense nature than single-family detached and attached residential, including clustered homes, townhomes and other multifamily structures. A maximum density of 15.0 units per gross acre and 24.0 units per net acre is allowed in this zone. 
E.  Residential, High (RH) Density Zone . The RH land-use designation permits the development of the most intensive residential development allowed in the City for high-density, single-family attached and multifamily residential development. A maximum density of 24.0 units per gross acre and 36.0 units per net acre is allowed in this zone. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996) 
(Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
17.32.020 - Residential Densities. 
The Zoning Ordinance limits the maximum density for each residential zone; however, the density allowed for any residential project within the City may be limited further through the appropriate discretionary review process, when discretionary review is provided for in this title. The Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, and/or City Council shall have the authority to reasonably condition any residential development subject to discretionary review to ensure proper transition to and compatibility with adjacent residential developments, existing or proposed. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.32.030 - Residential Use Regulations.

Substandard Lots 	Section 17.24.200 
Through Lots for Rear Yard Setback 	Section 17.24.210 
 
A.  Arbors. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. Structures in the front setback of residential zones are limited to a height of 42 inches to provide for an open street scene, to allow the primary structures on a street to be visible and to contribute to the visual character of the neighborhood, and to allow for unobstructed views of traffic to and from driveways. Arbors, typically taller than 42 inches and located in front yard setback, can be a desirable addition to the architecture of a residence and to the street scene. The purpose and intent of this section is to provide for arbors to exceed the height limit of structures in the front yard setback area, while addressing the potential negative impacts of these structures. 
2.  Standards and Review Requirements. Arbors are permitted to encroach into the front yard setback in residential zones with the approval of a Minor Exception Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.090, Minor Exception Permits, of this title, and in accordance with the maximum standards listed below in Table 17.32.050B, Arbor Standards, of this section. 
Table 17.32.050B 
Arbor Standards 
Standard 	Maximum Allowed 
Width 	6.5 feet 
Height 	7.5 feet for arbor; for standards for a gate within an arbor, please refer to standards for fence, walls, and hedges, Section 17.24.090, of this title 
Depth 	3 feet 
 
3.  Required Findings. Prior to the approval of a Minor Exception Permit for arbors, all the following findings shall be made, along with the general findings for a Minor Exception Permit: 
a.  The arbor does not create sight distance problems to and from the appropriate street(s); 
b.  The arbor supports plant material; 
c.  The style, materials, color, and finish of the arbor must be consistent with the style of the main building on the site; and 
d.  The arbor is located entirely on private property; 
e.  The arbor must be appropriate in scale with the main building on the site. 
B.  Density Allowance for Lots with Less than 3,600 Square Feet of Lot Area. In the RM zone, when a lot has less than 3,600 square feet of lot area, a duplex will be permitted. 
C.  Distance Between Primary Buildings, Minimum Required. Primary buildings shall be constructed so that a minimum of 10 feet between primary buildings is provided. 
D.  Front Setback, Special Provisions for Reduction. 
1.  Choice of Front Yard Setback. In residential zones where at least four lots in a block have been improved with primary buildings, the minimum required front yard setback shall be either: 
a.  The median front yard setbackthe median of the measurements taken from the front property line to the nearest point of the primary building (the "point of setback") on all improved lots within the block; or 
Figure 17.32.050A 
 
b.  The minimum front yard setback required for the given zone. Subdivision 1 of this subsection, Choice of Front Yard Setback, shall not apply in any subdivision where staggered setbacks have been approved and established. 
2.  Measurements That Cannot Be Included in Calculating the Median Front Yard Setback. For the purpose of this section, the following measurements shall not be included in the calculation of the median front yard setback: 
a.  Measurements to detached accessory buildings; 
b.  Measurements to attached in-the-bank garages benefiting from the provisions of Section 17.32.050(K), Garage Encroachment into the Front Yard Setbacks, of this title; 
c.  Measurements on a through lot, unless the primary building on the through lot has its main entry on the street on which the front yard setback median is being measured; 
d.  Measurements to any structures on flag lots; 
e.  Measurements to any garages on RVL, RM and RH lots. 
3.  Additional Limits Upon the Median Front Yard Setback. 
a.  String Line Limits. When both adjacent lots have been used in the calculation of the median front yard setback for a block, then no structure on a lot shall encroach beyond a string line drawn between the points of setback on the adjacent lots. 
Figure 17.32.050B 
 
b.  When the String Line Intersects and/or is Less Restrictive than the Median. Any portion of the string line that is less restrictive than the median shall not be used to allow a structure to encroach more than the median front yard setback established for the block. 
Figure 17.32.050C 
 
E.  Garage Encroachment Into the Front Yard Setback. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. Some residential lots within the City have a steep topography. On these lots, the requirement of the standard front yard setback for a garage could result in significant grading and/or fill. The purpose of allowing garages to encroach into the front yard setback on these lots is to reduce the need for mass grading or fill and allow structures to follow the natural topography of the site, either stepping up or down with the lot. 
2.  Review Requirements. Encroachment of new garages into the front setback, as provided for in this section, shall require the approval of a Minor Exception Permit, in accordance with Chapter 17.16, Applications, of this title. 
3.  Encroachment. If the existing natural grade on the lot has a rise or fall in excess of 10 feet, as measured from the elevation at the established top of curb, attached garages may use the following setback. 
a.  A 15-foot front yard setback for the garage, when the 10-foot grade difference occurs within 35 feet of the front property line. 
Figure 17.32.050D 
 
b.  A 10-foot front yard setback for the garage, when the 10-foot grade difference occurs within 30 feet of the front property line. 
Figure 17.32.050E 
 
c.  A five-foot front yard setback for the garage, when the 10-foot grade difference occurs within 25 feet of the front property line.

d.  The limitations imposed by Subsection (E)(3)(a) through (c) of this section may be modified through a Minor Exception Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.090, Minor Exception Permits, of this title, when in the opinion of the decision-making authority for this permit, conditions justify such modifications. 
4.  Other Requirements. Garages that benefit from this exception must comply with the following requirements: 
a.  Maximum Height Limits. 
i.  Flat-Roofed Garages. Flat-roofed garages shall not exceed 10 feet from the floor to top of roof, excluding open railings when required by the Uniform Building Code. The height of the railings shall not exceed the minimum necessary to comply with the Uniform Building Code. 
ii.  Other Roofs. Roofs with architectural interest, as determined through the Minor Exception Permit process, may be allowed to exceed 10 feet up to a height of 15 feet. 
b.  A certified topography map must be submitted when required by the grade. The topography map shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor or registered civil engineer. 
c.  Roll-up doors shall be required for garages encroaching within the front yard setback. 
5.  Required Findings. Prior to approval of the Minor Exception Permit for garage encroachment, the decision-making authority shall make all of the following findings, along with the general findings for a Minor Exception Permit: 
a.  The encroachment complies with the standards of this section; 
b.  The slope of the front of the lot is significant enough in both length and width that requirement of the standard front yard setback will result in significant grading and/or fill; and 
c.  The proposed project reduces the need for mass grading and/or fill and allows the structures on the site to follow the natural topography of the site. 
F.  Special Provisions for Dwelling Units with Front Entrances Located Along the Side Property Line. 
1.  Applicability. This section shall apply to residential properties meeting both of the following criteria: 
a.  The front entrance to the dwelling unit is located on the side of the dwelling unit that faces the side property line; and 
b.  The dwelling unit is located in the RML, RM or RH zone. 
2.  Standards. 
a.  The interior-side yard setback, as measured from the property line to the rear side of the front entrance of a dwelling unit, shall be a minimum of eight feet. 
b.  The minimum eight-foot interior-side yard setback is required for the story containing the front entrance. Stories above the story containing the front entrance are not subject to the side entrance requirement and shall 17.32.040, Residential Zone Development Standards. Stories below the story containing the front entrance must maintain the eight-foot interior-side yard setback for the portion of the story that includes the primary access to the front entrance.

G.  Height Limitations for Structures used primarily for religious worship. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. It is generally recognized that structures used primarily for religious worship are icons within the community that are characterized by tall structures with steeply pitched roofs. Structures used primarily for religious worship, which are typically taller than the height limits of the residential zone, can be a desirable addition to the architecture of a residential neighborhood and to the street scene. The purpose and intent of this section is to allow for structures used primarily for religious worship to exceed the maximum building height limits of the residential zone, while ensuring reasonable compatibility with adjacent and nearby land uses and addressing the potential negative impacts of these structures. 
B.  Applicability. This section shall apply to all structures used primarily for religious worship in Residential Zones. 
C.  Standards and Review Requirements. Structures used primarily for religious worship are permitted to exceed the height limits of the residential zone to a maximum height of 45 feet with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.060, Conditional Use Permits, of this title, and in accordance with the Required Findings listed below in Section (4). 
Church steeples in residential zones may exceed the 45 feet Church height limitation in accordance with Table 17.24.080(B), Maximum Encroachments into Setbacks and Height Limits. 
D.  Required Findings. Prior to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit to allow structures used primarily for religious worship to exceed the height limits of the residential zone up to a maximum of 45 feet, all of the following findings shall be made, along with the general findings for a Conditional Use Permit: 
a.  The structure(s) used primarily for religious worship is compatible with the surrounding land uses and will not create adverse impacts to surrounding uses; and 
b.  The height of the structures used primarily for religious worship shall have minimal impacts on public views as demonstrated in visual simulations prepared by the applicant; and 
c.  The increased building height adds to the architectural interest of the project; and 
d.  The increased building height emphasizes primary buildings and/or distinct places within the institution's site; and 
e.  The features of all structures on-site are reasonably compatible and consistent with the project site and the surrounding neighborhood.

Editor's note Ord. No. 1609/1610, § 4(Exh. B, 1), adopted November 17, 2015, amended Ch. 17.36, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Ch. 17.36 pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for historical derivations. 
 
17.36.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
The General Plan details the goals, objectives and policies for the City's commercial zones, including provisions for a range of retail and office uses necessary to support the daily needs of residents of and visitors to San Clemente. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the General Plan's vision for the commercial zones through development regulations that allow for a variety of retail and office uses, while creating distinct commercial areas that are compatible with their surrounding environment. 
A.  Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Zones . Neighborhood Commercial Zones are intended to be less intense than community or regionally oriented commercial zones in San Clemente. There are five neighborhood commercial zones: NC 1.1, NC 1.2, NC 1.3, NC 2, and NC 3. The General Plan restricts the intensity of the Neighborhood Commercial Zones primarily through the floor area ratio limit for the zones. The maximum floor area ratio limits for these districts range from 0.35 to 0.75. The uses prescribed by the General Plan for the Neighborhood Commercial Zones are essentially the same as those prescribed by the General Plan for the Community Commercial Zones, which are described below. 
B.  Coastal and Recreation Serving Commercial (CRC) Zone . The Coastal and Recreation Serving Commercial Zone provides particular standards to support retail commercial activities, recreation, dining and lodging oriented to San Clemente's beaches and visitor areas. It is applied in the Specific Plans within the Coastal Zone (CZ). 
C.  Community Commercial (CC) Zones . Community Commercial Zones are more intense than Neighborhood Commercial Zones. The General Plan allows for this additional intensity by allowing higher floor area ratio limits in the Community Commercial Zones. There are four Community Commercial Zones: CC 1, CC 2, CC 3, and CC 4. The maximum floor area ratio limits for these districts range from 0.5 to 0.7. The General Plan allows the same uses in the Community Commercial Zones as it allows in the Neighborhood Commercial Zones, with the exception of additional medical related uses. 
D.  Regional Commercial (RC1) Zone. The Regional Commercial Zone is applied to an area in which the scale of the site, its access and location provide an appropriate setting for regional serving retail commercial, entertainment, dining, and financial and professional offices. This site is located within the Marblehead Coastal Specific Plan area. 
E.  Regional Medical Facilities (RMF) Zones . The Regional Medical Facilities Zone is designed to allow regional general hospital uses. The site in San Clemente receiving this designation is large and can accommodate an intensity of development required for a regional oriented-serving hospital use. There is one Regional Medical Facilities Zone regulated by the Zoning Ordinance: RMF1. The General Plan primarily distinguishes this site by the uses allowed. The RMF1 zone provides for the continued use and development of the existing general hospital facilities at 654 Camino De Los Mares. 
(Ord. No. 1609/1610, § 4(Exh. B, 1), 11-17-2015; Ord. No. 1616, § 4, 2-2-2016; Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
17.36.020 - Commercial Use Regulations. 
A.  Permitted and Conditionally Permitted Uses . Tables 17.36.020, Commercial Zone Uses, list uses which shall be the primary uses allowed to occur on a property. All uses except for those provided for in Sections 17.28.210, Outdoor Display Areas, and 17.28.300, Temporary Uses and Structures, of this title shall be conducted within enclosed structures. The primary uses identified in Table 17.36.020, Commercial Zone Uses, shall be permitted or conditionally permitted as indicated: 
P 	Where the symbol "P" appears, the use shall be permitted. 
MC 	Where the symbol "MC" appears, the use shall be permitted subject to the issuance of a Minor Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.070, Minor Conditional Use Permits, of this title. 
C 	Where the symbol "C" appears, the use shall be permitted subject to the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.060, Conditional Use Permits, of this title. 
O 	Where the symbol "O" appears, the use is subject to an alternative review process described in a subsequent footnote. 
 
B.  Prohibited Uses. The following uses are prohibited: 
1.  Uses that are listed in Table 17.36.020 but that are not identified as either permitted  "P"  or conditionally-permitted  "MC" or "C"; and 
2.  Uses that are excluded from Table 17.36.020, unless they are found by the City to be similar to permitted or conditionally-permitted uses. 
3.  Uses where a blank cell appears in Table 17.36.020. 
4.  As indicated in Table 17.36.020, the following uses are not permitted in any commercial zone: 
a.  Marijuana Cultivation. 
b.  Marijuana Manufacturing. 
c.  Marijuana Testing Laboratory. 
d.  Marijuana Delivery. 
e.  Marijuana Dispensary. 
5.  The cultivation of industrial hemp, as defined in Section 11018.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, is not permitted in any commercial zone to the fullest extent allowed by state law.

CHAPTER 17.40 - MIXED-USE ZONES AND STANDARDS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1609/1610, § 5(Exh. c, 1), adopted November 17, 2015, amended Ch. 17.40, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Ch. 17.40 pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for historical derivations. 
 
17.40.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
The General Plan details the goals, objectives, and policies for the City's mixed-use zones, including the establishment of active, pedestrian-oriented districts which enhance the quality of life and vitality of the City. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the General Plan's vision for distinct mixed-use zones through development regulations that allow for the mixture of retail, office and residential uses within the same zone, while achieving a high level of architectural quality. 
A combination of mixed-use zones and overlays are established to bring particular development standards for designated parcels within the downtown core, in the transitional areas near the core, in frontage areas on El Camino Real, within the North Beach, in the Pier Bowl and along the southern portion of El Camino Real east of Interstate 5, described in the following paragraphs. 
A.  North Beach Mixed-Use (MU 1) Zone . A vertical or horizontal mix of Neighborhood Serving Commercial (NC) and Community Serving Commercial (CC), and multifamily housing on the second floor or higher. The North Beach area includes this zone to provide for a mix of uses and development standards similar to those within the Downtown transition area, while excluding stand-alone residential development. 
B.  North El Camino Real Mixed-Use (MU 2) Zone . A vertical or horizontal mix of Neighborhood Serving Commercial (NC), Community Serving Commercial (CC), and multifamily housing. The North El Camino Real is a unique community and visitor serving hub for entertainment and coastal recreation. This zone is intended to support the fulfillment of this character and potential through adopted development standards. In large measure, the zone replicates the use provisions of the former C2 zone, which had allowed for a mix of uses. 
C.  Downtown Mixed-Use (MU 3.0) Zone . The downtown area (MU 3.0) is defined in the San Clemente General Plan as the symbolic "core" of the City, maintaining its pedestrian-oriented village character. The MU 3.0 zone allows a vertical or horizontal mix of Neighborhood Serving Commercial (NC) and Community Serving Commercial (CC)  Attached and multifamily housing is permitted on the second floor or higher. Commercial development(nonresidential uses) are allowed in this zone such as community and tourist-serving retail commercial, entertainment, restaurants, offices, institutional and public uses. Residential uses accompanying commercial development are accommodated within this zone. Along with enhancing the pedestrian nature of downtown, the inclusion of residential uses into commercial development will provide housing opportunities for employees and owners of commercial establishments, as well as others interested in living in the downtown area. 
Many of the sites in the downtown area also have an Architectural (-A) Overlay District designation and/or a Central Business (-CB) District overlay designation. The requirements of these overlay districts affect the use, style and physical layout of projects. The overlay districts are described in Chapter 17.56, Overlay Districts and Standards, of this title. (Please refer to the City's Zoning Maps for the location of these overlay districts.) 
The location of uses and parking within projects is particularly important to the pedestrian ambiance of this zone. In the CB Overlay District, pedestrian-oriented uses are to be located along the street and less pedestrian-oriented uses to the rear or above street facing spaces. 
Throughout the MU 3.0 zone, residential units are encouraged above the street level of projects to provide housing opportunities for employees, owners of commercial establishments and others interested in living in the downtown area, as well as to make room for more pedestrian-oriented uses on the street level. The City may allow nonresidential uses included in Table 17.40.030, Permitted and Conditionally Permitted Uses within the Mixed-use Zone, on the same floor as residential uses (above street level) through the appropriate discretionary review process. Buildings are to be located along the street and parking is to be located behind buildings (or to the side of buildings when parking behind buildings is impossible) to maintain and promote an interesting sidewalk scene for the pedestrian, in accordance with the City's General Plan and Urban Design Guidelines. For specific requirements regarding the location of uses, please refer to Section 17.04.030.2, Special Use Regulations for the Downtown Mixed-Use (MU 3.0) Zone, and Section 17.56.030, Central Business (-CB) Overlay District, of this title, along with the City's General Plan and Urban Design Guidelines. The use of nonresidential space in this zone is vital to the pedestrian nature of the area. Nonresidential spaces must contain uses that serve clients and patrons that will visit the site. These spaces may not be merely used for storage for other businesses or for adjacent residential uses or be used as spaces that function in the same manner as home occupancy uses. 
The scale, architectural style and physical layout of projects in the MU 3.0 zone are important to its pedestrian-oriented village character. In accordance with the General Plan, future development in this area is to be consistent in scale and character with the prevailing Spanish Colonial Revival buildings. For specific details, please refer to Section 17.56.020, Architectural (-A) Overlay District, of this title, along with the City's General Plan and the Urban Design Guidelines. 
D.  Downtown Transition Mixed-Use (MU 3.1) Zone . A vertical or horizontal mix of Neighborhood Serving Commercial (NC), Community Serving Commercial (CC), and multifamily housing. Also, standalone residential uses are allowed. This zoning category provides providing for a transitional level of development surrounding the Downtown Core. Important distinctions regarding height and design form, plus an allowance for stand-alone residential development, distinguish this zone from the MU 3.0 zone. 
E.  El Camino Real South, West of Interstate 5 Mixed-Use (MU 3.2) Zone . A vertical or horizontal mix of Neighborhood Serving Commercial (NC), Community Serving Commercial (CC), and multifamily housing. This zone is particularly applied to parcels fronting the west side of El Camino Real and backing onto the parallel alley west of El Camino Real, southward of Downtown and northward of the Interstate 5 overcrossing. These particular parcels average approximately 100 feet in depth and slope downward from El Camino Real. The alley at the rear of these parcels abuts the single family residential (RL) zone. The intent of the MU 3.2 zone is to provide for commercial development fronting El Camino Real and mixed use development opportunity while respecting the scale of development on the neighboring residential areas. 
F.  Downtown/Residential Allowance Area Mixed-Use (MU 3.3) Zone . A vertical or horizontal mix of Neighborhood Serving Commercial (NC) and multifamily housing. A series of parcels on Avenida Del Mar, Calle Seville, and Avenida Granada, southwest of South Ola Vista, which have been developed as residences can contribute to the scale and design of the downtown area while allowing for residential uses into the future. 
G.  El Camino Real South, East of Interstate 5 Mixed-Use (MU 5) Zone . Neighborhood Serving Commercial (NC) commercial uses or multifamily housing. The MU 5 land-use designation accommodates commercial and residential development within the same zone, but limits development such that commercial and residential uses cannot exist on the same lot. The standards for this zone include a requirement that the type of use allowed, residential or commercial, depends upon whether large contiguous areas of that use exist. 
(Ord. No. 1609/1610, § 5(Exh. C, 1), 11-17-2015; Ord. No. 1638 , § 3(Exh. A, § 3), 1-17-2017; Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
17.40.020 - Residential Densities in Mixed-Use Zones. 
This title limits the maximum and minimum residential density for each mixed-use zone; however, the density allowed for any residential project within the City may be limited further through the appropriate discretionary review process, when discretionary review is provided for in this title. The Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission and/or City Council shall have the authority to reasonably condition any residential development subject to discretionary review to ensure proper transition to and compatibility with adjacent developments, existing or proposed. 
(Ord. No. 1609/1610, § 5(Exh. C, 1), 11-17-2015)

Notes to MU 3.1, Development Standards, "Parking": 
1  This exception is made for the Downtown Parking Study Area because of the results of Downtown, North Beach, and Pier Bowl Parking Needs Assessment completed in 1995. The study found that there was an excess supply of parking space within the Study Area for the uses existing at the time of the study, even considering that a number of lots within the Study Area are nonconforming as to parking. When requests for alterations of use and additional square footage are considered by the City, only the net increase in parking requirements will be assessed, as opposed to requiring that projects make up for existing parking deficiencies within a site. 
2  Example: If an existing retail establishment currently requiring four parking spaces wishes to convert to a restaurant requiring seven parking spaces, the net increase in parking requirements is three spaces. To be permitted by the City, the restaurant in this example would have to be able to cover the net increase of three parking spaces. The following table illustrates the additional parking spaces that the restaurant would need to provide to be approved:

Height Limitations 	The maximum height of a project is limited by a height ceiling, height average limit, and alley transitional height limit. The height ceiling is applied to limit building mass to two stories facing El Camino Real while allowing for additional building mass behind and below, tucked into downward slopes that extend to an alley along the rear property line. The most restrictive of the following height limitations shall be applied to projects: 
  
1. Height Ceiling. A height ceiling shall extend above properties from the front property line to rear property line so that no roof or building element may have a height that exceeds the height ceiling. The height ceiling shall be as follows: a maximum plate line height of 28 feet and maximum top of roof height of 33 feet. The height ceiling is measured above the front property line midpoint elevation. With the approval of a Conditional Use Permit, the height ceiling may be raised to a maximum plate line height of 30 feet and maximum top of roof height of 35 feet. For approval, the review authority (City Council) shall meet the general findings for a Conditional Use Permit [Section 17.16.060.F] and specific findings below. 
  
 a. The proposed height increase will: 
  
 ;en en; minimize obstructions of ocean views from the freeway; or
 
  ii. maintain a greater portion of freeway ocean views through roof and building offsets than what could be achieved if the project has the maximum top of roof height ceiling of 33 feet.
 
2. Height Average Limit. Projects may have a maximum plate line height of 37 feet and top of roof height of 45 feet, provided that building height complies with the height ceiling limitation.
 
3. Alley Transitional Setback Height Limit and Offset. A height limitation shall be applied to transition building mass of the MU 3.2 zone down to the allowed height and scale of residential properties across the rear facing alley. The height limit is applied as follows:
 
 
MU 3.2 Development Standards 
Standard 	MU 3.2 Zone Requirement 
	 a. Any part of a building that exceeds a maximum top of roof height of 28 feet shall be set back a minimum of 13 feet from the rear property line. 
  
 b. Height is measured above the rear lot line midpoint elevation. 
Story Limitation, El Camino Real Frontage 	Two-story limit on projects facing South El Camino Real. Projects shall be limited to two stories above street level within 25 feet inward of the front property line. 
Provision of Enclosed Residential Storage 	Each dwelling unit shall be provided with an enclosed storage space for the personal and private use of each residence in accordance with the following table: 
  
  Bedrooms     Enclosed Storage (cubic feet cf.) 
 Studio/One   150 cf. 
 Two       200 cf. 
 Three      250 cf. 
 Four or More  300 cf. 
  
Design Requirements: 
1. Enclosed storage spaces may contain no dimension smaller than two feet and may not be divided into more than two locations. 
2. At least 70 percent of the required space must be contiguous with the unit or required parking area it serves. 
3. Storage spaces shall be as secure as possible. All storage spaces which are accessible from outside the living area must utilize one-inch deadbolt single cylinder locks, security-type hinges with non-removable pins, and solid core doors. Such spaces must be constructed in a secure workmanlike manner and of materials so as to resist forced entries. 
4. One-half of the required space may be provided within the attic if it is accessible by a pull-down or stationary stairway. Where attic storage is provided, it shall be enclosed with one-hour fire-resistive construction. 
5. Storage may not be provided by the enclosure of all or part of a required parking space to the extent that it prevents the full use of the space. If storage is provided by a suspended shelf or cabinetry, such shelf or cabinet may not extend to a point lower than 4'-0" above the surface of the parking space. 
Parking Credit for Increase in Minimum Commercial Floor Area Ratio 	For projects that have commercial floor space in excess of .35 floor area ratio, one parking space may be waived for every 300 square feet of additional floor area provided in excess of .35. There shall be a limit of three parking waivers allowed per project. 
Open Residential Parking Spaces 	Each residential unit's required parking spaces shall be open within the project's garage

(Ord. No. 1609/1610, § 5(Exh. C, 1), 11-17-2015; Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
CHAPTER 17.44 - OPEN-SPACE ZONES AND STANDARDS 
 
17.44.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
The General Plan details the goals, objectives and policies for the City's open-space zones, including the preservation and enhancement of an extensive network of parks, passive open spaces, and recreational facilities for the use of San Clemente residents and visitors. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the General Plan's vision for the open-space zones through development regulations that allow for a range of passive and active open-space opportunities, the preservation of environmental and aesthetic resources including topographical features, and protection of life and property from environmental hazards. 
A.  Publicly Owned Open-Space (OS 1) Zone. The OS 1 land-use designation is intended to preserve publicly owned open space including parks, recreational uses, and ancillary facilities, permitting a range of activities from passive recreational uses such as hiking to more intensive, active recreational uses requiring indoor or outdoor recreational facilities. 
B.  Publicly Owned Shoreline (OS S1) Zone. The OS S1 land-use designation is intended to preserve publicly owned shoreline as open space, while allowing for passive and active recreational activities, and preserving the unique character of San Clemente's oceanfront, coastal resources, public views, and access to coastal resources. Activities in the OS S1 zone shall range from passive recreational uses such as walking to more intensive, active recreational, cultural, and tourist-oriented uses requiring indoor or outdoor facilities, such as the public pier. 
C.  Privately Owned Open-Space (OS 2 and OS 3) Zones. The General Plan contains two categories of strictly privately owned open space, OS 2 and OS 3, both of which are intended to accommodate privately owned open space for passive recreational activities, aesthetic enjoyment, the protection of significant environmental resources, including sensitive habitat and topographical features, and protection of life and property from environmental hazards. Along with a number of passive recreational activities, the OS 2 designation also allows for golf courses and ancillary uses. The OS 3 designation comprises parcels that are set aside by easements and intended for the preservation of open space. 
D.  Privately Owned Shoreline (OS S2) Zone. The OS S2 land-use designation is intended to preserve privately owned shoreline as open space, while allowing for passive recreational activities, encouraging increasing public access, and preserving the unique character of San Clemente's oceanfront, coastal resources. Activities in the OS S2 zone shall include passive recreational activities such as surfing, hiking and swimming. 
E.  Publicly and Privately Owned Golf Courses (OSC) Zone. The OSC land-use designation is intended to preserve open space in the form of publicly or privately owned golf courses and ancillary facilities, including clubhouses, restaurants, driving ranges, and pro shops. Golf courses and their ancillary facilities shall be designed to be compatible with adjacent development and to preserve significant environmental resources, including habitat areas and topographical features, to the extent feasible.

CHAPTER 17.48 - PUBLIC ZONES AND STANDARDS 
 
17.48.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
The General Plan details the goals, objectives and policies for the City's public zones. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the General Plan's vision for the public zones through development regulations that allow for a range of public buildings and services designed to be compatible in scale, mass, character and architecture with the zone or neighborhood in which they are located. 
A.  Civic Center (CVC) Zone . The CVC land-use designation is intended to provide for limited governmental offices and related facilities on the City's existing civic center site. This designation is intended to be the less intense of the public zones, allowing fewer uses than those allowed in the Public Zone. 
B.  Public (P) Zone . The P land-use designation is intended to provide for a broad range of public facilities on public lands. This zone is the more intense of the public zones established in the City's General Plan, allowing a greater range of public uses, including governmental administrative, public recreational, cultural (such as public libraries and museums), educational (public schools), and institutional facilities, public and private parking, and undeveloped parks. 
C.  Institutional (INST) Zone . The Institutional Zone is intended to provide for a broad range of institutional uses, including cultural, religious and educational facilities. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996; Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
17.48.020 - Public Zone Use Regulations. 
A.  Permitted and Conditionally Permitted Uses. The uses identified in Table 17.48.020, Public Zone Uses, shall be the primary uses allowed to occur on a property.

The primary uses identified in Table 17.48.020, Permitted and Conditional Uses Within Public Zones, shall be permitted or conditionally permitted as indicated: 
P 	Where the symbol "P" appears, the use shall be permitted. 
MC 	Where the symbol "MC" appears, the use shall be permitted subject to the issuance of a Minor Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.070, Minor Conditional Use Permits, of this title. 
C 	Where the symbol "C" appears, the use shall be permitted subject to the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.060, Conditional Use Permits, of this title. 
O 	Where the symbol "O" appears, the use is subject to an alternative review process described in a subsequent footnote. 
 
B.  Prohibited Uses. The following uses are prohibited: 
1.  Uses that are listed in Table 17.48.020, Public Zone Uses, but are not identified as either permitted"P"or conditionally permitted"MC or C"; and 
2.  Uses that have been excluded from Table 17.48.020, Public Zone Uses, unless they are found by the City to be similar to permitted or conditionally permitted uses.

CHAPTER 17.52 - SPECIFIC PLAN AND STUDY AREA ZONES AND STANDARDS 
 
17.52.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
A specific plan is intended to provide a base designation for properties to further implement the goals, objectives and policies of the General Plan with respect to specific areas and uses which by their unique character require a more comprehensive and intense evaluation and planning effort. Specific plans provide development flexibility for innovation in land use mixes, site design, development concepts and building types. 
(Ord. 1185 § 3 (part), 1997; Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996) 
(Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
17.52.020 - Applicability. 
The provisions in this section shall apply to all areas designated in the City of San Clemente General Plan Land Use Element as requiring a specific plan, including the following: 
A.  Properties for which a specific plan has not been prepared, but for which a specific plan is required prior to development in accordance with the City's General Plan; and 
B.  Properties for which a specific plan has been prepared and adopted by the City Council, and which are currently designated with the name of their specific plan. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.52.030 - Adoption and Amendment of Specific Plans. 
Adoption and/or amendment of a specific plan shall occur in accordance with the provision for specific plans and specific plan amendments described in Section 17.16.030, Specific Plan Adoption and Amendments, of this title. 
The adopted specific plan shall operate as the zoning regulations for the subject property. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.52.040 - General Requirements for Specific Plan Zones. 
A.  Determination of Land Uses and Development Regulations. Precise locations of land uses and development regulations within the SP Zone shall not be fixed or predetermined until a specific plan has been adopted by the City in accordance with Section 17.16.030, Specific Plan Adoption and Amendments, of this title. 
B.  Limitations on Grading Permits, Building Permits, and Land Use Permits. No Grading Permits, Building Permits, or Land Use Permits, or other development entitlements, shall be issued for any property with an SP designation prior to the adoption of a specific plan for the property, unless such permits or entitlements are solely for emergency measures, restoration or remedial maintenance and do not in any way predispose the future use of the land. 
C.  Scope of Specific Plan. 
1.  Each specific plan shall include the specific land uses, standards and criteria necessary for the development, maintenance and use of the subject property, in compliance with the policies and programs of the General Plan. Each specific plan shall clearly specify how and to what extent the plan is to improve upon, supplement or supersede the City's Zoning Ordinance. 
2.  New specific plans and amendments to existing specific plans may be required, at the City's discretion, to include standards and a financing program for the installation of public facilities and utilities, schools, flood control and transportation facilities, and other public and private improvements and facilities related to the specific plan. 
3.  Specific plans shall address the applicable portions of State law related to the preparation of a specific plan. 
D.  Amendment of the Zoning Ordinance and Map. Adoption of a specific plan shall include an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Maps in accordance with Section 17.16.040, Zoning Amendments, of this title. Each specific plan shall be named. The Zoning Map shall not indicate the land use designations within the specific plan, but shall show the letters "SP" and an abbreviation of the specific plan name. Thereafter, all land use, development and improvements shall conform to the provisions of the adopted specific plan. 
E.  Inclusion of Specific Plan Text and Maps. Adoption of a specific plan shall include the incorporation of the specific plan text and maps as an appendix to the Zoning Ordinance. 
F.  Reference of Specific Plan Text and Maps. Adoption of a specific plan shall require the amendment of Table 17.52.060, Adopted Specific Plans, of this chapter to include a reference to the new specific plan. 
G.  Development Agreements. Specific plans shall not be required to but may be accompanied by development agreements. Approved development agreements related to specific plans are listed in Table 17.52.060, Adopted Specific Plans, of this chapter. 
H.  Requirements Not Specified . The standards in the Zoning Ordinance shall apply when development standards are not specified within individual specific plans. Any use that is not expressly permitted or prohibited in a specific plan is subject to the City's general zoning ordinance. This includes, among other things, the citywide prohibition on all cultivation of industrial hemp, as defined in Section 11018.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, and all marijuana dispensary, marijuana manufacturer, marijuana delivery, and marijuana testing laboratory uses.

CHAPTER 17.56 - OVERLAY DISTRICTS AND STANDARDS 
 
17.56.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
The General Plan establishes a number of overlay designations for the City. These designations are to be used along with underlying land-use designations, such as residential, commercial, mixed-use, and open-space designations, also established in the General Plan. Overlay districts signify that an area or site has been identified to have distinct characteristics, requiring special development standards or guidelines beyond those for the underlying zoning designation. The General Plan details the goals, objectives and policies for areas with the overlay designations, which are meant to be used along with the goals, objectives and policies for the underlying zoning designation for an area. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement the General Plan's vision for the overlay districts through development regulations and guidelines specific to each overlay. The goals for each of the overlay districts is provided with a description of the district, in the following section. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.56.020 - Architectural (-A) Overlay District. 
A.  Purpose and Intent . The purpose and intent of the Architectural ["-A"] Overlay designation is to signify a visually distinct district in San Clemente, containing structures characterized by two significant design orientations: 1) the City's traditional architectural style, Spanish Colonial Revival, and 2) a pedestrian orientation. The goals for areas with this designation are as follows to: 
1.  Maintain and enhance the unique "Spanish-Village-by-the-Sea" character of specific areas of the City; 
2.  Maintain a high quality of design consistent with the City's history, according to the General Plan Urban Design Element and City's Design Guidelines; 
3.  Require new buildings and major remodels be designed to reflect the City's Spanish Colonial Revival, except for: 
a.  Projects on properties along North El Camino Real between West Avenida Palizada and Calle Los Bolas, and on South El Camino Real between Avenida Rosa and Interstate-5 that may have Spanish Colonial Revival architecture or a true form of another Spanish architectural style, such as Mission, Monterey, or Mediterranean. 
b.  Remodels of architecture of historically significant buildings with distinctive architecture other than Spanish Colonial Revival. These remodel projects are required to preserve and reinforce the character defining features and other aspects of the site and building's design that are architecturally significant and distinct. 
4.  When Spanish Colonial Revival architecture is required, the goal of the [A] Overlay is to require site and structural development that exemplifies the Ole Hanson era, and, at the same time, allow creative interpretation of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. If this section requires architecture other than Spanish Colonial Revival, the goal of the [A] Overlay is to require site and structural development ;that is consistent with the City's Design Guidelines and in character with the architectural style required by the [A] Overlay. 
5.  Provide for the development of commercial and mixed-use (integrating commercial with residential) districts characterized by a high level of pedestrian activity; 
6.  Require that structures be sited and designed to enhance pedestrian activity along sidewalks. 
B.  Applicability . The provisions in this section apply to development within the - A Overlay. 
C.  Permitted and Conditionally Permitted Uses . Permitted and conditional uses within the -AA Overlay are the same uses as those allowed within the underlying base zones. Please refer to the use tables in Chapters 17.32, Residential Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards, of this title. 
D.  Development Review. Development in areas with this overlay designation will be subject to architectural review for compliance with the City's Design Guidelines. See Section 17.16.100, Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permits and Minor Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permits for requirements regarding architectural review. 
E.  Architectural Review Criteria . The purpose of architectural review shall vary, according to the following criteria: 
1.  Required Architecture. 
a.  Spanish Colonial Revival. Ole Hanson-era Spanish Colonial Revival architecture is required except when subsections b and c apply, below. When Spanish Colonial Revival architecture is required, site and structural developments are to exemplify the Ole Hanson era, and, at the same time, allow creative interpretation of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture; 
b.  Spanish Colonial Revival or Other Spanish Architecture. Spanish Colonial Revival architecture or other Spanish architectural styles shall be utilized, such as Monterey, Mediterranean, or Mission, etc., on properties along North El Camino Real between West Avenida Palizada and Calle Los Bolas, and on South El Camino Real between Avenida Rosa and Interstate-5. For properties in the West Pico Corridor Specific Plan, that take access from Los Obreros Lane, Spanish Architecture is required for any whole-site development proposal, and for major remodels of buildings and improvements fronting North El Camino Real. Otherwise, projects may use existing architecture. 
c.  Distinctive Architecture of Historically Significant Buildings. Projects shall preserve and reinforce the original architectural design of structures that are designated historic resources, eligible for historic listing, or potential eligible for historic listing. This includes significant structures with distinctive architectural styles that include but is not limited to Spanish Colonial Revival, Art Deco, Post-Modern, and Mid-Century Modern. Project should reinforce the building's original architectural design. 
d.  Pedestrian-Oriented Design in the [A] and [P] Overlays. Projects located in [A] and [P] Overlays shall have a pedestrian-orientation with design elements such as courtyards, paseos, outdoor eating areas, landscaping, interesting architectural details, etc. 
2.  New Structures. The architectural character for all new buildings shall reflect a pedestrian orientation, and have Spanish Colonial Revival architecture unless other architecture is required by subsection E above. New and historic structures are required to comply with all relevant sections of the City's Design Guidelines, as well as the development standards for the underlying zoning designation. 
3.  Historic Structures. Projects shall preserve and reinforce the original architectural design of significant structures that are designated historic, eligible for historic listing, or potential eligible for historic listing. This includes significant structures with distinctive architectural styles other than Spanish Colonial Revival, such as, Art Deco, Post-Modern, and Mid-Century Modern. Project should reinforce the building's original architectural design. 
4.  Remodeled Structures. Although the ultimate goals for remodeled buildings in the Architectural Overlay are to have the required architectural style per subsection E above. It may not always be practical, with minor changes, to convert a contemporary building into a true form of the required architectural style, consistent with the City's Design Guidelines, or to provide pedestrian-oriented elements. It is not the intent of the Architectural Overlay District to prevent minor building improvements, additions, maintenance, etc., from occurring. The following should be considered when remodeling a building: 
a.  In reviewing additions to existing buildings which do not have the required architectural style and/or not pedestrian-oriented, the review authority shall determine whether or not it is practical for the existing buildings to be converted to a true form of the architecture required by this section and/or to provide pedestrian-oriented elements. 
b.  In cases where only minor modifications are proposed, the goals shall be the following: 
i.  To improve the architectural quality of the building, consistent with the architectural style required by this section; 
ii.  To include design elements that are in character with the required architectural style, where practical; 
iii.  To include as many pedestrian-oriented elements, such as courtyards, paseos, outdoor eating areas, landscaping, interesting architectural details, etc., as is practical. 
Minor modifications are changes that leave the existing building essentially intact and are primarily cosmetic (e.g., paint, re-stucco, enlarged windows, small additions). 
Minor remodels are required to comply with the standards of the underlying zoning designation, and the general Design Guidelines in the City's Design Guidelines. If the building being remodeled is Spanish Colonial Revival, or if Spanish Colonial Revival elements would complement the building and are practical, then the section of the City's Design Guidelines pertaining to Spanish Colonial Revival architecture should be used to guide minor changes. When practical, the guidelines for pedestrian districts contained in the City's Design Guidelines should also be used. 
c.  For all major remodels, projects shall have the required architectural style per subsection E and pedestrian-orientation unless it can be demonstrated that it is impractical to do so. Major remodels are changes that significantly alter a building's design (e.g., additions that significantly change the footprint of the building, the addition of new stories, new roof design, etc.). 
Major remodels are required to comply with all relevant sections of the City's Design Guidelines, particularly the section for pedestrian districts, as well as the development standards for underlying zoning designation. If Spanish Colonial Revival architecture is required, major remodels are also required to comply with relevant sections of the City's Design Guidelines for Spanish Colonial Revival architecture.

17.56.030 - Central Business (-CB) Overlay District. 
A.  Purpose and Intent . The Central Business [CB] Overlay is also known as Pedestrian [P] Overlay in the General Plan and as the Visitor Serving Commercial District [VSCD] Overlay in the Coastal Land Use Plan. The purpose of the Central Business District (CB) Overlay designation is to signify core commercial and mixed-use districts in which the City will require pedestrian uses to be located in pedestrian spaces (on the street level of the project along the sidewalk/street), thereby facilitating visitor-serving uses and pedestrian activity along sidewalks and throughout the area. This overlay was created in order to protect existing coastal visitor-serving commercial, recreational, dining, and lodging uses and provide new areas for such uses. It sets aside certain commercial areas to ensure adequate sites to accommodate the provision of additional new visitor-serving commercial and lodging development in the Coastal Zone. This goal is to be achieved by reviewing all uses requiring discretionary review for their appropriateness in pedestrian spaces. The City recognizes that the market for pedestrian uses in the CB Overlay fluctuates and, as such, provides this discretionary review process for the approval of non-pedestrian uses in pedestrian spaces. As the market for pedestrian uses increases in the CB Overlay area, the approval of non-pedestrian uses in pedestrian spaces should diminish. 
B.  Applicability . The provisions in this section apply to development within the - CBCB Overlay. 
C.  Permitted and Conditionally Permitted Uses . Within the CB Overlay, the appropriateness of the location of nonpedestrian-oriented uses, as defined below, in pedestrian-oriented space, as defined below, shall be considered as part of the discretionary review process for the use, as indicated in the use table in Chapter 17.40, Mixed-Use Zones and Standards, of this title. 
1.  Definitions. 
a.  Pedestrian-oriented uses. Pedestrian-oriented uses facilitate a relatively high level of pedestrian activity. Examples of pedestrian-oriented uses include retail shops; restaurants; entertainment; commercial services such as banks, cleaners, electronic repair shops; offices such as optometrists with retail space and realtors; the common areas of lodging facilities such as lobbies, restaurants, and shops; public uses such as postal offices and parks; and other similar uses. 
b.  Nonpedestrian-oriented uses. Nonpedestrian-oriented uses facilitate relatively little pedestrian activity. Examples of nonpedestrian-oriented uses include most professional offices, such as insurance agencies, secretarial services and telemarketing services; medical uses such as doctor's, dentist's and veterinary offices and optometrists without retail space; guest rooms in lodging facilities; and other similar uses. 
c.  Pedestrian-oriented space shall be commercial space on the street level of a project which meets either of the following criteria: 
i.  Individual commercial space with a wall which is contiguous with the front property line; or 
ii.  Individual commercial space with an entrance located within 15 feet of the front property line. 
2.  Required Findings. In addition to the general findings listed for the discretionary process required for the application, one of the following findings shall be made: 
a.  The use sufficiently generates pedestrian activity to be appropriate in a pedestrian-oriented space; or 
b.  Current market conditions make it reasonably necessary to allow a use that does not generate significant pedestrian activity in order for the subject space to remain occupied. 
(Ord. 1314 § 57, 2006; Ord. 1252 § 13, 2001) 
(Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
17.56.040 - Planned Residential District (-PRD) Overlay. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Planned Residential District (-PRD) Overlay is to provide flexible regulations in order to foster innovation, variety, amenities, and a sensitivity to the natural topography in residential development. The intent is to allow development to deviate from conventional residential standards to achieve higher quality rather than increased density. 
B.  Applicability. The provisions in this section apply to all areas with the Planned Residential District (-PRD) designation. 
C.  Adoption and Amendment of the Planned Residential Overlay District (-PRD). 
1.  Adoption and amendment of the -PRD Overlay on any properties shall occur in accordance with the provisions described in Section 17.16.040, Zoning Amendments, of this title. 
2.  Adoption of the -PRD Overlay shall require the concurrent approval of a Site Plan Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.050, Site Plan Permits and Minor Site Plan Permits, of this title, as well as the concurrent approval of a tentative map, if property is being subdivided, in accordance with the City's Subdivision Ordinance. 
3.  Prior to submitting an application for adoption of the -PRD Overlay, the applicant or prospective developer shall schedule a preapplication review conference with the City Planner. Please refer to Section 17.12.030, Preapplication Review, of this title for the general purpose and intent of preapplication review. 
Following the preapplication conference, the City Planner shall provide the applicant with written comments summarizing the initial major issues and conclusions resulting from the conference. 
4.  Please refer to Sections 17.12.040, Filing an Application, 17.12.050, Application Completeness, and 17.12.060, Applications Requiring Additional Information, of this title for the application requirements for all discretionary applications. 
5.  The adoption of the -PRD Overlay for a development shall result in the underlying zoning designation and the -PRD Overlay becoming the official zoning designation for the development (such as RL-PRD, for a PRD in the RL zone). In addition, -PRD designations shall be numbered, in sequence of adoption, and their specific zoning requirements added to the appendix to this title when the -PRD standards differ from those in Subsection (F), Development Standards, of this section. 
D.  General Requirements. The -PRD Overlay may be requested for land complying with both the following provisions: 
1.  The land is zoned RL, RML, RM and RH; 
2.  The project has a minimum site area of five acres. 
E.  Use Regulations. The uses allowed in a Planned Residential District shall be limited to those uses allowed in the underlying zoning designation. 
F.  Development Standards. 
1.  General Development Standards. Table 17.56.040, Planned Residential District Standards, lists the site development standards required for planned residential development projects. Additional common amenities such as, but not limited to, an increase in common open space, clustering of dwelling units and a general conservation in the amount of land utilized for development may be required through the Site Plan Permit process.

(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.56.050 - Coastal Zone (-CZ) Overlay District. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Coastal Zone (-CZ) Overlay is to provide standards which preserve and protect the coastal resources within San Clemente, and implement the coastal policies in the City's Coastal Element and the California Coastal Act (Division 20 of the Public Resources Code). The Coastal Zone is an overlay which may be combined with any other zone that lies within the Coastal Zone of San Clemente. 
B.  Applicability. The provisions in this section apply to development within the -CZ Overlay. For purposes of this section, bluff, canyon, beach front standards shall apply to those bluffs, canyons, and beach front lots identified on the Zoning Map. 
C.  Permitted and Conditional Uses. Permitted and conditional uses within the -CZ Overlay are the same uses as those allowed within the underlying base zones. Please refer to the permitted and conditional use tables in Chapters 17.32, Residential Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards, of this title. 
D.  Development Standards. In addition to the development standards for the base zone described in Chapters 17.32, Residential Zones and Standards, through 17.48, Public Zones and Standards, of this title, the following standards apply to all applicable projects, as indicated in the subsection below, within the -CZ Overlay. The purpose of the coastal standards is to protect coastal resources and reduce hazards to life and property. When there are two or more setback choices available in the standards below (e.g., stringline and bluff or canyon edge setback), the City Planner shall determine which of the setbacks shall be applied to a development based on the geology, soil, topography, existing vegetation, public views, adjacent development and other site characteristics, subject to the appeals provisions of Section 17.12.140, Appeals of an Action, of this title. The setbacks below are minimum setbacks that may be altered to require greater setbacks when required or recommended as a result of a geotechnical review. No development shall be permitted within the setbacks provided below except for as provided in Subsection (D)(7), Exceptions to the Standards, of this section. 
1.  Coastal Bluff Setback. Proposed development on coastal bluff lots (refer to Zoning Map) shall be set back: 
a.  At least 25 feet from the bluff edge (see Subsection (D)(5), Determination of Bluff, Canyon or Cliff Edge); or 
b.  In accordance with a stringline drawn between the nearest corners of adjacent structures on either side of the development (see Subsection (D)(4), Infill Development). 
c.  Ancillary improvements, such as at-grade decks, walls, fences, retaining walls, patio covers, and other accessory structures, as determined by the City Planner, may encroach into the 25-foot bluff edge setback to a minimum of 10 feet from the bluff edge. 
New permanent structures shall not be permitted on a bluff face, except for engineered staircases or accessways to provide public beach access where no feasible alternative means of public access exists. Drainage devices extending over or down the bluff face will not be permitted if the property can be drained away from the bluff face. Drainpipes will be allowed only where no other less environmentally damaging drain system is feasible and the drainpipes are designed and placed to minimize impacts to the bluff face, toe, and beach. 
2.  Coastal Canyon Setback. New development shall not encroach into coastal canyons and shall be set back: 
a.  A minimum of 30 percent of the depth of the lot and not less than 15 feet from the canyon edge; or 
b.  A minimum of 30 percent of the depth of the lot and set back from the primary vegetation line (not less than 15 feet from coastal sage scrub vegetation or not less than 50 feet from riparian vegetation); or 
c.  In accordance with house and deck/patio stringlines drawn between the nearest corners of adjacent structures. Only like structures/development shall be utilized when determining a stringline setback for proposed development (see Subsection (D)(4), Infill Development (stringline) of this section). 
d.  Ancillary improvements, such as at-grade decks, walls, fences, retaining walls, patio covers, and other accessory structures, as determined by the City Planner, may encroach into the 15-foot canyon edge setback to a minimum of five feet from the canyon edge. 
Drainage devices extending into the canyon will be allowed only when 100 percent site drainage to the street is not practical, to be determined by the City Engineer. Drainpipes are to be designed and placed to minimize impacts to the canyon, including visual impacts. Where practical, when extensions are made to existing drainpipes, the entire length of pipe shall be brought into conformance with this section. Drainpipes must be reviewed and in-concept approved by the City Engineer and City Planner, or their designees, before being sent to the California Coastal Commission for approval. 
Adequate visual impact mitigation may include color of original pipe, painting of pipe to blend with natural surroundings, screening of pipe using vegetation and other natural land features, or any other method deemed appropriate by the City Planner. 
3.  Coastal Beach Front Setback. Proposed development on a beach front lot shall be set back: 
a.  In accordance with a stringline (see Subsection (D)(4), Infill Development); or 
b.  In accordance with the underlying zoning district setback. 
4.  Infill Development (Stringline). When new construction along a coastal canyon, bluff or beach front is infill development and is consistent with the policies of the City of San Clemente Coastal Element Land Use Plan, the following setback standards shall be applied: 
a.  No part of a proposed new deck/patio shall be built farther toward a bluff edge, canyon edge, or beach front than a line drawn between the nearest adjacent corners of the adjacent deck/patios (deck stringline); and 
b.  No part of a proposed new structure's living space shall be built farther toward a bluff edge, canyon edge, or beach front than a line drawn between the nearest adjacent corners of the adjacent structures' living space (house stringline). 
The illustration below depicts how the two different stringlines are used. If the adjacent lot is vacant, a stringline shall not be used. 
Figure 17.56.050 
 
5.  Determination of Bluff, Canyon or Cliff Edge. All development applications for projects adjacent to a bluff, cliff or canyon edge shall provide a topographic survey of the property which indicates the bluff, canyon or cliff edge. The topographic survey shall be prepared by a licensed surveyor or registered civil engineer. The edge location shall be drawn in accordance with the definition for "edge" as defined in Chapter 17.88, Definitions, of this title, under coastal zone definitions. 
If after reviewing the topographic survey, the City Planner determines that the location of the bluff, canyon or cliff edge has not been drawn in accordance with the definition of "edge," the City may stake the bluff, canyon or cliff edge in the field. Once the edge is staked a licensed surveyor or registered civil engineer shall survey the location of the stakes and transfer the stakes coordinates onto the topographic survey. This information shall then be used to accurately establish the edge of bluff on the topographic survey and project site plan. 
6.  Coastal Bluff and Canyon Preservation. 
a.  Landscaping. Landscaping in coastal canyon setback areas or the coastal bluff setback areas, as defined in the subsections above, shall be primarily composed of native plant species. The removal of native plant species and the introduction of nonnative plant species in the canyons shall be discouraged. The use of native plant species in and adjacent to the canyons shall be encouraged. 
b.  Landscape thinning and clearing within Costal Canyons and Bluffs, including setback areas as defined in the subsections above, for areas located within 30 feet of any habitable structure or parking garage, shall be allowed when done in accordance with the following criteria: 
i.  Dead and dying plants, leaves and similar debris shall be removed. 
ii.  Non-native (also termed as ornamental or exotic) vegetation may be removed. 
iii.  Vegetation located next to or under combustible structures shall be removed. 
iv.  30 feet shall be provided between the building and native (also defined as non-ornamental or non-exotic), non-irrigated vegetation, unless the vegetation is on a slope, in which case the native, non-irrigated plants shall be trimmed and thinned while retaining root structures in place for slope and soil stability. Where root zone is not sufficiently established, to be determined by the City Engineer, alternative measures for slope and soil stability may be required, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and Coastal Commission staff. 
v.  Best Management Practices (BMPs) must be utilized to prevent any discharge of soil, vegetation or other material to the storm drain system (including natural canyons, area drains, streets, gutters, catch basins, pipes, channels or receiving waters) in compliance with the municipal storm water permit issued by the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board, the city's local implementation plan and the Orange County Drainage area management plan. 
c.  Landscape thinning and clearing within Coastal Canyons and Bluffs, including setback areas as defined in the subsections above, for areas located within 100 feet of any habitable structure or parking garage, shall be allowed when done in accordance with the following criteria: 
i.  Dead and dying plants, leaves and similar debris shall be removed. 
ii.  Non-native (also termed as ornamental or exotic) vegetation may be removed. 
iii.  Nominal trimming of native vegetation is allowed. In no case shall plants be trimmed down to the root stalk, unless in-concept approved by the City Planner and approved by the California Coastal Commission. 
iv.  Best Management Practices (BMPs) must be utilized to prevent any discharge of soil, vegetation or other material to the storm drain system (including natural canyons, area drains, streets, gutters, catch basins, pipes, channels or receiving waters) in compliance with the municipal storm water permit issued by the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board, the city's local implementation plan and the Orange County Drainage area maintenance plan. 
d.  New landscaping and landscape modification, other than as described above, must be in-concept approved by the City Planner and reviewed and approved by the California Coastal Commission. 
e.  Subdivision. Any subdivision of property in or adjacent to coastal bluffs and/or coastal canyons shall be reviewed for consistency with the coastal bluff and canyon preservation policies. New parcels that do not have an adequate building site area to comply with the setback standards of these policies shall not be created. 
f.  Review of Projects: 
i.  Projects Requiring Site Plan Review. Review of all projects within the Coastal Zone requiring Site Plan Permit Review or Conditional Use Permit review shall include an assessment of the potential impact on natural habitat areas. Site plan review of all development projects located adjacent to parks and recreation areas shall include an evaluation of potential impacts on coastal bluffs and coastal canyons. 
ii.  Mitigation measures identified during site plan review stages to limit a project's effect on the coastal bluff or coastal canyon environment shall be incorporated into final project design plans. 
iii.  Large-Scale Projects. The analysis and evaluation of large-scale development projects shall include a comprehensive inventory of biological resources. A determination should be made of the area's importance as a native habitat, including identification of rare or endangered species, or those species being considered to be listed as rare or endangered. 
7.  Exceptions to the Standards of this Section. Exceptions to the standards in this section shall not require the approval of a variance and shall be permitted by the City of San Clemente, if all of the following occur: 
a.  The exception is for an addition to an existing structure; 
b.  The exception is approved by the Coastal Commission; and 
c.  The City of San Clemente has no objections to the exception. 
E.  Replacement of Affordable Housing Units. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. This subsection is intended to provide standards to implement affordable housing requirements, related to the replacement of existing affordable units in the Coastal Zone, included in the City's Housing Element and the State Government Code Section 65590. 
2.  Applicability. 
a.  Applicable Projects. This subsection shall apply to the conversion to condominiums or demolition of three or more dwelling units within the Coastal Zone, where at least one of the units was occupied by an eligible household, as defined in the City's Housing Element. 
b.  Exempt Projects. This subsection shall not apply to projects meeting any of the following criteria, unless the City determines that the replacement of all or any portion of the converted or demolished dwelling unit is feasible: 
i.  The conversion or demolition of a residential structure which contains less than three dwelling units, or in the event that a proposed conversion or demolition involves more than one residential structure, the conversion or demolition of 10 or fewer dwelling units; 
ii.  The conversion or demolition of a residential structure to a nonresidential use which is "coastal dependent" or "coastal related" as defined in Public Resources Code 30101 as amended, and consistent with the underlying zone; 
iii.  The demolition of a residential structure which has been declared a public nuisance. 
c.  Determination of Applicability. The Planning Division shall determine whether units to be converted or demolished are occupied by Eligible Households. This determination may be based upon an income survey of current residents. A dwelling unit need not be replaced if either of the following criteria apply: 
i.  The dwelling unit is not occupied by an eligible household. For purposes of this subsection, a residential dwelling shall be deemed occupied by a person or family if the person or family was evicted from that dwelling unit within one year prior to the filing of an application to convert or demolish the unit and if the eviction was for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this subsection. 
ii.  A survey of the residents of the units is infeasible, based on the City Planner's determination. 
The Planning Division shall make its determination, and inform the developer of the number of below market rate rental units to be provided, as required in Subdivision 3, Standards, of this section, within 60 days of receipt of a complete application. 
3.  Standards. 
a.  Requirement to Provide Affordable Housing. Dwelling units located in the Coastal Zone Overlay which are to be demolished or converted to condominiums, and which are occupied by "eligible households" shall be replaced.

1.  Prohibition of Landform Alterations. Grading, cutting or filling that will materially alter coastal bluffs, canyons, and cliffs shall be prohibited unless approved by the City and one of the following findings made: 
a.  Alterations to a coastal bluff, canyon or cliff are required for compelling reasons of public safety (e.g., grading work necessary for stabilization of the coastal bluffs adjacent to the Pacific Coast Highway which without stabilization would threaten life and property); or 
b.  The alterations are required to provide a significant overriding coastal public benefit (e.g., staircases or accessways to provide beach access to the public where none previously existed). 
2.  Standards for Permitted Landform Alterations. 
a.  Where permitted, alterations of bluffs, canyons and cliffs shall comply with all of the following standards: 
i.  Any landform alteration proposed for reasons of public safety or public benefit shall minimize the extent of the grading to the maximum extent feasible. In the areas where the natural landform is impacted (e.g., bluffs, cliffs, ravines) the stabilization method used shall be visually compatible with the coastal landform (e.g., land-form or contour grading, artificial sculptured bluff face that matches the natural bluff, etc.). 
ii.  Drought tolerant plants and efficient irrigation shall be required for landscaping to minimize water consumption, fertilization and chemical application, and to visually relate development to existing natural landscapes. Grading shall not alter the biological integrity of the sensitive habitat areas unless it is replaced with habitat of equal or greater value. 
iii.  Development shall be conducted with provisions for the control of sediment transport, and debris originating at the construction site or upstream property as follows: 
(A)  For necessary grading operations, the smallest practical area of land will be exposed at any one time during development, and the length of exposure will be kept to the minimum practical amount of time. The clearing of land shall be avoided during the winter rainy season with all measures for removing sediments and stabilizing slopes required in place before the beginning of the rainy season. 
(B)  Sediment basins (including debris basins, desalting basins or silt traps) shall be installed in conjunction with the initial grading operations and maintained current to site development through the development process to remove sediment from runoff waters. All debris and sediments shall be retained on site unless removed to an appropriate dumping location approved by the City Engineer. 
(C)  Temporary vegetation, seeding, mulching or other suitable stabilization method will be used to protect against soil erosion on slope during grading or development. All cut and fill slopes shall be stabilized immediately with planting of native grasses and shrubs, appropriate nonnative plants or with accepted landscaping practices. 
(D)  Provisions shall be made to conduct surface water to storm drains or suitable watercourses to prevent erosion. Drainage devices shall be designed to accommodate increased runoff resulting from modified soil and surface conditions as a result of development.

The number of off-street parking spaces required for the land uses identified in the Permitted and Conditional Use Tables of this title are listed in Table 17.64.050, Number of Parking Spaces Required, except where parking requirements are established in Chapter 17.28, Special Uses, or exceptions to these requirements are granted in accordance with Section 17.64.125, Waivers of Parking Requirements, in this chapter. 
2.  Uses Not Listed. When parking requirements for land uses are not specifically listed in this section or in Chapter 17.28, Special Uses, the parking requirements shall be those required for the most similar use. The most similar use shall be determined by the City Planner as provided for in Section 17.04.040, Interpretations, subject to the concurrent review and appeal provisions contained in Section 17.12.090, Consideration of Concurrent Applications, and Section 17.12.140, Appeals of an Action, of this title. 
3.  New Buildings Without Tenants. If the type of tenants that will occupy a nonresidential building, or the nonresidential portion of a mixed-use building, is not known at the time the new building is being proposed, the number of parking spaces required for the nonresidential uses will be determined through the discretionary review process. Through the discretionary review process, conditions may be placed on the type of future tenant allowed to ensure the parking provided for the project will be adequate. 
4.  Mixed-Use Sites. When several uses/businesses occupy a single structure or parcel, the total parking required shall be the sum of the requirements for each individual use, except as otherwise provided in Subsection (A)(5), Mixed-Function Uses, below, and Section 17.64.120, Shared Parking, in this chapter. 
5.  Mixed-Function Uses. When a building or tenant space is occupied by a single use, but the use contains several functions, such as sales, office and storage, parking spaces shall be provided based on the gross floor area of occupied tenant space(s), as required in Table 17.64.050, Number of Parking Spaces Required. Exceptions: Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the City Planner for buildings or tenant spaces which meet one of the following criteria: 
a.  One of the functions is a restaurant. 
b.  Each function generates significant parking demand so parking requirements should be applied to each function individually. 
6.  Alterations of Use. 
a.  For changes of use when the required number of parking spaces is not provided. refer to Chapter 17.72.060.C.2, Changes of Use, of this Title. 
b.  Parking spaces are waived per Section 17.64.125, Waivers of Parking Requirements. 
c.  Uses are proposed in Mixed Use Zoning districts within the Central Business Overlay, the number of off-street parking spaces shall be provided for an alteration of use or addition of square footage based on the net increase in parking spaces required for the alteration or addition of square footage. For example, if an existing retail establishment currently requiring four parking spaces wishes to convert to a restaurant requiring seven parking spaces, the net increase in parking requirements is three spaces. To be permitted by the City, the restaurant in this example would have to be able to cover the net increase of three parking spaces. 
7.  Rounding of Numbers. When the required number of parking spaces is other than a whole number, the total number of spaces shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number, unless otherwise provided for in this title. Exceptions in this title include provisions: 1) for mixed-use projects on lots of 6,000 square feet or smaller and requiring less than 5 parking spaces, Section 17.40.050(C)(1)(d), Total Parking Space Requirement for Mixed-use Projects on Lots 6,000 square feet or smaller, of this title; and 2) for three or more dwelling units on a single lot in Table 17.64.050, Number of Parking Spaces Required, of this title. 
8.  More than One Parking Ratio. Where more than one parking ratio is shown for a particular use, the required number of spaces shall be the total of all ratios shown. For instance, the parking requirement for bed and breakfast inns is "1 per unit, 2 for the owner's unit." The total parking requirement for a bed and breakfast inn is the sum of the required parking for the units and two spaces for the owner's unit. 
B.  Number of Parking Spaces Required. The number of off-street parking spaces required for various land uses shall be as listed in Table 17.64.050, Number of Parking Spaces Required, except for those listed in Chapter 17.28, Special Uses. Unless otherwise indicated, the parking requirements are for square feet of gross floor area occupied by the use and, in the case of nonresidential uses, include the parking required for customers and employees. Exception: Where a portion of a structure is used for automobile parking, that portion shall not be counted in calculating the required parking for the structure. If parking is eliminated and the space is occupied by another use, parking shall be required for the use as indicated for the use in this chapter.

(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996; Ord. No. 1664 , § 45, 9-18-2018)  
17.64.080 - Boat, Trailer, and Oversized Vehicle Parking on Residentially Zoned or Developed Properties. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The parking restrictions set forth in this section are designed to provide for parking for boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles to improve the appearance and aesthetic values of the City's residential areas and residentially developed properties, and to further eliminate or prevent the occurrence of potential traffic hazards. 
B.  Applicability. This section shall apply to the parking of all boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles on all residentially zoned and residentially developed properties. With the exception of Subsection (E), Partial-Screening Required, Subsection (F), Parking Space Surfacing and Maintenance, and Subsection (G)(3), Modifications to the Minimum Height for Partial Screening, this section shall become operative on January 14, 2000. Subsection (F), Parking Space Surfacing and Maintenance, shall become operative on January 14, 2001. Subsection (E), Partial-Screening Required, and Subsection (G)(3), Modifications to the Minimum Height for Partial-Screening, shall become operative on January 14, 2003. 
C.  Setbacks. 
1.  Standard. All boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles parked on residentially zoned or residentially developed property, including oversized vehicles parked in driveways, shall be parked a minimum of 20 feet from the back of any curb or, if no curb exists, from the edge of any improved street. 
2.  Exceptions: This 20-foot setback shall not apply when: 
a.  The boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle is parked in any area within a garage or carport or within a legal enclosure or behind a fence or wall which totally shields such boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle from view from the adjacent street; or 
b.  The oversized vehicle is required for the daily use of an individual who is disabled, in accordance with Subsection (G)(1) of this section; or 
c.  The boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle is parked for temporary loading and unloading, in accordance with Subsection (G)(2) of this section. 
D.  Parking in Driveways. The only oversized vehicles that shall be allowed to be parked in required driveways shall be oversized vehicles that are self-powered and operable. Boats and trailers shall not be parked in required driveways. For the purposes of this section, the required driveway is that portion of the driveway determined to be required to provide access to the garage, carport, or other legally required off-street parking area for vehicles on the property, pursuant to the City's driveway standards on file in the Office of the City Engineer. 
E.  Partial-Screening Required. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to address the potential aesthetic impacts of boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles that are parked outside the required driveway and that are visible from the street. The regulations in this subsection are meant to result in fences, walls, and hedges that partially block the view of boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles from vantage points along street-side property lines of the property on which the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle is parked. The intent of this subsection is to require partial, and not full screening, from both vertical and horizontal perspectives of the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle. The screening required by this section is partial from a vertical perspective, because most boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles exceed the maximum height of the fence, wall or hedge required in this subsection. The screening required by this subsection is partial from a horizontal perspective because: (1) this subsection requires screening from views along the street-side property line of the subject property, not along the entire street; and (2) this subsection does not require that fences, walls, or hedges be 100 percent opaque. The City recognizes the desirability, for aesthetic purposes, of allowing a variety of opaqueness and materials to be used to satisfy the fence, wall, and hedge requirements. 
2.  Standards. All boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles shall be partially screened by fences, walls, or hedges which comply with City standards, Section 17.24.090, Fences, Walls, and Hedges, and meet the following standards: 
a.  Height. Fences, walls, and hedges provided for partial screening shall be six feet in height, unless granted an exception by the Community Development Director, as provided for in Subsection (G)(3) of this section. 
b.  Location. The fence, wall, or hedge shall be located between any visible portion of the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle and the entire length of any street-side property line of the property on which the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle is located. 
c.  Opaqueness. Fences, walls, or hedges must be at least 50 percent opaque, as viewed from a line perpendicular to the fence, wall, or hedge. Open fencing, such as wrought iron, may be used for partial screening, if combined with other materials or plantings to achieve at least 50 percent opacity. 
3.  Exceptions. The requirements of this subsection shall not apply when: 
a.  The boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle is parked in any area within a garage or carport or within a legal enclosure or behind a fence or wall which totally shields such boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle from view from the adjacent street; or 
b.  The oversized vehicle is located entirely on the required driveway, in accordance with Subsection D of this section. When an oversized vehicle is located partially on the required driveway, the entire oversized vehicle shall be partially screened in accordance with the provisions of this subsection; or 
c.  The oversized vehicle is required for the daily use of an individual who is disabled, in accordance with Subsection (G)(1) of this section; 
d.  The boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle is parked for temporary loading and unloading, in accordance with Subsection (G)(2) of this section. 
F.  Parking Space Surfacing and Maintenance. All parking spaces for boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles, shall be: 
1.  Covered with an all-weather surface, as deemed appropriate by the City Planner; and 
2.  Kept clean and free of dust, mud, and trash. Surfacing shall be maintained in a continuous state of good repair, as determined by the City Planner. 
G.  Exceptions. 
1.  Vehicles for the Disabled. Vehicles displaying license plates or placards issued pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 5007, 22511.55 or 22511.59 shall be exempt from the setback and partial-screening provisions of this Section (Subsections (C) and (E)). The requirements contained in subsections C and E shall not be applicable to any vehicles which meet both of the following requirements: 
a.  The vehicle is properly displaying a disabled persons special identification license plate issued under Vehicle Code Sections 5007, 22511.55 or 22511.59; and 
b.  The owner has filed with the City Clerk of the City of San Clemente written authorization from a duly licensed medical doctor noting that the oversized vehicle is reasonably necessary to accommodate the individual's daily needs. 
2.  Temporary Parking for Loading and Unloading. Boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles parked in a driveway for the purpose of loading and unloading shall be exempt from the setback requirements (Subsection (C)) and partial screening requirements (Subsection (E)) of this section for a maximum of six round-trips per calendar year. It is the intent of this subsection that the provisions for loading and unloading be granted solely for boats, trailers, and oversized vehicles, owned or rented by the residents of the property on which the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle, is being parked. For the purpose of this section, a round-trip shall mean one 48-hour period for the loading of the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle, and one 48-hour period for the unloading of the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle. With the exception of RV Parking Extension Roundtrips allowed in Section 10.28.230 of the Municipal Code, no two round-trips shall be allowed within a three-day period. At the expiration of each 48-hour period, the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle, shall be moved to a location that complies with all the provisions of this section. 
3.  Modifications to the Minimum Height for Partial Screening. The minimum fence, wall, or hedge height for partial screening may be reduced to 42 inches with the approval of the Community Development Director, if the Community Development Director determines that all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle is located on an area of the lot which does not permit fences over 42 inches in height, in accordance with the height limits for fences, walls, and hedges found in Section 17.24.090(B), Standards; and 
b.  Location of the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle to an area of the lot which would allow partial-screening that is six feet tall would be impractical or economically infeasible, that is, it would impose costs on the applicant which are excessive in light of the purchase costs of the boat, trailer, or oversized vehicle; and 
c.  The applicant's inability to satisfy the minimum height requirements for partial screening is not the result of the applicant maintaining his or her property in a manner which renders it impossible to satisfy the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. 1235 § 3, 1999: Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.64.090 - Tandem ParkingResidential Uses. 
Duplexes which meet parking requirements with tandem parking spaces shall comply with the following requirements: 
A.  Curb Break. No greater than a 16-foot curb break shall be provided. Any deviation from this width shall be subject to a minor exception permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.090, Minor Exception Permits, of this title, with concurrent approval from the City Engineer. 
B.  Garage Size, Minimum. A minimum two-car garage not less than 18 by 38 feet shall be provided. 
C.  Setbacks for Parking. 
1.  Setback for Uncovered Parking. All uncovered parking spaces shall meet a minimum front yard setback of 18 feet.

17.64.100 - In-Lieu Certificates for Off-Street Parking. 
A.  Sale of In-Lieu Certificates. The City Council may authorize the sale of in-lieu certificates for off-street parking to owners of the property who make the showing required under Subsection (B), Required Showing, of this section. The City Council shall adopt a resolution or resolutions creating in-lieu parking districts within the City, setting forth both the boundaries of such districts and the applicable in-lieu fee within each district. Such fees shall be based upon the cost of providing the necessary parking facilities within the applicable district. The boundaries of each district and the fee for the in-lieu certificates therein may be adjusted from time to time as the City Council sees fit. 
B.  Required Showing. The applicant shall show to the satisfaction of the City Council that the sale of in-lieu certificates is necessary because there is not available space to provide the requisite amount of off-street parking and the project cannot be reasonably redesigned to accommodate such parking without extreme hardship. The owner of the property for which the parking certificate(s) is approved shall be required to purchase and retain one certificate for each required parking space not provided in accordance with the minimum requirements of the San Clemente Zoning Ordinance. All certificates purchased shall run with the property and shall not be transferable to another property. 
C.  Use of Funds. All moneys paid for certificates shall be deposited with the City and expenditures from the fund shall be used solely to purchase land and make improvements for public parking within the in-lieu district from which the money was obtained. 
D.  Method of Sale. The City Council shall have the right to authorize the sale of in-lieu certificates subject to the following minimum requirements:

In all nonresidential and mixed-use zones, private parking facilities may be shared by multiple uses whose activities are not normally conducted during the same hours, or when hours of peak use vary. The applicant shall have the burden of proof for a reduction in the total number of required off-street parking spaces. 
A.  Review Requirements. 
1.  Existing Buildings with Change of Use [Except a Change to a Mixed Use (Residential/Commercial on the Same Site)]. Shared parking may be granted through the approval of a Minor Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.070, Minor Conditional Use Permits, of this title, subject to the requirements and findings in subsections (B) and (C) of this section. 
2.  New Mixed Use (Residential/Commercial on Same Site) Buildings.

C.  Findings. 
1.  Given the specific conditions of the site and the adjacent area, the shared parking arrangement will not result in inadequate parking; and 
2.  The number of parking spaces required for the site, in accordance with Section 17.64.050(B), Number of Parking Spaces Required, is provided through the shared parking arrangement, based on varied hours of operation and/or combinations of peak and oft-peak uses. Exceptions: The following findings may be substituted for this finding in the specific situations described below: 
a.  In the case of sites/projects that are already nonconforming as to the number of parking spaces provided, the following finding may be made: 
The shared parking arrangement does not intensify the nonconformity, and/or any intensification can be accommodated because of varied hours of operation and/or combinations of peak and off-peak uses. 
b.  In the case of the Downtown Parking Study Area, the following finding may be made: 
The number of spaces to be shared has been demonstrated to be physically available (not occupied) for the proposed use(s), during the hours of operation of the proposed use(s). 
(Ord. 1308 § 15, 2006; Ord. 1190 § 16, 1997: Ord. 1182 § 15, 1997; Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996) 
(Ord. No. 1594, § 3(Exh. A, § 39), 5-5-2015)  
17.64.125 - Waivers of Parking Requirements. 
A.  The Downtown Parking Study Area. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. The Parking Waiver Program for the Downtown Parking Study Area is designed to serve the unique characteristics of this area which influence parking demand. The Parking Study Area contains a significant number of public parking spaces which absorb the overflow parking from private parking lots and substitute for private parking. In addition, the existing mix of land uses is varied, with retail and office uses, public services, service-oriented businesses and some residential uses. The variety of land uses in the area, the incorporation of residential uses into commercial projects, the varied peak parking demand periods that they create, their proximity to one another, and the pedestrian-orientation of the area result in a shared or joint-use of the available public parking. All of these factors reduce the parking demand from that experienced by many types of commercial areas. A parking study completed in 1995, on which this program is partially based, confirmed the unique parking circumstances in the Downtown Parking Study Area. 
The Parking Waiver Program was developed to address the reduced parking demand experienced within the study area. The program has been designed so that waivers are not automatic; rather, they require discretionary action on the part of the City. Waivers are to be granted based on the availability of public parking near the proposed project and on the project's contribution to the pedestrian atmosphere of the Downtown Parking Study Area. The availability of private parking near a project is not a basis for granting waivers. In the development of this program, the City recognizes that each block within the Parking Study Area is unique, with its own set of circumstances related to public parking availability, parking demand, pedestrian-orientation and mix of uses. These individual circumstances shall be taken into consideration when waivers requests are evaluated. 
Property owners in the Downtown Parking Study Area (see Figure 17.64.125, Downtown Parking Study Area) may request waivers of their off-street parking requirement for nonresidential development in accordance with the provisions found in this section. 
Figure 17.64.125 
 
2.  Review Requirements. 
a.  Waivers for Alterations of Use. Waivers of the parking requirements for alterations of use, except for outdoor dining, may be allowed by the following authorities, subject to the concurrent review provisions of Section 17.12.090, Consideration of Concurrent Applications, and the findings in Subsection (A)(3) of this section, through the indicated applications:

b.  Waivers for Outdoor Dining, Additions and New Structures. The waiver of some or all parking requirements for outdoor dining, additions to existing structures, and new structures shall be reviewed by the approval body required to review other aspects of the outdoor dining facility, addition or new structure, in accordance with Chapter 17.16, Applications, of this title and subject to the findings of Subsection (A)(4) of this section. An application for a waiver shall be filed and processed in the following manner: 
i.  When only ministerial, City Planner, or Community Development Director review of the project is required, the parking waiver shall be reviewed by the Community Development Director through the plan check process. 
ii.  When Zoning Administrator review of the project is required, the applicant shall process and obtain a Minor Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.070, Minor Conditional Use Permits, of this title, for the parking waiver request. 
iii.  When Planning Commission review of the project is required, the applicant shall process and obtain a Conditional Use Permit, in accordance with Section 17.16.060, Conditional Use Permits, of this title, for the parking waiver request. 
3.  Limitations on Waiver Requests. 
a.  For the Downtown Parking Study Area. The City may approve up to 90 parking waivers in the Downtown Parking Study Area. Parking waivers may be granted for alterations of use and new nonresidential development. After 90 waivers have been granted, the City shall consider whether an additional parking study is necessary to assure that granting of an additional 90 waivers, for a total of 180, will not create inadequate parking in the study area. For the most recent count on parking waivers available, contact the Planning Division. 
b.  For an Individual Project Site. The City may approve parking waivers for an individual project site, subject to the following limitations: 
i.  No project site may be granted more than 10 parking space waivers. 
ii.  The limitation on the total number of waivers which the City may grant to an individual project site is cumulative, beginning with the effective date of this amendment to the City's Zoning Ordinance. 
iii.  Should the use or addition for which the parking waiver is granted be terminated or demolished, the parking waivers shall revert back to the City and shall be available for granting by the City to other projects. 
iv.  Prior to the granting of any waivers, the findings outlined in Subsection (A)(4) shall be made. 
4.  Findings. Prior to the administrative approval by the Community Development Director or approval of a Minor Conditional Use Permit or Conditional Use Permit for a waiver of parking requirements, all of the following findings shall be made in addition to any general findings required for the appropriate permit: 
a.  No more than 180 parking space waivers have been granted in the Downtown Parking Study Area since the effective date of this amendment to the City's Zoning Ordinance; 
b.  There is currently adequate parking to support the change of use and/or development and provide adequate beach parking within the study area; 
c.  The City Council has approved an interim parking study for the Downtown Parking Study Area that shows the occupancy of the parking spaces in the study area is 90 percent or less during daylight hours, on summer weekends; 
d.  Public parking is available in close proximity to the project site; and 
e.  The project receiving waivers: 1) improves pedestrian access to and from alleys and streets within the Downtown Parking Study Area to the extent feasible and commensurate with the scale of the project; or 2) the project contains both nonresidential and residential uses and, therefore, promotes shared parking and pedestrian activity within the area. 
B.  Outside the Downtown Parking Study Area. Waivers of the parking requirements for the uses contained in the following table may be approved, subject to the approval of the indicated permits:

1.  The City intends that Nonconforming Structures and Uses be made to comply with the General Plan, any applicable Specific Plan, and zoning requirements to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  The City encourages improvements to Nonconforming Structures to increase their compatibility with surrounding properties, enhance the quality of development, and to have structures and land uses become conforming over time. 
(Ord. No. 1548, § 3(Exh. A, § 1), 3-6-2012)  
17.72.020 - Definitions. 
Definitions of terms used in this Chapter are located in Section 17.88.030 of this Title. 
(Ord. No. 1548, § 3(Exh. A, § 1), 3-6-2012)  
17.72.030 - Applicability. 
A.  Legal structures and uses. This Chapter applies only to Nonconforming Structures and Uses that have been "lawfully established." For purposes of this ordinance, Nonconforming Structures and Uses are "lawfully established" when structures are constructed and uses are established with the required and properly issued City approvals and/or permits and are consistent with regulations in effect when Nonconforming Structures or Uses were established. 
B.  Multiple Structures. When there are multiple structures on a site, this Chapter shall be applied as follows: 
1.  Nonconforming Structures repaired, altered, expanded, or replaced. This Chapter applies to Nonconforming Structures being repaired, altered, expanded, or replaced. 
2.  Conforming structures with substandard parking in detached garages or carports. This Chapter applies to conforming structures with required parking in a detached garage or carport where such parking does not comply with current parking requirements (e.g. number, size, location of spaces). See Figure 17.72.030A for explanation. 
Figure 17.72.030A  Detached garages and carports
 
C.  Exemptions. 
1.  State and Federal Law. Structures and land uses are exempt from this Chapter if State or Federal law requires structural or site plan alterations to be made that result in a structure becoming nonconforming [e.g. earthquake retrofitting safety standards; the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)]. For example, ADA can require a parking space to be widened to improve disabled access. To comply with this requirement, the number of parking spaces may need to be reduced or the parking lot redesigned. A reduction in the number parking spaces can make some structures and uses nonconforming in terms of parking requirements. 
2.  Structures. The following structures are exempt from this Chapter: 
a.  Structures that comply with all zoning requirements except landscape standards. 
b.  Single-family dwellings with a single car garage or carport constructed in residential zones prior to April 4, 1962. 
c.  In-the-bank garages located in residential zones which do not comply with front yard setback regulations. 
d.  National, state or locally designated historic structures may be exempted from this Chapter with the approval of a Cultural Heritage Permit per Table 17.16.100B. 
3.  Land uses. The following land uses are exempt from this chapter: 
a.  Multiple-family dwellings constructed in the Residential Low Density zoning district prior to April 4, 1962. 
b.  Service stations and vehicle service and repair-related facilities are exempt, provided the uses were lawfully established on or before February 4, 2014 (adoption date of General Plan), the uses have not been discontinued more than 365 consecutive calendar days, and the uses meet any of the criteria below: 
i.  The service station or vehicle service repair-related use is on property fronting El Camino Real, or fronting other arterial streets defined in Section 17.88.030, or 
ii.  The service station use is located on property in gateway areas (identified in the General Plan Urban Design Element) abutting Interstate-5 off-ramps and intersections. 
c.  Nonconforming uses associated with the historical significance of national, state or locally designated historic structures may be exempted from this Chapter with the approval of a Cultural Heritage Permit per Table 17.16.100.B. 
(Ord. No. 1548, § 3(Exh. A, § 1), 3-6-2012; Ord. No. 1652 , § 4, 5-15-2018)  
17.72.040 - General Requirements. 
A.  Proof of legal nonconforming status. 
1.  Property owner responsibility. The property owner shall provide evidence to the satisfaction of the City Planner to prove a Nonconforming Structure or Use was lawfully established. 
2.  City Planner determination. The City Planner determines whether a Nonconforming Structure or Use was lawfully established. 
B.  Code compliance of projects. Projects shall not make structures and uses more nonconforming. 
C.  Determining the safety of structures. The City Building Official determines whether a structure is safe for occupancy and use, according to building and safety regulations. 
D.  Appeal of administrative decisions. City Planner and Community Development Director decisions may be appealed per Section 17.12.140. 
(Ord. No. 1548, § 3(Exh. A, § 1), 3-6-2012)  
17.72.050 - Repair, Alteration, and Expansion of Nonconforming Structures. 
A.  Applicability of other review procedures. Section 17.16.050 (Site Plan Permits and Minor Site Plan Permits) or Section 17.16.100 (Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permits and Minor Architectural/Cultural Heritage Permits) may apply to projects that change Nonconforming Structures. These permits may be required to ensure site plans and architecture are reviewed through a discretionary process, where applicable. 
B.  Repairs. Nonconforming Structures may be Repaired according to City and State Codes, policies, and guidelines. 
C.  Interior alterations. The interior of Nonconforming Structures may be altered. Interior Additions are regulated by Subsection (I) (e.g. loft additions, crawlspace conversions). 
D.  Minor Exterior Alterations. Minor Exterior Alterations are permitted. Examples of Minor Exterior Alterations include but are not limited to: changing building materials, changing colors and finishes of materials; replacing wood/aluminum windows for vinyl windows; installing doors and windows in new openings; and modifying the color and type of guardrails. 
E.  Removal, replacement, and Major Alteration of Exterior Walls. The structural frame of a Nonconforming Structure's exterior walls may be removed, replaced, or altered as follows: 
1.  Nonconforming status may be continued. A Nonconforming Structure may continue to be nonconforming if a project: 
a.  Removes the structural frame in less than 50 percent of a structure's exterior walls. 
b.  Alters the structural frame in less than 50 percent of a structure's exterior walls. 
2.  50 percent or greater of exterior walls removed or altered. The following requirements apply when the structural frame is removed or altered in 50 percent or greater of a structure's exterior walls: 
a.  Nonconforming status shall be terminated. Nonconforming Structures shall be made to comply with zoning requirements. 
b.  Substandard parking in detached garages and carports. If detached garages or carports provide required parking for primary buildings (e.g. a house), and the parking does not meet requirements (e.g. size, location, number of spaces), the required parking spaces shall be modified to meet requirements. 
3.  Measuring exterior walls. 
a.  Multiple stories. Exterior walls are measured on all stories. 
b.  Units of measurement. Exterior walls are measured in lineal feet. 
c.  Calculation. Exterior wall improvements are regulated based on the percentage of exterior walls that are removed or altered. The percentage of improvements is calculated by dividing the total length of exterior walls that are removed or altered by the total length of a structure's exterior walls. This fraction is multiplied by 100. For example, when wood framing is removed from the exterior wall of a wood framed building, then that wall would be counted along the entire length of the area where the wood framing is removed. See Figure 17.72.050A for explanation. 
Figure 17.72.050A  Measuring Exterior Walls
 
4.  Exceptions. 
a.  Exception for safety, compatibility, or architectural improvements. Major alterations are not restricted, if the City Planner finds one or more of the following: 
i.  The Major Alterations improve the safety of structures. 
ii.  The Major Alterations improve the compatibility of the structure with the neighborhood. 
iii.  The Major Alterations improve the architecture's compatibility with the City of San Clemente Design Guidelines. 
b.  Single-family dwellings less than 1,400 square feet. Nonconforming single-family dwellings with less than 1,400 square feet of gross floor area are exempt from Subsection (2), with the approval of a Minor Exception Permit per Section 17.16.090. For approval, the Zoning Administrator must find: the proposed Minor Exception Permit is necessary for the general appearance of a project to be in character with the neighborhood. The general required findings shall also be met for the approval of a Minor Exception Permit. 
F.  Voiding of Minor Exception Permits. Minor Exception Permits allow structures to encroach into required setbacks and for required setbacks to be reduced per Section 17.16.090. Minor Exception Permits shall be voided if any of the following criteria applies: 
1.  A project removes the exterior walls that were allowed to encroach into required setbacks by a Minor Exception Permit. 
2.  A project removes 50 percent or greater of a structure's exterior walls. 
Figure 17.72.050 BVoiding of Minor Exception Permits
 
G.  Removal, replacement, and Major Alteration of Roofs. The structural frame of a Nonconforming Structure's roof may be removed, replaced, or altered as follows: 
1.  Roofs which comply with height requirements. Roofs of Nonconforming Structures may be partially or completely removed, replaced, or altered if their height complies with height requirements. 
2.  Over-height roofs. When a Nonconforming Structure has a roof that does not comply with height requirements, the roof's height shall be reduced to meet requirements, when 50 percent or greater of a roof's structural frame is removed or altered. 
a.  Exception for safety, compatibility, or architectural improvements. Major Alterations are not restricted, if the City Planner finds one or more of the following: 
i.  The Major Alterations improve the safety of structures. 
ii.  The Major Alterations improve the compatibility of the structure with the neighborhood. 
iii.  The Major Alterations improve the architecture's compatibility with the City of San Clemente Design Guidelines. 
3.  Measuring roofs. 
a.  Units of measurement. Roof area is measured in square feet of surface area. 
b.  Calculation. Roof improvements are regulated based on the percentage of roof area that is removed or altered. The percentage of improvements is calculated by dividing the square footage of roof area that is removed or altered by the total roof area of a structure. This fraction is multiplied by 100. See Figure 17.72.050C for explanation. 
Figure 17.72.050C  Measuring Roofs
 
H.  Nonconforming Accessory Structures. Nonconforming Accessory Structures may be removed, replaced, or enlarged as follows: 
1.  Nonconforming status may be continued. 
a.  Removal or replacement of structures. A Nonconforming Accessory Structure (e.g. patio covers, decks, stairways, walls) may continue to be nonconforming when less than 50 percent of the accessory structure is removed. 
b.  Expansion of structures. A Nonconforming Accessory Structure may be expanded and continue to be nonconforming. Expansions shall comply with zoning requirements. 
2.  Nonconforming status shall be terminated. 
a.  50 percent or greater of structures removed. A Nonconforming Accessory Structure shall lose its nonconforming status and be made to comply with zoning requirements if 50 percent or more of the accessory structure is removed. 
b.  Accessory structures attached to Nonconforming Buildings. A Nonconforming Accessory Structure shall be made to comply with zoning requirements if it is attached to a Nonconforming Building that must be made conforming by this Chapter. 
I.  Additions . Floor area may be added to Nonconforming Buildings as follows. Additions are based on square feet of gross floor area: 
1.  Review Procedures. Additions shall meet the requirements in Table 17.72.050A. 
Table 17.72.050A  Review Procedures for Additions 
Project 	Permit or Action Required 
Interior Addition (e.g. loft Addition, 
crawlspace conversion) or Addition 
below grade (e.g. basement). 	Projects may be eligible for a staff 
waiver of a Minor Architectural 
Permit/Minor Cultural Heritage Permit. 
Less than 50 percent expansion of 
gross floor area. 	Minor Architectural Permit/Minor 
Cultural Heritage Permit or staff waiver. 
50 percent or greater expansion of 
gross floor area. 	Buildings must be made to conform to 
requirements, except for single-family 
dwellings that are less than 1,400 
square feet. These buildings may be 
expanded to a maximum of 2,100 
square feet and remain nonconforming 
with the approval of a Minor 
Architectural Permit/Minor Cultural 
Heritage Permit. The Design Review 
Subcommittee shall review these 
projects prior to a Zoning Administrator 
hearing. 
 
2.  Additions that may continue nonconforming status. Nonconforming Buildings may continue to be nonconforming if they are expanded less than 50 percent, in compliance with zoning requirements. 
3.  50 percent or greater Addition. The following requirements apply when a Nonconforming Building is expanded by 50 percent or greater: 
a.  Nonconforming status shall be terminated. Nonconforming Buildings expanded by 50 percent or greater shall be made to conform to zoning requirements, except as follows: 
i.  Exception for single-family dwellings less than 1,400 square feet. Nonconforming single-family dwellings, smaller than 1,400 square feet, may continue to be nonconforming if they are expanded to a maximum of 2,100 square feet, provided that a Minor Architectural Permit or Minor Cultural Heritage Permit is approved. The Design Review Subcommittee shall review projects, prior to a Zoning Administrator hearing, to ensure additions are in character with a neighborhood and are consistent with the City's Design Guidelines. 
b.  Substandard parking in detached garages and carports. If detached garages or carports provide required parking for primary buildings (e.g. dwelling), and the parking does not meet requirements (e.g. size, location, number of spaces), the parking shall be modified to meet requirements, except as follows: 
i.  Exception for single-family dwellings less than 1,400 square feet. Nonconforming single-family dwellings, smaller than 1,400 square feet, may be expanded to a maximum of 2,100 square feet without modifying parking, provided that a Minor Exception Permit is approved. For approval, the Zoning Administrator must find: the proposed Minor Exception Permit is necessary for the general appearance of a project to be in character with the neighborhood. The general required findings shall also be met for the approval of a Minor Exception Permit per Section 17.16.090. 
4.  Measurement. 
a.  Units of measurement. Additions are measured in square feet of gross floor area ("gross floor area" is defined in Section 17.88.030). 
b.  Calculation. Additions are regulated by percentages. The percentage of an Addition ("or percent added") is calculated by dividing the square footage of an Addition by the square footage of a building before it is expanded. This fraction is then multiplied by 100. See Figure 17.72.050D for explanation. 
c.  Measurement of multiple projects. If a building has been expanded more than once, regulations are applied based on the total amount of floor area that is added to a building on or after March 21, 1996. For example, if a building is expanded by 10 percent in 1997 and expanded another 20 percent in 1999, then the building has been expanded a total of 30 percent since March 21, 1996.

(Ord. No. 1548, § 3(Exh. A, § 1), 3-6-2012; Ord. No. 1561, § 3(Exh. A, §§ 27, 28), 11-27-2012; Ord. No. 1594, § 3(Exh. A, § 41), 5-5-2015)  
17.72.060 - Nonconforming Use Restrictions. 
A.  Change of tenancy or ownership. Change of management, ownership, or tenancy of a Nonconforming Use shall not affect its nonconforming status provided the use is not expanded, as determined by the City Planner. 
B.  Discontinued uses. 
1.  Nonconforming Uses. Nonconforming Uses discontinued for more than one-year (365 consecutive calendar days) shall be rebuttably presumed to have been abandoned. Abandoned uses shall be converted to uses that meet zoning requirements. 
2.  Nonconforming alcoholic beverage sales. Nonconforming alcoholic beverage sales shall be terminated if the City Planner determines any of the following criteria applies: 
a.  The sale of alcoholic beverages is discontinued for more than 90 consecutive calendar days. 
b.  The sale of alcoholic beverages is discontinued for more than 180 consecutive calendar days to complete repairs, alterations, or to replace structural damage, according to City approved plans and permits. 
c.  The sale of alcoholic beverages is discontinued for any period of time as a result of: a duly conducted abatement proceeding and suspension, a closure ordered by the City of San Clemente or the State of California Alcohol Beverage Control Board, or the order of any court. 
3.  Burden to prove a Nonconforming Use may continue. 
a.  Property owner responsibility. Property owners, tenants, or their representatives shall have the burden to prove how many consecutive days a use has been discontinued and/or prove a use has not been abandoned. 
b.  City Planner determination. The City Planner determines how much time has passed since a Nonconforming Use was discontinued. 
C.  Changes of use. 
1.  Change to a conforming use. Once converted to a conforming use, a Nonconforming Use shall be not be reestablished. 
2.  Change of use when the required number of parking spaces is not provided. A non conforming use may be changed to another use allowed by zoning regulations. When the required number of parking spaces is not provided, one of the following criteria must be met: 
a.  The proposed use is required to provide the same number or fewer parking spaces as the existing use. 
b.  The proposed use is required to provide more parking spaces than the existing use and parking is being added to meet the required increase. For example, if the existing use requires four spaces and the new use requires eight, four spaces must be added. 
c.  Parking spaces will be provided to fully comply with zoning regulations. 
3.  Change from prohibited use to a different prohibited use. A Conditional Use Permit is required to replace a prohibited land use with another prohibited land use. For approval, the following findings shall be met in addition to the generally required findings for the approval of Conditional Use Permits per Section 17.16.060. 
a.  The proposed use has less impacts upon the neighborhood than the use(s) being replaced, including, but not limited to, impacts upon parking, traffic, neighborhood aesthetics, noise levels, and residential density. 
b.  The proposed Nonconforming Use more closely meets the intent of the Zoning Ordinance and the zone in which the Nonconforming Use is located than the use(s) being replaced. 
c.  The proposed use is less detrimental to the public welfare and to surrounding properties than the use(s) being replaced. 
D.  Expansion of Nonconforming Uses. 
1.  Expansion of permitted uses with nonconforming parking. A land use may be expanded if the use is permitted but does not have the required number of parking spaces. To expand, off-street parking spaces shall be added that are equal to or are greater than the number of spaces required for the addition. For example, if two parking spaces are required to add 400 square feet of medical office space, then two parking spaces or more shall be added. 
2.  Expansion of prohibited uses. A Nonconforming Use shall not be expanded if the use is prohibited. An expansion includes but is not limited to changes that: 
a.  Construct a new structure or increase the gross square footage of an existing structure to increase the floor space that is occupied by a Nonconforming Use. 
b.  Install new or expand existing equipment that increases the capacity, function, or output of a Nonconforming Use. 
c.  Increase the operating hours of a Nonconforming Use. 
d.  Increase the occupancy of a structure. 
e.  Increase the parking, noise, traffic, dust, water quality, or other adverse impacts of a Nonconforming Use. 
E.  Nonconforming mobilehome and mobilehome park uses . Nonconforming mobilehomes may be replaced, renovated, remodeled, expanded or repaired. New mobilehome accessory structures and utility improvements are permitted. Mobilehome park common areas, roadways, and utility improvements may also be added, repaired, renovated, remodeled, expanded or replaced. All mobilehome and mobilehome park improvements shall comply with California Code of Regulations, Title 25, Division 1, Chapter 2. Mobilehome Parks and Installations. 
F.  Nonconforming Group Counseling Uses . 
1.  Any group-counseling use that is legal nonconforming as of March 1, 2016, is subject to an amortization period of three years. 
2.  The owner or operator of a legal nonconforming group-counseling use may apply for an extension of the amortization period by making a written request to the Community Development Director. Such request shall be made before the amortization period ends unless the Community Development Director determines that good cause is shown for late submission of the request. 
3.  Upon the conclusion of the amortization period, any legally established nonconforming use shall cease all business operations and all signs, advertising, and displays relating to said business shall be removed within 30 days. 
G.  Nonconforming Residential Uses . 
1.  STLUs and STARs. 
a.  Generally. Any residential use that was legally established and legally operating as of February 2, 2016 (including any legitimate legal and appropriately licensed home occupation and any other legitimate and legal incidental and accessory commercial use) but that is categorized by the provisions of this title as a Short-term Lodging Unit ("STLU") or Short-term Apartment Rental ("STAR") and does not conform to the development standards of Subsections 17.28.292.E. and F. is subject to an amortization period of two years, or until the sale or transfer of the property whichever occurs first, as long as that STLU or STAR is operated according to the operational standards of Subsections 17.28.292.C and D. with a valid STLU operating license under Chapter 3.24 and in accordance with other local, state, and federal law. 
b.  Notwithstanding subsection G.1.a. above, the owner of an STLU outside of the RVL and RL zones may, if the owner is in good standing, extend the two-year amortization period to ten years by submitting a complete, written application to extend the amortization period on a form provided by the Director of Community Development within 30 days after -the Director makes extension application forms available to the public. "In good standing" here means: current on remittance of STLU TOT to the City and with no violation of the City's municipal code, including the TOT ordinance, that was not cured within 30 days of the notice of violation. The Director's decision on amortization-extension applications is ministerial. 
c.  Any amortization extension granted under subsection G.1.b above constitutes a use permit that is specific and personal to the STLU owner and does not run with the land, and it terminates upon any sale or transfer of the STLU property as defined in subsection G.3 below. 
2.  Boarding Houses. Any residential use that was legally established and legally operating as of May 3, 2016, (including any legitimate legal and appropriately licensed home occupation and any other legitimate and legal incidental and accessory commercial use) but that is categorized by the provisions of this Title as a boarding house is subject to an amortization period of two years or until the sale or transfer of the property whichever occurs first, as long as that boarding house is operated in accordance with other local, state, and federal law. 
3.  Change of Ownership. A change of ownership for purposes of Subsections 17.72.060G.1. and 2. above includes, but is not limited to, the sale of at least 50 percent of the shares in any type of corporation, or a change in any of the principal officers in a corporation as determined by the City Manager or his or her designee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the permittee is a partnership and one or more of the partners withdraws, one or more of the remaining partners may acquire by purchase or otherwise the interest of the partner or partners who withdrew without effecting a change in ownership, and in such case the permittee is deemed to be the surviving partner(s). 
4.  Amortization Extension. 
a.  Eligibility. The owner of (i) a legal nonconforming STLU or STAR in an RVL or RL zone or (ii) a legal nonconforming boarding house in any residential zone may apply for an extension of the amortization period by making a written request to the Community Development Director. (Legal nonconforming STLUs and STARs in other residential zones are subject to a different amortization process under subsection G.1.b. 
b.  Timing. Such request shall be made before the amortization period ends unless the Community Development Director determines that good cause is shown for late submission of the request. 
c.  Hearing Officer. A timely request for an extension of the amortization period shall be heard by a neutral third-party hearing officer within 30 days of receipt of the request. The party requesting the extension shall pay the costs of the hearing, including the cost of the hearing officer, and shall deposit funds sufficient to cover those costs when the written request for extension is submitted to the City. 
d.  Criteria. A request for an extension of the amortization period shall only be issued if the property owner demonstrates to the hearing officer's satisfaction that the specified amortization period is unreasonably short and that an extension is in fact necessary to avoid a constitutional taking. Factors may include, but are not limited to, the extent of the particular owner's investment that is unique to the non-conforming use and does not serve any conforming use of the property, the extent of the owner's investment that will not be recovered on sale of the property the owner's investment-backed expectations in light of current and pending regulation at the time that the investment was made, replacement cost of improvements that might have been made that only serve the nonconforming use, and the length of time that the owner has had the benefit of the investment before the use became nonconforming. 
e.  Burden. The burden is on the owner to demonstrate that the general two-year period is unreasonable in the owner's particular case. 
5.  The owner or operator of a legal nonconforming STLU or STAR may apply for a waiver of certain operating standards during the amortization period by making a written request to the Community Development Director, accompanied by evidence demonstrating that enforcement of the standard or standards creates an exceptional hardship. The operating standard subject to possible waiver is limited to that found in Subsection 17.28.292C.11, Occupancy and Parking. 
6.  Upon the conclusion of the amortization period, any legally established nonconforming STLU, STAR, or boarding house shall cease all business and lodging operations. This does not prevent the dwelling unit from being used as a long-term residential rental. 
7.  All STLUs and STARs, but not boarding houses, that are nonconforming at the end of the amortization period for no reason other than they do not meet the requirements specified in Subsections 17.28.292E.2, Zone Density, or F., STAR Minimum Distancing, of this Title, may remain a nonconforming use in compliance with the general standards for nonconforming uses specified in Subsections B through D of this section, but any change of ownership, as described in Subsection G.3. of this section, shall immediately require that the use of the property as a STLU or STAR be terminated. 
(Ord. No. 1548, § 3(Exh. A, § 1), 3-6-2012; Ord. No. 1561, § 3(Exh. A, § 29), 11-27-2012; Ord. No. 1591, § 3, 1-6-2015; Ord. No. 1616, § 12, 2-2-2016; Ord. No. 1622, § 12, 5-17-2016; Ord. No. 1654 , §§ 16, 17, 5-15-2018)  
17.72.070 - Deferred Repairs and Accident Damage of Nonconforming Structures and Uses. 
A.  Deferred Repairs. Structures, and the uses that occupy them, shall be made to comply with zoning requirements if structures are damaged by deferred maintenance or repairs and the City Planner finds either of the following: 
1.  The damaged structure is a public nuisance and/or is unsafe for occupancy due to deferred repairs. 
2.  The cost of replacing structural damage is equal to or greater than the damaged structure's replacement cost. 
B.  Accident Damage. Structures, and the uses that occupy them, may be replaced when structures are damaged by an accident, as follows: 
1.  Exemption of multi-family dwellings. Multi-family dwellings are exempted from requirements in this Subsection, provided that a building permit is approved within three years (1,095 consecutive days), from the date of an accident that causes damage. Per California Government Code Section 65852.25, multi-family dwellings are "any structure designed for human habitation that is divided into two or more independent living quarters." 
2.  Nonconforming single-family dwellings located in residential zones. Nonconforming single-family dwellings may be replaced if dwellings are located in residential zoning districts. To replace a dwelling, a building permit shall be approved within three years (1,095 consecutive days) from the date of an accident that causes damage. 
3.  Nonconforming Structures located in non-residential zones. Nonconforming Structures may be replaced as follows when they are located in non-residential zones: 
a.  Structures damaged less than 50 percent of a structure's replacement cost. Nonconforming structures may be replaced if the cost to replace or repair accident damage is less than 50 percent than the structure's replacement cost. To replace a structure, a building permit shall be approved within three years (1,095 consecutive days) from the date of an accident that causes damage. 
b.  Structures damaged by 50 percent or greater of a structure's replacement cost. A Conditional Use Permit is required to replace Nonconforming Structures if the cost to replace or repair accident damage is 50 percent or greater than the structure's replacement cost, immediately before the damage occurred. To replace a structure, a Conditional Use Permit application shall be submitted within two years (730 consecutive days) from the date of an accident that causes damage. For permit approval, the following findings shall be made and the general required findings for Conditional Use Permits: 
i.  The proposed structure has less impacts upon the neighborhood than the structure(s) being replaced, including, but not limited to, impacts upon parking, traffic, neighborhood aesthetics, noise levels, and residential density. 
ii.  The proposed Nonconforming Structure more closely meets the intent and development standards of the Zoning Ordinance and the zone in which the Nonconforming structure is located than the structure(s) being replaced. 
iii.  The proposed structure is less detrimental to the public welfare and to surrounding properties than the structure(s) being replaced. 
4.  Structures occupied by a Nonconforming Use. A Nonconforming Use shall be terminated when a use occupies a structure that is damaged by an accident and the cost to replace or repair the accident damage is 50 percent or greater than the structure's replacement cost, immediately before the damage occurred. The structure shall be occupied by a use that complies with zoning requirements. 
5.  Time extensions. The Community Development Director may grant one or more 90-day time extensions for the issuance of building permits, if he/she determines permits have been pursued in good faith and there has been a justifiable cause for the delays. 
6.  Progress of construction. Construction work shall be completed within required time frames per Title 15 of the Municipal Code. 
7.  Estimating replacement cost. 
a.  Property owner responsibility. Property owners or their representative shall submit a detailed written analysis of a structure's replacement cost. 
b.  Professional analysis. A qualified and experienced construction cost estimator shall estimate the cost to replace structures and other applicable site improvements, according to existing construction cost estimating indices, to the approval of the City Planner.

CHAPTER 17.76 - TRIP REDUCTION AND TRAVEL DEMAND MANAGEMENT 
 
17.76.010 - Purpose and intent. 
This chapter is intended to meet the requirements of AB 1791, which requires development of a trip reduction and travel demand element to the CMP which requires adoption and implementation of Trip Reduction and Travel Demand Ordinance. 
New commercial, industrial and mixed-use development projects, including employment centers of 100 persons or more, may adversely impact existing transportation and parking facilities, resulting in increased motor vehicle emissions, deteriorating levels of service, and possibly the need for significant additional capital expenditures to augment and improve the existing transportation system. In order to more efficiently utilize the existing and planned transportation system and to reduce vehicle emissions, it is the policy of the City to: 
A.  Reduce the number of peak-period vehicle trips generated in association with the approval of development projects; 
B.  Promote and encourage the use of alternative transportation modes such as ridesharing, carpools, vanpools, public bus and rail transit, bicycles and walking, as well as those facilities that support such modes; 
C.  Reduce vehicle trips, traffic congestion and public expenditures for transportation system improvements and improve air quality through the utilization of existing local mechanisms and procedures for project review and permit processing; 
D.  Promote coordinated implementation of strategies on a County-wide basis to reduce transportation demand; and 
E.  Achieve the most efficient use of local resources through coordinated and consistent regional and/or local TDM programs. 
(Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.76.020 - Applicability. 
A.  The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development projects estimated to employ a total of 100 or more persons as determined by the methodology in Subsection (B)(2) of this section. 
B.  For purposes of determining whether a development project will employ 100 or more persons and thus be subject to this section, the City shall determine the estimated employment of any development project by the following mechanism which yields the highest potential for employment: 
1.  Employment projections for the development project developed by the project applicant, subject to approval by the City; or 
2.  Employment projections developed for the development project by the City using the following employee generation factors by type of use: 
Land Use Category 	Gross Sq. Ft./Employee 
Commercial 	
Regional 	500 
Community 	500 
Neighborhood 	500 
Office/professional 	250 
Industrial 	525 
Hotel 	0.8-1.2/room

CHAPTER 17.84 - SIGN REGULATIONS 
 
17.84.010 - Administration. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish regulations for signs. The City recognizes the need for signs to identify businesses and properties within the community. The City also recognizes that signs are an important design element of the physical environment which serve to express the individuality of the business as well as the character of the community. Sign regulations which implement the City's goals and objectives are necessary. These sign regulations will help ensure both individual expression and an attractive community character. 
The City's goals are to protect and enhance the City's historical, nonhistorical and residential character, as well as to enhance the City's economic base. These goals are accomplished through approving appropriately designed signs, controlling the size, location and maintenance of the signs, eliminating visually conflicting and competing sign displays and avoiding potential traffic and pedestrian safety hazards. 
The City has determined these goals are best served by following the specific objectives set forth below. It is anticipated that these objectives and associated regulations will contribute to the economic viability of the City and its overall attractiveness to the residents, visitors and businesses. The City thereby establishes the following objectives: 
1.  To implement sign design standards that are consistent with the City's General Plan; 
2.  To present a set of reasonable, content-neutral, sign standards and procedures that enable fair and consistent enforcement; 
3.  To facilitate the improvement and protection of the environment by prohibiting misuse of certain signs and ensuring information is presented safely and effectively; 
4.  To promote a high quality business environment by assuring that signs are complementary to the City's goals for historic preservation and quality urban design; 
5.  To ensure that signs are carefully designed, aesthetically pleasing, appropriately maintained, and professional in appearance; 
6.  To invite artistry and innovation in signs while maintaining and improving the appearance of buildings and neighborhoods in which they are placed; 
7.  To reduce possible traffic and safety hazards through reduced sign clutter, the elimination of unauthorized signs in the public right-of-way, and minimizing visual competition among signs; 
8.  To minimize the visual and lighting impacts of business signs on adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
B.  Clarification of Ambiguities/Interpretations. If ambiguity arises within the meaning and intent of this chapter, or if ambiguity exists with respect to any standards, requirements or enforcement as set forth herein, the ambiguity shall be resolved in accordance with Section 17.04.040, Interpretations, of this title.

(Ord. 1245 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1172 § 3 (part), 1996)  
17.84.020 - General Regulations. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of these general regulations is to define the parameters for design, size, height and location of signs. The requirements related to the number, design type and size of signs outlined in this chapter are intended to be maximum standards which do not necessarily ensure compatibility with building architecture, the neighborhood and the community appearance. Consideration shall be given to the sign's relationship to the overall appearance of the subject property and surrounding area. 
B.  General Design Standards. 
1.  Construction of Signs. 
a.  Signs shall be constructed as to not obstruct line of sight for pedestrians, bicyclists or vehicular drivers. 
b.  All permanent sign faces shall be constructed of permanent materials including, but not limited to, painted and/or sandblasted wood, ceramic tile, applied letters, carved wood, metal, plastic or other compatible, durable and waterproof material. No material more combustible than treated wood shall be used in the construction of any permanent sign. 
c.  All signs shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable Uniform Building Code and National Electrical Code provisions. 
d.  Sign support hardware shall be of a compatible material and design with the sign it supports and shall compliment the architecture and design of building to which it is affixed. Sign supports of a permanent sign shall be reviewed as part of the sign application. 
e.  Signs shall be designed and oriented to minimize light or glare upon adjacent residential properties and public rights-of-way. 
f.  Sign design, scale, color and materials shall be selected that are compatible in style with the building it serves. 
2.  Lighting of Signs. 
a.  Electrical lines from buildings to signs shall be concealed from public view. Exposed raceways are prohibited. 
b.  Light fixtures in planted areas or within support structures shall be screened. 
c.  All external lighting shall be directed away from any adjacent residential uses and public rights-of-way. 
d.  Internally lighted signs shall be a maximum of 200,000 lumens. Neon lighting may be used as an alternative lighting source. 
3.  Landscaping. 
a.  Landscaped planters shall be required to be installed at the base of all permanent freestanding signs. 
b.  The area of the landscaped planter shall be at least equal in size to the area of two sign faces for pole signs and one sign face for monument signs. 
c.  All landscaped planters shall be irrigated and landscaped with living plant material. Drought tolerant, low maintenance plants shall be utilized wherever possible. 
d.  The type of irrigation required will be dependent on the type of landscaping proposed. Plants requiring extensive watering shall require automatic irrigation systems. 
e.  All landscaped planter areas and plant materials shall be maintained in a neat and healthy manner and shall be kept free of all debris and trash. 
C.  Design of signs within an Architectural Overlay District. The Architectural Overlay District sign standards are intended to maintain or enhance the character of the area. Public and private buildings have been constructed and maintained in the traditional Spanish Colonial Revival style of architecture. The district emphasizes a pedestrian orientation giving the area a distinct identity. The design, scale, color and materials of signs should be compatible with both the Spanish Colonial Revival style of architecture and the unique character of the district in which the sign is to be located. Therefore, signs within the Architectural Overlay District shall comply with the following additional standards: 
1.  All signs shall be hand-crafted in appearance. 
2.  Acceptable sign materials may include, but are not limited to, sandblasted and carved wood, hand-painted, glazed tile, pinned metal or wood letters, or other similar materials. All signs shall be constructed of and mounted and supported with materials compatible with the Spanish architectural theme including, but not limited to, stained wood supports and accents, trowelled stucco applications, painted terra cotta tiles, ornamental wrought iron, canvas awnings or other similar materials. 
3.  Signs may be illuminated as follows: 
a.  External lighting (e.g. spot lighting, goose neck lights). 
b.  Back lighting. 
c.  Neon lighting with the approval of a Discretionary Sign Permit per Section 17.16.250. 
Figure 17.84.020A 
 
D.  Sign Area Allowed. 
1.  Maximum Sign Area Limitations for a Site. 
a.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this subsection is to regulate the maximum sign area allowed for a site. The intent of these regulations is to make the total sign area allowed on a site proportionate to the length of business frontage. The intent is also to limit the total sign area along any one boundary of a site. Within this subsection, service stations are treated differently than other businesses, in terms of the total sign area permitted, because of the typically limited scale of buildings on a service station site. 
b.  Maximum Sign Area Allowed Per a Site. 
The maximum sign area allowed for a site shall be as follows: 
i.  For nonresidential buildings, one square foot of sign allowed for each lineal foot of all business façade; 
ii.  For service stations, one square foot of sign area allowed for each lineal foot of street frontage. 
Figure 17.84.020B 
 
c.  Maximum Sign Area Oriented Toward Any One Property Line of a Site, Common Parking Area, Pedestrian Area, Driveway or Alley. 
The maximum sign area oriented toward any one property line of a site or common parking area, pedestrian space, or driveway shall be limited as follows: 
i.  For nonresidential buildings, one square foot of sign allowed for each lineal foot of adjacent building elevation; 
ii.  For service stations, one square foot of sign area allowed for each lineal foot of adjacent street frontage; 
iii.  For signs oriented toward alleys, a maximum of one six square foot nonilluminated sign per business shall be permitted. 
Figure 17.84.020C 
 
d.  Computation of Sign Area. 
i.  Sign Area of Individual Single-Faced Signs. The area of a sign shall be computed based on the entire area within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of the sign, including all words, symbols, emblems, representations or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the sign or display. The area of a sign shall also include all nonstructural perimeter trim, but excludes the structures or uprights on which the sign is supported, unless such supports or uprights are designed in a manner so as to form an integral background of the sign. 
ii.  Sign Area of Window Signs. The area of a window sign shall be the area composed of words, letters, symbols or other display. For maximum window sign area allowed, refer to sign matrix, Section 17.84.030(C) of this chapter. 
iii.  Sign Area of Multifaced Signs. Except for monument signs, the sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces.

3.  Exemptions. Subsequent signs installed that are part of a previously approved Master Sign Program and are consistent with the provisions of that Master Sign Program shall require an Administrative Sign Permit but shall be considered exempt from Discretionary Sign Permit Review. 
4.  Application. Applications for a Master Sign Program shall be made in writing on the Discretionary Sign Permit application form provided by the Planning Division and submitted to the Planning Division along with the required fees. 
H.  Removal of Signs. The City shall require removal of any sign, at the owners' expense and without compensation, that meets any of the following criteria. 
1.  Any sign erected without first complying with all ordinances and regulations in effect at the time of its construction, erection or use; 
2.  Any sign which was lawfully erected, but whose use has ceased, or the structure upon which the sign has been abandoned by its owner, for a period of not less than 90 days; 
3.  Any sign which has been more that 50 percent destroyed, and the destruction is other than facial copy replacement, and the sign cannot be repaired within 30 days of the date of its destruction; 
4.  Any sign whose owner seeks relocation thereof and relocates the sign; 
5.  Any sign that is temporary; 
6.  Any sign for which there has been an agreement between the sign owner and the City, for its removal as of any given date; 
7.  Any sign whose owner, outside a change of copy, requests permission to remodel and remodels that sign, or expand or enlarge the building or land use upon which the sign is located, and the sign is affected by the construction, enlargement or remodeling, or the cost of construction, enlargement or remodeling of the sign exceeds 50 percent of the cost of the reconstruction of the building; 
8.  Any sign which is or may become a danger to the public or is unsafe; 
9.  Any sign which constitutes a traffic hazard not created by a relocation of streets or by acts of the City or County. 
10.  Any nonconforming sign where there has been a change of use on the subject site.
