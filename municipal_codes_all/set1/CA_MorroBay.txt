PREFACE 
The Morro Bay, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1974, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 7, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification. 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 619, passed January 22, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, can be added between 2.04, and Chapter 2.08. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

(Ord. No. 573, 10-11-11)  
2.06.030 - Council vacancy reform. 
A.  Policy of Full Term Service. Election to public office in the city of Morro Bay creates a covenant to serve to the best of one's ability the full term of that office before seeking alternate public office. Without the enactment of the ordinance codified in this section when a councilmember in the middle of their term moves to an alternate office it also denies the citizens of Morro Bay the right to vote for the person who will fill the vacancy created by that move. If a councilmember wishes to run for alternate office before his or her term has expired he or she should resign from their seat so that the voters may elect their replacement in an orderly manner. 
B.  How Vacancies Filled. The city council shall immediately call a special election to fill any vacant seat on the council, including the mayor's seat. The special election shall be held on the next established election date, as specified in California Elections Code, which is not less than one hundred fourteen days from the call of the special election. The city council may appoint an elector who is a registered voter in the city of Morro Bay to fill such vacancy prior to the special election. The appointee shall hold office only until the date of said special election. 
1.  Mailed Ballots. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B, if the date of the special election otherwise required under subsection B would not be a consolidated election, the city council may designate the special election to be held by mailed ballot under the provisions of California Elections Code Section 4004 at the next available mailed ballot election date which is not less than one hundred fourteen days from the call of the special election. 
C.  Limitation of Councilmember Who Runs for Mayor Before Completing Regular Term. A sitting councilmember is disqualified from nomination for election to the office of mayor in the next election if the remainder of their council term after the next election cannot be filled by a vote of the electors on or prior to that election date. 
D.  Cost Reimbursement. 
1.  If the special election to fill a council vacancy occurs prior to the next general municipal election and the former councilmember whose seat was vacated causing that special election accepts nomination to run for the office of council or mayor in the next general municipal election, that former councilmember shall reimburse the city for city costs incurred as a result of said special election if the term of service for the seat previously vacated would have otherwise overlapped the term being sought. 
2.  Any mayor whose election to that office also created the premature vacancy of their council seat shall reimburse the city for city costs incurred in any future special election which must later be called to fill their prematurely vacated seat. As used in this subsection the term "future special election" means a special election that does not occur at the same time or prior to their election to the office of mayor. 
E.  Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this section should be held invalid the remaining provision or provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

A.  Notice Inviting Bids. Notices inviting bids shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased, shall state where bid blanks and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids. 
1.  Published Notice. Notices inviting bids shall set a date for the opening of bids. The first publication or posting of the notice shall be at least ten days before the date of opening of the bids. Notices shall be published at least twice, not less than five days apart, in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in the city, or if there is none, it shall be posted in at least three public places in the city that have been designated by ordinance as the places for posting public notices. 
2.  Bidders' List. The purchasing agent shall also solicit sealed bids from all responsible prospective suppliers whose names are on the bidders' list or who have made written request that their names be added thereto. 
3.  Bulletin Board. The purchasing agent shall also advertise pending purchases by a notice posted on a public bulletin board in the city hall. 
B.  Bidder's Security. When deemed necessary by the purchasing agent, bidder's security may be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids. 
1.  Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid security; provided, however, that a successful bidder shall forfeit his bid security upon his refusal or failure to execute the contract within ten days after the notice of award of contract has been mailed, unless in the latter event the city is solely responsible for the delay in executing the contract. The city council may, on refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, award it to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the city council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder's security shall be applied by the city to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. If the city council rejects all bids presented and readvertises, the amount of the lowest bidder's security may be used to offset the cost of receiving new bids (and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder). 
C.  Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the purchasing agent and shall be identified as "bids" on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. A tabulation of all bids received shall be opened for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than thirty calendar days after the bid opening. 
D.  Rejection of Bids. In its discretion, the city council may reject any and all bids presented and readvertise for bids pursuant to the procedure hereinabove prescribed. 
E.  Award of Contracts. Except as otherwise provided in this section, contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Purchasing preferences may be provided in the following areas. 
1.  Recycled Goods. Fitness and quality being equal, the purchasing agent shall purchase recycled goods, paper and paper products. The purchasing agent may give preference to the suppliers of recycled goods, paper or paper products if the bids of these suppliers do not exceed by more than ten percent the lowest bid or price quoted by suppliers offering unrecycled goods, paper or paper products. 
For the purpose of this section: 
a.  "Recycled product" means all materials, goods, and supplies, no less than fifty percent of the total weight of which consists of secondary and postconsumer waste with not less than ten percent of its total weight consisting of postconsumer waste. A recycled product shall include any product which could have been disposed of as solid waste having completed its life cycle as a consumer item, but otherwise is refurbished for reuse without substantial alteration of its form. 
b.  "Postconsumer waste" means a finished material which would have been disposed of as a solid waste, having completed its life cycle as a consumer item, and does not include manufacturing wastes. 
c.  "Secondary waste" means fragments of finished products or finished products of manufacturing process, which has converted a resource into a commodity of real economic value, and includes postconsumer waste but does not include excess virgin resources of the manufacturing process. 
2.  Local Vendors. Fitness and quality being equal, the purchasing agent shall purchase supplies and equipment locally. The purchasing agent may give preference to the local vendors if the bids of these vendors do not exceed by more than five percent the lowest bid or price quoted by other vendors. To qualify as a local vendor the business must meet both of the following requirements. 
a.  The business must have a current business license with the city, and 
b.  The business must report and pay sales tax to the state of California, that identifies the point of sale for taxable transactions as a location within the city limits. This provides for allocation of sales tax moneys to the city pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 72 et seq. 
F.  Tie Bids. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay or readvertising for bids, the city council may in its discretion accept the one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by and after negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening. 
G.  Performance Bonds. The city council shall have authority to require a performance bond before entering a contract in such amount as it shall find reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the city. If the city council requires a performance bond, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids. 
H.  The city council may contract directly without public bid with any specially trained and experienced person, firm or corporation for special services and advice in financial, economic, accounting, engineering, legal or administrative matters and pay such compensation as it deems proper. 
I.  The city council shall also have the right to and may in its discretion contract directly without public bid under lease-purchase agreements for leases of equipment; provided however, the city shall not lease equipment without three written quotations and prior council approval. 
J.  In its discretion, the city council may reject all bids presented and readvertise or proceed without further public bidding as provided in this chapter. If two or more bids are the same and the lowest, the city council may accept the one it chooses. If no bids are received, or in the event that the city council elects to reject all bids, it may elect to either proceed without public bidding or may resubmit the matter for further public bidding. 
K.  After considering and rejecting bids twice, the city council may pass a resolution authorizing the city administrator or his designee to negotiate for the purchase of materials, supplies or services. Upon adoption of the resolution, he or she may proceed without further complying with this chapter. 
(Ord. 391, 1991; Ord. 371 §§ 1, 2, 1990; Ord. 335, 1988; Ord. 184, 1980; Ord. 164 § 10, 1979) 
(Ord. No. 594, § 3, 8-25-15)  
3.08.105 - Local business preference program. 
A.  Findings. 
1.  The city annually spends significant amounts on purchasing supplies, materials, and equipment, and contractual and professional services. The dollars used in making these purchases are derived in large measure from taxes and fees from local businesses and the city council has determined that funds generated in the community should, to the extent possible, be placed back into the local economy. Therefore, the city council has determined that it is in the best interest of the city to give a preference to local businesses in making such purchases whenever the application of such a preference is reasonable in light of the dollar-value received in relation to such expenditure. 
2.  Many of these local business establishments have been doing business in Morro Bay for many years. The city council finds that the city should promote and stimulate local businesses by requiring that purchases of supplies, materials, equipment, and contractual services be acquired from local businesses. 
3.  The city council further finds that this action is necessary to grow the local economy and preserve the local businesses that have diligently served Morro Bay for many years. 
4.  Strategies that encourage people to buy locally are an important component of economic sustainability. Retaining local dollars within a community reduces economic export and increases the financial productivity of taxpayer dollars and increases the consumption of local goods and services while fostering a sustainable community. In working towards a sustainable economy, the city council recognizes that sustainable procurement policies are an important early step on the Morro Bay path to a sustainable community. Leveraging the purchasing power of the city to buy local products and services instead of products and services from outside Morro Bay strengthens the local economic activity and employment as well as sets an example that helps foster and maintain a vital economic community for future generations. 
B.  Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the city to promote employment and business opportunities for local residents and firms on all contracts and give preference to local residents, workers, businesses, contractors, and consultants to the extent consistent with the law and interests of the public. 
C.  Local Preference in Purchasing. In the bidding of, or letting for procurement of, supplies, materials, and equipment, as provided in this chapter, the city council or the purchasing agent shall give a preference to local businesses in making such purchase or awarding such contract in an amount not to exceed five percent of the local business' total bid price. 
D.  Local Preference in Services. In awarding contracts for services, including consultant services, preference to local businesses shall be given whenever practicable pursuant to this chapter consistent with the statement of policy in subsection (A)(2) above. The contractor or consultant will also, to the extent legally possible, solicit applications for employment and proposals for subcontractors and subconsultants for work associated with the proposed contract from local residents and firms as opportunities occur and hire qualified local residents and firms whenever feasible. 
E.  Local Preference in Public Works Contracts (Sub-Contracting). The prime contractor shall use good faith efforts to sub-contract the supply of materials and equipment to local business enterprises and to sub-contract services to businesses whose work force resides within Morro Bay. The prime contractor shall submit evidence of such good faith efforts at the time of submission of bids. Good faith efforts may be evaluated by placing advertisements inviting proposals in local newspapers, sending request for proposals to local sub-contractors, or by demonstrating that no local sub-contractors are qualified to perform the work or supply the materials or equipment. Any notice inviting bids which may require the use of sub-contractors shall include notification of this subsection. The city council or purchasing agent may reject as non-responsive the bid of any contractor proposing to use sub-contractors that fail to comply with the requirements of this subsection. 
F.  Exceptions to Local Business Preference Policy. The preference set forth in this section shall not apply to the following purchases or contracts: 
1.  Goods or services provided under a cooperative purchasing agreement. 
2.  Purchases or contracts which are funded in whole or in part by a governmental entity and the laws, regulations, or policies governing such funding prohibit application of that preference. 
3.  Purchases made or contracts let under emergency or noncompetitive situations. 
4.  Application of the local business preference to a particular purchase, contract, or category of contracts for which the city council is the awarding authority may be waived at the city council's discretion. 
G.  Quality and Fitness. The preferences established in this section shall in no way be construed to inhibit, limit or restrict the right and obligation of the city council and the purchasing agent to compare quality and fitness for use of supplies, materials, equipment, and services proposed for purchase and to compare the qualifications, character, responsibility, and fitness of all persons, firms, or corporations submitting bids or proposals. In addition, the preferences established in this section shall in no way be construed to prohibit the right of the city council or the purchasing agent from giving any other preference permitted by law or this chapter. 
H.  Verification of Local Business Preference Eligibility. Any vendor or consultant claiming to be a local business shall so certify in the bid in writing. "Local business" means a vendor or contractor who has paid its local business tax to the city of Morro Bay at least six months prior to bid or proposal opening date; does business in the Morro Bay community by providing goods, services, or construction; and maintains a physical business address located within five miles of the jurisdictional limits of the city of Morro Bay and performs business on a day-to-day basis. Post office boxes shall not be used for the purpose of establishing said physical address. 
The purchasing agent shall not be required to verify the accuracy of any such certifications, and shall have sole discretion to determine if a vendor or consultant meets the definition of "local business." The decision of the purchasing agent declaring that any person or business is not a local business shall be subject to appeal. 
I.  Enforcement. 
1.  The information furnished by each bidder requesting a local business preference shall be under penalty of perjury. 
2.  No person or business shall knowingly and with intent to defraud, fraudulently obtain, retain, attempt to obtain or retain, or aid another in fraudulently obtaining or retaining or attempting to obtain or retain certification as a local business for the purpose of this section. 
3.  No person or business shall willfully and knowingly make a false statement with the intent to defraud, whether by affidavit, report, or other representation, to a city official or employee for the purpose of influencing the certification or denial of certification of any entity as a local business. 
4.  A business which has obtained city certification as a local business by reason of having furnished incorrect supporting information or by reason of having withheld information, and which knew or should have known the information furnished was incorrect or the information withheld was relevant to its request for certification, and which by reason of such certification has been awarded a contract to which it would not otherwise have been entitled, shall: 
a.  Pay to the city any difference between the contract amount and what the city's costs would have been if the contract had been properly awarded; 
b.  In addition to the amount described in subsection (I)(4)(a) above, be assessed a penalty in an amount not more than ten percent of the amount of the contract involved; and 
c.  Be subject to debarment from future award of contracts from the city. 
J.  Promulgation of Administrative Rules. The purchasing agent is authorized to adopt administrative rules supplemental to the provisions of this title as necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section and the rules adopted by the purchasing agent shall be provided to potential bidders, vendors, and contractors to the widest extent practicable.

(Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 2800)  
3.24.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof; and shall further include any space, lot, area or site in any trailer court, recreational vehicle park, mobilehome park, camp, park or lot where a trailer, tent, recreational vehicle, mobile home, motorhome, or other similar conveyance is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his function through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Tax administrator" means the city clerk of the city of Morro Bay. 
G.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel is deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified herein may be considered. 
(Ord. 260 § 1, 1984; Ord. 18 § 1 (part),1965: prior code § 2801)  
3.24.030 - Tax imposed. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 455 § 4, 1996: Ord. 410 § 4, 1991; Ord. 245, 1983: Ord. 158 § 1, 1978: Ord. 70 § 1, 1968: Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 2802)

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter.

"This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting said tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 2805 (part))  
3.24.080 - Reporting and remitting. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator.

C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 2807)  
3.24.100 - Failure to collect and report tax—Determination of tax. 
If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. The operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for the hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such applica-tion is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.24.110. 
(Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 2808)

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to the operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 18 § 1 (part), 1965: prior code § 2809)

One or more deficiency determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made.

For the purposes of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail. 
D.  Within ten days after the date of service of a determination of the amount of tax owed by a person under this chapter, the person may apply in writing to the finance director for a hearing on the determination. If application for a hearing before the city is not timely made, the tax assessed by the finance director shall become final.

1.  The city council delegates its authority to conduct such a hearing on the determination to an independent hearing officer. The compensation of the hearing officer shall not depend on any particular outcome of the appeal.

For good cause, the hearing officer may continue the administrative hearing from time to time. At the hearing the applicant may appear and offer evidence to show why the determination as made by the finance director should not be confirmed and fixed as the tax due. In conducting the hearing, the hearing officer shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. Failure of the person who applied for a hearing on the determination to appear shall not affect the validity of the proceedings or order issued thereon. 
4.  Upon conclusion of the hearing, or no later than ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine and reassess the proper tax to be charged and shall give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this chapter for giving notice of determination, and the hearing officer shall submit its decision and the record to the city clerk.

Chapter 5.14 - TROLLEY OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FEE 
 
5.14.010 - Findings. 
A.  The city council did on the 9th day of May, 1994 conduct a duly noticed public hearing to consider the staff report and testimony of all interested persons. 
B.  Based on such staff report and testimony, the city council has determined that certain areas of the city's waterfront district suffer from a shortage of parking and related congestion problems and would therefore benefit from the operation of a trolley which would permit tourists and others to visit the waterfront without their vehicles. 
C.  The city council has further determined that certain areas of the city's uptown area do not have access to the city's waterfront district due to the parking shortage and related congestion problems and would therefore benefit from the operation of a trolley which would permit persons in the uptown area to visit the waterfront district without their vehicles. 
D.  The city council has further determined that tourists visiting the city's waterfront district often do not visit the city's uptown area because of lack of access thereto and/or lack of knowledge as to the many commercial establishments located in the uptown area and further determines that the uptown area would therefore benefit from increased business activity due to the operation of a trolley connecting the waterfront district with the uptown area. 
E.  In order to confirm the economic feasibility of the trolley, the city council has established a pilot program, whereby a trolley will operate along certain designated routes within the city during the summer and early fall months of 1994. The routes and dates of operation shall be set by the city council by resolution. 
F.  In consideration for the benefits conferred upon them by the operation of the trolley as set forth above, those businesses within one lineal block walking distance of the designated routes shall pay a fee to cover a portion of the actual costs of operating and maintaining the trolley. 
(Ord. 438 § 2 (part), 1994)  
5.14.020 - Payment of fee. 
Every person transacting and carrying on a business within one lineal block walking distance of the designated routes shall pay a fee for operation and maintenance of the trolley in accordance with the master fee schedule as modified from time to time by resolution of the city council. All such trolley operations and maintenance fees shall be due and payable in advance of the first day of July. 
(Ord. 438 § 2 (part), 1994)  
5.14.030 - Separate fees. 
A separate fee must be paid by each branch establishment or location within one lineal block walking distance of the designated routes. If two or more businesses are conducted on the same premises by one person, and the employees are employed by and serve all businesses so located, only one trolley operations and maintenance fee shall be levied. 
(Ord. 438 § 2 (part), 1994)  
5.14.040 - Exemptions. 
The provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed or construed to require the payment of a trolley operations and maintenance fee by any charitable or nonprofit organization, as described in Section 5.04.090 of the code, or any disabled veteran, as described in Section 5.04.100 of the code. Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to this section shall file a verified statement with the collector stating the facts upon which the exemption is claimed. The collector, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for hearing to such person, may require payment of the trolley operations and maintenance fee upon information that such person is not entitled to the exemption as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. 438 § 2 (part), 1994)  
5.14.050 - Expiration.

Chapter 5.32 - MOBILEHOME AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARK RENT STABILIZATION 
Sections: 
 
5.32.010 - Findings and purpose. 
In November 1986, the city council adopted Ordinance No. 294, a mobilehome and recreational vehicle park rent stabilization ordinance providing a formula for maximum annual rent increases and providing a procedure for hardship exceptions, the provisions of which were set forth in former Chapter 5.32 of this code. The findings and purpose set forth in Ordinance No. 294 referred to the following conditions: 
A.  There is presently within the city a shortage of spaces for the location of existing mobilehomes and recreational vehicles. Because of this shortage, there is a very low vacancy rate. 
B.  Within the city there are a number of persons who reside permanently in units which today meet the legal definitions of recreational vehicles. Often these persons subsist on low fixed incomes and are unable to afford standard housing. 
C.  Because of the high cost and impracticability of moving mobilehomes, the potential for damage resulting therefrom, the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes, including permits, building requirements, landscaping and site preparation, the lack of alternative home sites for mobilehome residents, and the substantial investment of mobilehome owners in such homes, it is necessary to protect the owners of mobilehomes from unreasonable rent increases, while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a suitable profit on their property with rental income sufficient to cover increases in the costs of repair, insurance, maintenance, utilities, employee services, additional amenities, and other costs of operation, and to receive a fair return on their property. 
D.  However, it is recognized that a rent stabilization ordinance must be fair and equitable for all parties and must provide appropriate incentives for mobilehome park operators to continue their parks profitably and to upgrade and improve mobilehome parks, as well as to attract additional investors for new parks. 
In April of 2003, the city council established a mobilehome rent stabilization subcommittee to review and consider amendments to the ordinance. The subcommittee consisted of ten members: five park owners and five tenants. The subcommittee held fifteen meetings to consider changes to the ordinance and received public comment. At the end of the meetings the subcommittee unanimously approved the recommended changes to the ordinance and submitted them to the city council. 
The city council hereby finds that the conditions stated in subsections A through D of this section still exist; therefore, the purpose of the city council in enacting these provisions is: to prevent an exploitation of the shortage in vacant mobilehome spaces in the city, to preserve affordable housing as prescribed by the city's general plan/housing element, to provide mobilehome park owners a guaranteed rate of annual space rent increase that more accurately reflects the rate of inflation given their usual expenses, and to establish an improved process for providing mobilehome park owners a fair return on their property in those cases where the guaranteed annual space rent increase provided by these provisions proves to be insufficient. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.020 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases are defined as follows: 
"Affected tenants" means those tenants whose space is not covered by a valid lease meeting the requirements as outlined in Section 798.17(b) of the California Civil Code or otherwise legally exempt from local rent control regulation as set forth in Section 798.21, or as set forth in Section 5.32.030 of this chapter. Affected tenants are to be notified that a space rent increase is to become effective. For purposes of providing notice of the increase, each space subject to a rental increase shall be deemed to have only one "affected tenant" for administrative convenience to the park owners. The reference to "all affected tenants" will refer to one representative tenant from each space subject to the proposed rental increase. 
"Base rent" means the authorized space rent plus any rent increase allowed under Section 5.32.060 or any rent adjustment attributable to an increase upon change of occupancy as provided in Section 5.32.070. Base rent does not include rent increases for capital expenses or capital improvements. 
"Capital improvements" means those improvements that materially add to the value of the property and appreciably prolong its useful life or adapt it to new uses, and which may be amortized over the useful remaining life of the improvement to the property. The term "capital improvements" does not include those costs associated with the normal maintenance and upkeep of facilities and premises which were reasonably intended to be part of consideration provided by the mobilehome park as rent. Substantial rehabilitation of the park that is necessitated as a result of the park owner's neglect, permissive waste, deferred maintenance or acts of God shall not be regarded to be capital improvements to the extent that they restore facilities and premises to the conditions reasonably bargained for by the mobilehome park tenants. Proposed capital improvements claims must set forth an amortization table spreading the cost of the improvement over its proven useful life. Rents based on such costs, if approved, must be separately itemized on the monthly rent invoice. In addition, the beginning date upon which such rents may be imposed and the ending date upon which such rents may no longer be imposed, must be stated on each monthly rent invoice submitted during the time such rents are charged to the tenant. Monthly rent shall be decreased for such amortized capital improvement expenses at the end of the amortization period. Failure to do so shall be regarded to be an unauthorized increase in rent. Capital improvements must be for the primary benefit, use and enjoyment of the tenants of the entire park, and costs must be allocated over all beneficiaries of the improvement. 
"City manager" means the city manager of the city of Morro Bay or his or her designee. 
"Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers Los Angeles, Long Beach, Anaheim Area, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
"Debt service costs" means the periodic payment or payments due under any security or financing device which is applicable to the mobilehome park including any fees, commissions, or other charges incurred in obtaining such financing. 
"Housing service" means a service provided by the owner related to the use or occupancy of a mobilehome space, which is neither a capital improvement nor substantial rehabilitation as those terms are defined in this chapter, including but not limited to, repairs, replacement, maintenance, painting, lighting, heat, water, laundry facilities, refuse removal, recreational facilities, parking, security service, and employee services. 
"Just and reasonable return on the property" means there is a range of rents which could be allowed in any one mobilehome park subject to this chapter, all of which could be characterized as allowing a "just and reasonable return." There is no one precise formulation; rather, there are a variety of formulations which produce a zone of reasonableness. 
"Maintenance and operation expenses" means all expenses incurred in the operation and maintenance of the mobilehome park, including but not limited to: real estate taxes, business taxes and fees, insurance, sewer service charges, utilities, janitorial services, professional property management fees, pool maintenance, exterior building and grounds maintenance, supplies, equipment, refuse removal, and security services or systems. 
"Mobilehome" means a structure designed for human habitation as defined by Section 798.3 of the California Civil Code, provided, however, that recreational vehicles, as defined in Section 799.29 of the California Civil Code and Section 18010 of the California Health and Safety Code, which have occupied the same mobilehome or recreational vehicle park space continuously for nine months or more shall be considered mobilehomes. 
"Mobilehome park" or "recreational vehicle (RV) park" means an area of land where two or more mobilehome or RV sites are rented, or held out for rent, to accommodate mobilehomes or RVs used for human habitation. This rent stabilization chapter shall apply to those spaces in recreational vehicle parks that are continuously occupied by an affected tenant for nine months or longer. 
"Mobilehome park owner" or "owner" means the owner, lessor, operator or manager of a mobilehome park. 
"Mobilehome rent review board" or "board" means the mobilehome rent review board established by this chapter. 
"Mobilehome space" means any site within a mobilehome park located in the incorporated areas of the city intended, designed, or used for the location or accommodation of a mobilehome and any accessory structures or appurtenances attached thereto or used in conjunction therewith except "new construction" as defined by Civil Code Section 798.45. The term "mobilehome space" shall also include, for purposes of this rent stabilization ordinance, rentable spaces within mobilehome parks which have been occupied by a "recreational vehicle" as defined by Civil Code Section 799.29 continuously for a period of nine months or more. 
"Mobilehome tenant" or "tenant" means any person entitled to occupy a mobilehome within a mobilehome park pursuant to ownership of the mobilehome. 
"Net operating income" means gross income less operating expenses. All operating expenses must be reasonable. Whenever a particular expense exceeds the normal industry or other comparable standard, the park owner shall bear the burden of proving the reasonableness of the expense. To the extent that the board finds any such expense to be unreasonable, the board shall adjust the expense to reflect the normal industry or other comparable standard. 
"Nonpermanent resident" means any tenant who does not meet the criteria set forth for a permanent resident. 
"Party" means any affected mobilehome tenant and/or owner involved in proceedings under this chapter. 
"Percent change in Consumer Price Index" means the annual percent change in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), calculated to the nearest tenth, for the twelve-month period from September through August.

"Space rent" means the consideration, including any bonus, benefit, or gratuity, demanded or received by a mobilehome park owner for or in connection with the use or occupancy of a mobilehome space or any housing services provided with the mobilehome space, but exclusive of (1) any amount paid for the use of the mobilehome, (2) security deposits and special amortized or limited rent increases, (3) user fees for services or facilities which may be utilized at the option of the affected tenant and are not included in monthly space rent, and (4) utility charges for those mobilehome parks which charge affected tenants separately, whether or not the mobilehome homes are individually metered. 
"Substantial rehabilitation" means that work done by an owner to a mobilehome space or to the common areas of the mobilehome park, exclusive of a capital improvement as that term is defined in this chapter, the value of which exceeds two hundred dollars and which is performed whether to secure compliance with any state or local law or to repair damage resulting from fire, earthquake, or other casualty or natural disaster, to the extent such work is not reimbursed by insurance. 
"Tenant-to-be" means a person who is not currently a tenant in a mobilehome park but is a prospective mobilehome space tenant who desires the use of a mobilehome space as defined in this chapter and has presented himself or herself to the park owner as such and who would not be exempt under any of the provisions set forth in Section 5.32.030. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)

F.  A notice of rent increase incorporating within it a proposed or completed capital improvement which is not otherwise authorized as a pass-through pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.49 must be claimed within twelve months of the completion of the project or construction or the owner's receipt of the final billing for same, whichever occurs later. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.070 - Increases upon change of occupancy. 
Notwithstanding the twelve-month limitation set forth in Section 5.32.060, upon change of occupancy of a mobilehome, the rent increase upon sale shall be limited to: 
For affected tenants who are permanent residents, ten percent of the current existing space rent or the average of the lowest and highest space rent for all the affected tenants of that particular park, whichever is greater. 
For affected tenants who are nonpermanent residents, fifteen percent of the current existing space rent or the average of the lowest and highest space rent for all the affected tenants of that particular park, whichever is greater. 
Resident status pertains to the selling tenant, not the tenant-to-be. 
The limitations of this increase shall not apply if change in occupancy is due to the involuntary eviction of a tenant. 
No rent increase under this section shall be allowed due to the death of the tenant wherein the deceased tenant's spouse, parents or children take over the occupancy. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.080 - Information to be supplied to tenants. 
A.  Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and prior to the re-renting of each mobilehome space thereafter, the owner shall supply each affected tenant with a current copy of this chapter. 
B.  Whenever the owner serves a notice of rent increase, except a notice of rent increase provided pursuant to Sections 5.32.060(A), (C), or (D) or 5.32.070, the owner shall at the same time and in the same manner serve the affected tenant with a notice that sets forth all of the following information: 
1.  The amount of the rent increase both in dollars and as a percentage of existing rent and documentation supporting the level of increase desired; 
2.  The identity of all other affected tenants and the spaces that they rent; 
3.  The park owner shall place on file with the city manager two copies of documentation supporting the level of increase desired. 
C.  An owner failing to provide an affected tenant and the city manager with the notices required by this section shall not be entitled to collect any rent increase otherwise authorized by this chapter from that tenant. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.090 - The rent dispute resolution process. 
A.  Mandatory Meet-and-Confer Meeting. Except when a park owner elects rent increases permitted under Section 5.32.060(A) or is able to obtain written consent of sixty-six percent of the tenants as set forth in Section 5.32.060(C), the tenants and park owners must, within thirty working days of the notice of rent increase, meet and confer with each other's representatives. Written notice of the time, place and date of the meeting should be arranged within fourteen days of the notice of rent increase. If the park owners or tenants fail to agree on the time, place and date of the hearing and to provide due notice to the city manager, the meeting shall be set at the convenience of the city manager. At the meeting, representatives of the parties should exchange documentary evidence that the parties in good faith then know will be used to support their respective positions in any rent review board hearing and discuss the issues in dispute. In the case of a park owner, all financial data upon which any proposed increase is claimed shall be supplied to tenant representatives at the time of the meet-and-confer meeting. 
1.  Meet-and-Confer Information. The park owner has a duty and burden to provide adequate information in regard to the rental increase to allow the tenants to make a reasonably sophisticated inquiry into the requested rental increase. 
B.  Petition. If discussions between owner and tenants do not resolve the dispute between them, the tenants or their representative shall file with the city manager a petition for space rent review and a copy of the notice of rent increase within thirty days of the meet-and-confer meeting. The city manager shall not accept a petition for filing unless it has been signed by at least fifty-one percent of the affected tenants who are subject to the rent increase. Upon the filing of a petition, the rent increase is not effective and may not be collected until and to the extent it is awarded by the board or until the petition is abandoned. As used in this chapter, the term "abandoned" refers to lack of prosecution of the arbitration by the mobilehome tenants' representative(s). The term "prosecution" refers to actively pursuing necessary steps toward preparing the tenants' case for the arbitration hearing. 
C.  Contents of Petition. 
1.  The petition for space rent review shall set forth the total number of affected rented spaces in the mobilehome park, shall identify the space occupied by each tenant and shall state the date upon which the notice of the rent increase was received by the tenant(s). 
2.  After obtaining the required signatures, the tenant(s) shall deliver the petition or mail it by registered or certified mail to the city manager at the following address: 595 Harbor Street, Morro Bay, California 93442 (or other address as determined by the city manager). No petition shall be accepted unless it is accompanied by the requisite number of signatures and is received in the office of the city manager within the thirty-day period set forth in subsection B of this section. The city manager shall provide a copy of the completed petition form to both parties forthwith or within five working days of the petition's receipt. 
D.  Assignment to Board and Hearing Date. Upon receipt of the petition, or upon notice of any other dispute that requires board resolution, the city manager shall, within thirty working days, commission a mobilehome rent review board as established by Section 5.32.040. The owner and affected tenant(s) shall be notified immediately in writing by the city manager of the date, time, and place of the hearing and this notice shall be served either in person or by ordinary mail. 
E.  Rent Review Board Hearing. 
1.  The owner and tenant(s) may appear at the hearing and offer oral and documentary evidence. Both the owner and tenant(s) may designate up to three representatives to appear for them at the hearing. The board may grant or order one continuance not to exceed five days to each party from the date of the hearing. The burden of proving that the amount of rent increase is reasonable shall be on the owner by a preponderance of the evidence. The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. The rules of evidence and manner of producing evidence shall be those rules set forth in Section 11513 of the California Government Code for the conduct of hearings under the Administrative Procedure Act. These rules may be relaxed at the discretion of the board in the interests of justice. The board shall have the ability to close the hearing to the general public if confidential financial information may be disclosed during the hearing. 
2.  The board shall, within fourteen days of the hearing, submit by mail a written statement of decision and the reasons for the decision to the city manager who shall forthwith distribute by mail copies of the decision to the owner and tenant(s). The board shall determine the amount of rent increase, if any, which is reasonable based upon all the provisions of this chapter. 
3.  Excluding rent increases permitted under Sections 5.32.060(A) and 5.32.070, the board shall not allow more than one rent increase per park per twelve-month period. 
4.  The decision of the board, rendered in accordance with this section, shall be final and binding upon the owner and all affected tenants. The decision of the board will be subject to the provision of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. 
5.  Any party may have electronic recording equipment or a court reporter present to record and prepare a transcript of the hearing before the board; however, such equipment or reporter shall be provided at that party's own expense. 
6.  The board is authorized to modify the basic time periods set forth in this chapter at its discretion to promote the purposes of this program provided a final decision is rendered within ninety days of the notice of rent increase. 
7.  Any procedural or jurisdictional dispute regarding the processes set forth in this chapter may be decided by the board. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.100 - Standards of reasonableness to be applied to rent increases. 
A.  The board shall determine whether rent increases that exceed Section 5.32.060(A) are reasonable under the circumstances, taking into consideration that the purpose of this chapter is to protect home owners from arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable rent increases, and at the same time permit park owners to receive a just and reasonable return on their investment. The board, in making the determination, may, but is not required to, look at the following standards: 
1.  Beneficial increases in maintenance and operating expenses, including but not limited to the reasonable value of the owner's labor and any increased costs for services provided by a public agency, public utility, or quasi-public agency or utility; 
2.  The substantial rehabilitation or the addition of capital improvements, including the reasonable value of the owner's labor, as long as such rehabilitation or improvement has been completed and is: 
a.  Distinguished from ordinary repair or maintenance, 
b.  For the primary benefit, use, and enjoyment of the tenants, 
c.  Permanently fixed in place or relatively immobile and dedicated to the use of the property, 
d.  Not coin-operated nor one for which a "use fee" or other charge is imposed on tenants for its use, 
e.  Cost-factored and amortized over the good faith estimate of the remaining useful life of the rehabilitation or improvement, and 
f.  Does not constitute maintenance of the infrastructure of gas or electrical lines within the mobilehome park for which the public utility has permitted the park owner a special premium with the intent that it be used to replace or otherwise maintain the system within the mobilehome park; 
3.  The rental history of the mobilehome park; 
4.  The occupancy rate of the mobilehome park in comparison to comparable parks in the same general area; 
5.  Existing rents for spaces in other Morro Bay mobilehome parks; 
6.  The physical condition of the mobilehome park, including the quantity and quality of maintenance and repairs performed during the last twelve months, provided, however, that if the home owners raise a lack of maintenance or physical deterioration as an issue, the board shall also consider to what extent the home owners notified the park owner of the physical condition, and to what extent the home owners gave the park owner a reasonable opportunity to cure the physical condition; 
7.  Any increases or reduction in housing services during the twelve months prior to the effective date of the proposed rent increase; 
8.  Debt service costs used for the servicing of existing debt; 
9.  Debt Service Costs Due to Refinancing. If the refinancing is used for extracting equity from the park, the rent increase shall be deemed unreasonable, and the rent increase shall not be allowed. The board may also require that the debt service costs be amortized over a period of years which is determined by the board to be reasonable; 
10.  A decrease in "net operating income" as defined in Section 5.32.020(P); 
11.  A decrease in the owner's "just and reasonable return on the property" as defined in Section 5.32.020(H); 
12.  Other financial information that the owner is willing to provide; 
13.  Any costs incurred as a result of a natural disaster and only to the extent such costs have not been reimbursed to the owner by insurance or other sources and where such costs could not have been prevented by normal maintenance and repair. 
B.  In any determination of what constitutes a reasonable rent increase under the circumstances, the board shall consider and weigh evidence establishing the nature and extent of any existing and/or outstanding violations by either the park owners or home owners. Any rent increase or decrease may be disallowed, reduced, or made subject to reasonable conditions, depending on the severity of such violations. 
C.  Changes in ownership of the park after the effective date of this chapter shall not entitle any succeeding park owner to higher rents than would have been paid if the original owner had remained the park owner without board approval. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.110 - Obligations of the parties. 
A.  If a final decision by the board finds that a proposed increase or any portion thereof that was previously inoperative is justified, the tenant shall pay the amount found justified to the owner within thirty days after the decision is made or as otherwise ordered by the board. 
B.  If a final decision by the board finds that an increase or any portion thereof is not justified, the owner shall refund any amount found to be unjustified, but that had been paid, to the tenant within thirty days after the decision is made or as otherwise ordered by the board. If such refund is not made within the applicable time period, the tenant may withhold the amount from the next space rent(s) due until the full amount of the refund has been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the tenancy of tenant is terminated for any reason prior to full credit against rent, the balance of the credit due the tenant shall be paid by the owner within thirty days from the date of the termination of the tenancy. 
C.  Any sum of money that under the provisions of this section is the obligation of the owner or tenant, as the case may be, shall constitute a debt and, subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, may be collected in any manner provided by law for the collection of debts. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.120 - Rights of a "tenant-to-be." 
Any person who is a "tenant-to-be" as defined in Section 5.32.020(X) must be offered the option of renting a mobilehome space in a manner which will permit the tenant-to-be to receive the benefits of the mobilehome space rent stabilization program described in this chapter, which includes, but is not limited to, rental of a mobilehome space on a month-to-month basis, and a new base rent. Such a person cannot be denied the option of a tenancy twelve months or less in duration. The park owner shall provide each "tenant-to-be" with a written notification of the option which shall make the following recitation: 
UNDER MORRO BAY MUNICIPAL CODE SECTION 5.32 YOU ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO ELECT A MONTH-TO-MONTH TENANCY OVER ANY OTHER LONGER PERIODIC TENANCY. YOU ARE ADVISED THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ENTITLED TO RENT STABILIZATION (RENT CONTROL) PROGRAM BENEFITS IF YOU ELECT A LEASE OF MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS IN DURATION IF THAT LEASE MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF CIVIL CODE SECTION 798.17 WHICH HAS BEEN ATTACHED HERETO. 
Any effort to circumvent the requirements of this section is unlawful, as well as an unfair business practice subject to enforcement under Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq. The rights set forth in this section have no application to mobilehome spaces subject to a more-than-twelve-month lease. By definition, tenants-to-be are prospective "mobilehome tenants," and such "affected tenants" are defined by Section 5.32.020. 
Providing a copy of this chapter to tenants shall be deemed compliance with this section. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.130 - Tenants' right of refusal. 
A tenant may refuse to pay any increase in rent which is in violation of this chapter, provided a petition has been filed and either no final decision has been reached by the board or the increase has been determined to violate the provisions of this chapter. Such refusal to pay shall be a defense in any action brought to recover possession of a mobilehome space or to collect the rent increase. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.140 - Retaliatory acts—Tenants' right to organize. 
No owner may retaliate against a tenant or tenant-to-be for the tenant's or tenant-to-be's assertion or exercise of rights under this chapter in any manner, including but not limited to, threatening to bring or bringing an action to recover possession of a mobilehome space; engaging in any form of harassment that causes a tenant to quit the premises; dissuading a tenant-to-be from freely exercising his or her legal options to chose a month-to-month rental; decreasing housing services; increasing the space rent; or imposing or increasing a security deposit or any other charge payable by a tenant. The tenants have a right to organize a tenants' association without hindrance from the park owner to exercise the rights provided under the provisions of the Morro Bay Municipal Code. This association may be referred to as "The Park Tenants' Association at (Park Name)." 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.150 - Solicitation of any petition by the park owner is without force or legal effect within city's program. 
The distribution of a petition or other documents seeking to have mobilehome tenants waive rights, abandon a filed petition or in any way affect the entitlement of the tenants to participate in the rent stabilization process authorized under this chapter shall be without force or legal effect within the city's rent stabilization program. Such documents shall not affect the right of any tenant to participate in the rights, remedies, procedures and processes set forth in this chapter. Efforts to utilize such documents to discourage participation in the city's rent stabilization program may be deemed retaliatory. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.160 - Nonwaiverability. 
Any provision, whether oral or written, in or pertaining to a rental agreement whereby any provision of this chapter is waived or modified, is against public policy and void, except with respect to any rental agreement complying with all of the terms and conditions set forth in Section 798.17 of the California Civil Code. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.170 - Penalties and remedies. 
Any owner who demands, accepts, receives, or retains any money as rent from a tenant to which the owner is not entitled under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to the tenant for any actual damages, attorney's fees, and costs incurred by the tenant as a consequence and the tenant may seek relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction for injunctive relief and damages. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.180 - Rights of affected tenants reserved. 
This chapter shall not be construed to limit or curtail any other action or proceeding which may be pursued by an affected tenant against an owner before any court or other body having jurisdiction thereof. 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.190 - Tenant complaints. 
Any affected tenant may file a complaint with the city manager for the purpose of contesting any rent increase and/or to enforce any provision of this chapter. Prior to and as a condition to such filing, the tenant must meet and confer with the owner to attempt to informally resolve their differences. The owner shall make himself or herself available for the meeting and conferring within a reasonable time after being requested to do so by the tenant, but no later than thirty days thereafter. If applicable, the owner shall comply with Section 5.32.080. If such informal resolution cannot be had, then the tenant (hereinafter referred to as "complainant") may file with the city manager (and contemporaneously deliver a copy to the owner) his or her complaint. All such complaints shall describe in detail the basis therefor and shall attach, where available and necessary to a full understanding of the complaint, documents and writings which support the complaint. Upon receiving such a complaint, the city manager shall assign the matter to the board in accordance with Section 5.32.090(D) and the matter shall be arbitrated in conformance with Section 5.32.090(E). 
(Ord. 499 (part), 2004)  
5.32.200 - Severability. 
The ordinance enacting this chapter shall be liberally construed to achieve its purposes and preserve its validity. If any provision or clause of this chapter or application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable and are intended to have independent validity.

It is the intent of the council to prohibit nudity or other specified offensive conduct in such places, irrespective of sexual motives or conduct.

The city will make every attempt to equally distribute the calls-for-service on a "rotation" basis. The city retains the right to assign at its election, where in its sole discretion it determines that a particular service or equipment is required and convenience to the particular need, which would permit them, when they feel a particular operator can service a particular need better than another, or has equipment more appropriate than another, to exercise discretion in the assignment.

Sections: 
 
13.08.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is: 
A.  To protect the public water supply against actual or potential cross-connections by isolating within the premises contamination or pollution that may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized cross-connection on the premises; 
B.  To eliminate existing connections between drinking water systems and other sources of water that are not approved as safe and potable for human consumption; 
C.  To eliminate cross-connections between drinking water systems and other sources of water or process water used for any purpose whatsoever which jeopardize the safety of the drinking water supply; 
D.  To prevent the making of cross-connections in the future; 
E.  To encourage the exclusive use of public sources of water supply; 
F.  To protect the drinking water supply within the premises where plumbing defects or cross-connections may endanger the drinking water supply available on the premises. 
It is the intent of this chapter to recognize that there are varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree or protection should be commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
(Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.1)  
13.08.020 - Definitions.

N.  Pollution. "Pollution" means an impairment of the quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely affect such waters for domestic use. 
O.  Pollution Hazard. "Pollution hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the public water system or the potability of the public water supply, but which would not constitute a health or system hazard, as defined in this section. 
P.  Purveyor. "Purveyor" means any person, corporation, public utility, municipality, district or other agency or institution furnishing or supplying water for domestic purposes. 
Q.  Service Connection. "Service connection" means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the consumer's water system. If a meter is installed then the service connection means the down-stream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected take-offs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the consumer's water system.

This shall include the handling of processed waters, and waters originating from the public water supply system which have been subject to deterioration in sanitary quality. 
C.  Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on the service connection to any premises that have cross-connections. It shall be the responsibility of the consumer to provide, test, and maintain protective devices as required. 
(Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.4)  
13.08.050 - Type of protection. 
The protective device required shall depend on the degree of hazard. In determining the degree of hazard and the type of backflow prevention to be required, the following criteria shall by used: 
A.  An air-gap separation shall be used where there is a health hazard. The air-gap shall be located as close as practicable to the meter and all piping between the meter and the receiving tank shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot reasonably be met, the public water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device, providing the alternative is acceptable to the department. 
B.  An air-gap separation or a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be used where there is a system hazard or a plumbing hazard or any combination of the above. If an air-gap separation is used, the air-gap shall be located as close as practicable to the meter and all piping between the meter and receiving tank shall be entirely visible. Where there is no meter the protective device shall be located on the service connection pipeline at a point on the consumer's property nearest the public water supply pipeline. 
C.  In all other cases of cross-connection, there shall be required a double check valve assembly. 
D.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, at the service connection to any sewage treatment plant, sewage pumping station, or storm water pumping station, the public water supply shall be protected by an air-gap separation. The air-gap shall be located as close as practicable to the meter and all piping between the meter and receiving tank shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot be reasonably met, the public water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device, providing this alternative is acceptable to the department. Final decision in this matter shall rest with the state department of public health. 
E.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, on any premises where the county health department determines that a special hazard exists, the public water supply shall be protected by such approved backflow prevention devices as designated by the department. 
(Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.5)  
13.08.060 - Frequency of inspection of protective devices. 
It shall be the duty of the consumer on any premises on which backflow protective devices are installed to have competent inspections made at least once a year or more often in those instances where successive inspections indicate defective operation. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the water user whenever they are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and submitted to the department. 
(Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.6)  
13.08.070 - Inspection and maintenance qualification and certification. 
A.  No person shall be qualified to inspect and maintain backflow prevention devices unless his qualifications have been established to the satisfaction of the department as hereinafter required. To determine the qualifications of any person to inspect and maintain backflow prevention devices, the department shall have the authority to conduct examinations as necessary. Upon successful completion of such examination and such training as the department shall prescribe, the person so examined shall receive from the department a "certificate of competence." Any limitations or conditions imposed by the department on the examinee in the inspection and maintenance of backflow prevention devices shall be stated upon the face of said certificate issued to the examinee. The department shall make available to consumers, a list of persons qualified to inspect and maintain backflow prevention devices. Every person, after receiving a certificate of competence from the department, shall be issued such identification as the department deems appropriate; and such identification shall be kept in the immediate possession of every person holding a certificate of competence while said person is inspecting or maintaining any backflow prevention device in the county. 
B.  Every person desiring to qualify to inspect or maintain backflow prevention devices shall make application to the department. At the time of making application, every person shall pay a fee in accordance with the Master Fee Schedule, which shall not be refundable. Said fee shall cover the expense of the department in processing the applications, certificates of competence, and any documents of identification required by the department. 
C.  Every person holding a certificate of competence issued by the department under the provisions of this chapter shall be required to renew said certificate every three years. The requirements for re-examination may be waived at the discretion of the department. 
D.  Every person receiving a certificate of competence under the provisions of this chapter shall be responsible for the competency and accuracy of all inspections and maintenance performed by him on any backflow prevention device. 
E.  Any person issued a certificate of competence who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or willingly falsifies inspection or maintenance reports submitted to the department shall, in addition to the penalties prescribed in Chapter 1.04 of the San Luis Obispo County Ordinance Code, have the certificate immediately revoked, and shall not be considered for recertification for a period of two years. 
(Ord. 225 § 65, 1982; Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.7)  
13.08.080 - Booster pump regulation. 
When it becomes necessary, because of low pressure or special operating conditions, to install a booster pump on the service of any premises, such pump shall be equipped with a low pressure cutoff switch designed to shut off the pump when the pressure on the inlet side of 25 P.S.I.G. or lower. It shall be the duty of the consumer to maintain the cutoff device in proper working order, and to certify to the department at least once a year that the device is operable. 
(Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.8)  
13.08.090 - Protection of water system within premises. 
A.  Whenever the department determines that drinking water systems on a premises cannot be protected against entry of water from any piping system, equipment or other source not safe or potable for human use, an entirely separate drinking water system shall be installed to supply water at convenient points. 
B.  Water systems for fighting fire, derived from a supply that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use shall, wherever practicable, be kept wholly separate from drinking water pipelines and equipment. In cases where the domestic water system is used for both drinking and firefighting purposes, approved backflow prevention devices shall be installed to protect such individual drinking water lines as are not used for firefighting purposes. The users of such drinking water systems shall be further protected as prescribed by the state and county health departments. 
C.  Potable water pipelines connected to equipment for industrial processes or operations shall be disconnected therefrom if practicable. Where disconnection is not practicable, an approved backflow prevention device, the type or kind depending on the degree of hazard, shall be located in the feedline to the process piping or equipment, beyond the last point from which drinking water may be taken. In the event the particular processed liquid is especially corrosive or apt to prevent reliable action of the backflow prevention device, an air-gap separation shall be provided. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced whenever they are found to be defective. Records of tests, repairs, and replacement shall be kept and submitted to the department. 
D.  Sewage pumps and storm water pumps shall not have priming connections directly off any drinking water systems, unless the drinking water system is protected by an air-gap and no connection shall exist between the drinking water system and any other piping equipment or tank in any sewage treatment plant, sewage pumping station, or storm water pumping station. 
E.  Backflow protections by an approved backflow protection device operating under the reduced pressure principle shall be provided on each drinking water outlet used for supplying ships or other vessels at piers or waterfronts. These devices must be located where they will prevent the return of water from any ship or vessel into another adjacent ship or vessel or into the public water system. 
F.  Where the premises contain dual or multiple water systems and piping, the exposed portions of pipelines shall be painted, banded or marked at sufficient intervals to distinguish clearly which water is safe. All outlets from other than approved water supply systems shall be posted as being unsafe for drinking purposes. All outlets intended for drinking purposes shall be plainly marked to indicate that fact. 
(Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.9)  
13.08.100 - Water supervisor. 
At each premises where it is necessary, in the opinion of the department, a water supervisor shall be designated. 
(Ord. 95 § 1 (part), 1971: prior code § 3301.10)  
13.08.110 - Penalties for noncompliance. 
The water purveyor shall have the authority to immediately discontinue service to any premises where cross-connections or other hazards to the water system are found to exist, and shall not again render service to said premises until such conditions are eliminated in accordance with this chapter. Any consumer who wilfully violates any of the provisions of this chapter or alters, or bypasses or renders inoperative any backflow prevention device installed under the provisons of this chapter shall, in addition to immediate discontinuance of water service be subject to penalties prescribed in Chapter 1.16 of this code. Service shall not again be rendered until such violation of noncompliance has been corrected.

13.20.010 - Intent and findings. 
A.  The intent of this chapter is to regulate the addition of new water users to the city's water system, whether new construction, expansions or new occupancies, to ensure that demand for water shall not exceed available supply and that the pace of allocating the available water supply to new users is reasonable and orderly. 
B.  The city presently has a limited amount of water resources; this fact is not only recognized by the city but also by the state of California in various actions of the California Coastal Commission limiting new development within the city limits. New water users must be regulated, accordingly, to ensure that demand does not exceed supply and that the pace of development using available water is orderly and reasonable. 
C.  The regulations established by this chapter may effectively limit the number of housing units which may be constructed on an annual basis, but such limitation is necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. If water use exceeded supply and adequate water were not available to users, then there could result in increased fire hazard, adverse impacts on commerce, industry and recreation, and the public health, safety and welfare would generally be jeopardized. 
D.  By "development that occurs in an orderly fashion" is meant development which can be served by public utilities, including, but not limited to, water resources and delivery systems, which encourages infill in existing developed parts of the city rather than in large undeveloped areas along the perimeter of the community, and which helps to implement the policies and priorities articulated in the city general plan and local coastal program. 
E.  Similarly, the public health, safety and welfare is promoted by regulating the pace of new development so that it occurs in an orderly fashion. Such development helps preserve the community's character, enhances the attractiveness of the city, better implements adopted plans, policies and priorities for the physical growth of the city, and tends toward a more efficient use of available resources including but not necessarily limited to water and water delivery systems. 
F.  Water equivalency units, as defined herein, are established to assist the city in regulating the addition of new water users to the city's limited water system. One water equivalency unit has been considered as equal to what is used by an average single family residence. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.020 - Definitions. 
The following definitions shall be used for interpreting this chapter: 
"Director" means the city's public works director. 
"Project" means new construction, additions to existing facilities, changes or intensification of use or occupancies in an existing facility, or demolition and replacement of existing facilities. 
"Water equivalency program" means a program adopted each year that establishes the total number of water equivalency units to be allocated for the coming fiscal year, and the method of dispersing and administering water equivalency units through the year. 
"Water equivalency table" means a table that indicates the average annual water use of different land uses that is used in calculating how many water equivalency units a proposed project needs. 
"Water equivalency units" means a unit of measure for water use equal to the average amount of water used by a single-family residence over the period of one year. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.030 - Responsibilities of the director. 
The director is charged with: 
A.  Submitting an annual water report to the city council, public works advisory board and planning commission; 
B.  Reviewing and approving the water equivalency units required by individual projects; 
C.  Monitoring the water equivalency program during each year; 
D.  Periodically updating the basis for a water equivalency unit and the water equivalency table and adjusting them based on significant changes of water consumption by land use type; and 
E.  Developing operating procedures for the administration of the water equivalency program and allocating water equivalency units established for the year to projects, in accordance with the water equivalency program. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.040 - Submission of annual report by the public works director. 
A.  By June of each year, and subsequently in the following year based on a significant change in the water availability situation or recalculation of use by type of activity, the director shall submit a report to the city council, public works advisory board and planning commission outlining the number of uses receiving water equivalency units the previous year, the number of water equivalency units distributed, and the number of water equivalency units to be allocated for that year to projects. 
B.  The planning commission and public works advisory board (PWAB) shall consider this report and forward it to the city council with its recommendations. The city council shall thereafter hold a public meeting and shall take action to adopt a water equivalency program for the year. 
C.  The city council shall consider the annual report at a regularly scheduled council meeting and make any changes to the annual water report and operating procedures for the administration of the water equivalency program, as it deems appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.050 - Responsibilities of the city council. 
A.  By June 15th of each year, the city council shall adopt a water equivalency program for the next fiscal year by resolution. 
B.  The city council shall also review the operating procedures for administration of the water equivalency program developed by the director. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.060 - Reserved.  
13.20.070 - Water equivalency table. 
The water equivalency table as approved by city council resolution indicates the average annual water use of different land uses and building types relative to that of a single-family dwelling. The water equivalency table shall be followed when calculating the water equivalency units needed by individual projects or to be credited to existing or discontinued land uses as set forth in Section 13.20.080. The water equivalency table shall be reviewed by the director semiannually and any modifications that reflect changes in water use shall be approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.080 - Allocation of water equivalency units to projects. 
A.  No project as defined in this chapter shall be permitted unless it is first reviewed by the director to ascertain whether it will increase likely water usage and thereby needs water equivalency units. The director shall use the water equivalency table referred to in Section 13.20.070 for determining water equivalency units for various uses. If a particular use is not listed on the water equivalency table, then the Director shall estimate the water equivalency units for that use. Generally, the water usage records of a sample of like uses already operating in the city shall be used if available. The time frame for the sampling should be at least seven years of use if available. Any other relevant information may be used in making a reasonable estimate. The director's decisions regarding estimates of water usage may not be appealed. If a proposed project, as defined in this chapter, is found to require water equivalency units, then it shall not be approved for construction, or, in cases of changes to, or the expansion or intensification of existing uses, the occupancy shall not be approved, until and unless the required water equivalency units have been obtained in accordance with the annual water equivalency program, except as provided in this section. 
B.  The following types of projects shall not be required to obtain water equivalency units through the water equivalency program: 
1.  Any projects which involves the demolition of a building where the number of water equivalency units required by the new uses is less than or equal to those credited to the demolished building(s). Water equivalency units credited to demolished buildings shall be limited to the highest number of water equivalency units credited to legally permitted uses which have existed in the building since January 1, 1977, based upon the most current water equivalency table referred to in Section 13.20.070 of this code. Any building demolished prior to January 1, 1977 shall not be credited with water equivalency units. "Legally permitted" buildings, uses or occupancies shall mean: any building, use or occupancy for which any required use permit, building permit or business license had been secured and validated, or any legal nonconforming use. 
2.  Any project which involves the replacement of a use or occupancy where the number of water equivalency units required by the new use or occupancy is less than or equal to those credited to the highest number of water equivalency units credited to legally permitted, non-temporary uses, which have existed in the building since January 1, 1977, based upon the most current water equivalency table referred to in Section 13.20.070 of this code. Any use or occupancy discontinued prior to 1977 shall not be credited with equivalency units. 
3.  Any project which is an addition to an existing facility and includes the retrofit of existing fixtures in that existing facility such that the water equivalency units saved by the retrofit is greater than or equal to the water equivalency units required by the new use. The director shall estimate the water equivalency units saved by a proposed retrofit; the director may request the project proponent to supply whatever information is deemed necessary to help estimate water savings. 
4.  Additions or expansions to residential uses, motels, hotels, campground or other uses for which water equivalency units are based on number of units so long as such additions or expansion does not involve an increase in number of units. 
5.  Family day care homes, as defined in Section 17.12.272 of this code, as may be amended. 
C.  A project proponent may obtain water equivalency units for the project by implementation of an approved off-site retrofit program of existing water fixtures or other water conservation measure, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  All proposals for off-site retrofit programs or other water conservation measures shall be submitted to the planning director who shall estimate the number of water equivalency units such proposal would save. Additionally, if retrofit is proven to be infeasible, the payment of an in-lieu fee in the amount approved by the city council and listed in the Master Fee Schedule will satisfy this requirement. 
2.  Any such proposal may be subject to review and approval by the city council and, if deemed necessary, by the California Coastal Commission; provided, however, that if a proposal complies with the guidelines prepared pursuant to this section and approved by the city council, it may be approved by the director. 
3.  In order to allow a large margin of error in estimated savings and to help reduce overall demand on the city's already constrained water resources, no more than one-half of the water savings from a project resulting from a retrofit proposal may be credited to a new use or development project. 
4.  This option shall not include replacement by private developers of leaky water mains. 
5.  In order to better implement city objectives and policies to promote infill development, only projects defined as infill pursuant to the definition adopted in the operating procedures shall be eligible to obtain water equivalency units pursuant to this section. 
6.  The director shall prepare guidelines for the administration of retrofit program which shall be reviewed at least once a year by the city council and which shall be subject to council's approval. 
7.  Once a year, in May, the director shall submit a report to the city council summarizing the experience to date of all retrofit proposals. Prior to submission to the council, such reports shall be reviewed by the public works advisory board (PWAB), and all recommendations made by the PWAB shall be included among the materials submitted to the council. Based on those reports and PWAB recommendations, the council may modify the guidelines for the program as deemed appropriate. 
8.  In any program under which the city assists developers in locating structures to be retrofitted, priority shall be given to residences of low-income households. 
D.  If a project needs to obtain water equivalencies units pursuant to the water equivalency program, then the project proponent shall make application for the water equivalency program in the form of a completed application for a building permit and shall be submitted to the city; provided, however, that for projects which do not require a building permit, a letter requesting the required water equivalency units shall be submitted to the department instead. The director shall determine the number of water equivalency units needed by the proposed project. The director shall periodically forward requests to the planning commission for allocation of available water equivalency units, in accordance with the annual water equivalency program. 
E.  The planning commission shall allocate the required water equivalency units to the proposed project only if it can make the following findings: 
1.  The project is consistent with city planning regulations; all applicable local discretionary permits shall be approved prior to a project's being eligible to receive any water equivalency unit allocations; 
2.  There are enough water equivalency units available to be allocated to the specific type of use for which application has been made; and 
3.  A water equivalency units allocation to the proposed project is consistent with the water equivalency program adopted for the year. 
F.  Applications for water equivalency units will be reviewed by the public works department and considered for water equivalency units allocation on the basis of time and the date of receipt of the completed application by the public works department. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.083 - Priority for affordable housing developments. 
A.  For the purpose of this section, moderate, low and very low income persons shall be defined as set forth in California Health and Safety Code Sections 50079.5 and 50105. "Affordable housing" means housing affordable to persons and families with moderate, low and very low incomes. 
B.  In any given year at the time any water equivalency units allocation are authorized by the city council, priority on the residential building permit waiting list shall be given for developments which provide a minimum of fifty percent of housing which will be guaranteed to be affordable to persons and families with moderate, low and very low incomes; provided, however, that not more than fifty percent of the building permits allocated each year for single-family dwellings or multifamily dwellings by the city council pursuant to Ordinance No. 266 shall be so prioritized. Developments which provide a minimum of fifty percent of affordable housing including a minimum of twenty-five percent affordable to low- and very low-income families shall have a priority over projects for affordable housing, which do not provide units for low and very low-income families. Also, developments which provide one hundred percent affordable housing shall have a priority over projects which provide fifty percent affordable housing. 
The remaining permits shall be allocated in accordance with the existing waiting list. 
C.  An applicant desiring low-income housing priority shall submit to the public works department, a written request for such priority, listing the applicant/owner, the address and legal description of the project property, and written deed restrictions and agreements as approved by the city attorney, restricting the sale and occupancy of the affordable units in the project to moderate-, low- or very low-income persons for a period of thirty years after completion of the housing project. Upon receipt of this information and agreements, the applicant's property will be placed on a separate low-income housing waiting list for either single-family or multiple-family projects in the order in which the requests are received by the city to be eligible for priority in the following year's water allocation. 
D.  If a project due to be awarded water fails to qualify or submit sufficient deed restrictions and agreements, as required in this section, prior to the award of water, or voluntarily withdraws, then the project shall be removed from the priority list and shall be returned to its original position on the long-term building allocation waiting list. 
E.  The city, at its option, may contract with a nonprofit housing agency to provide for administration of various aspects of deed restrictions, agreements and other procedures to ensure the effectiveness of this program to provide long-term low income housing. Costs for such services shall be borne by the applicant/developer. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.085 - Special building allocation. 
A.  During any fiscal year in which the city council determines not to award all of the water equivalency units allocations permitted by Ordinance No. 266, the city council may by resolution, authorize building permits to be issued for new uses within the limits established in Ordinance No. 266 to those projects, which because they have pre-existing water equivalency units on-site, have no necessity for new water equivalency units allocation from the city. 
B.  Proposals for residential projects which are being converted from former nonresidential uses or for residential redevelopment projects which increase the number of residential units on the property may be eligible to be considered for a special building allocation when those projects: 
1.  Have sufficient pre-existing water equivalency units on-site due to prior water use on that property, 
2.  Are consistent with the annual building allocation established by the council as required by Ordinance No. 266, and 
3.  Will not require more water equivalency units for the current use to be converted than the amount set forth in the water equivalency table, adopted by council resolution, as referred to in Section 13.20.070. 
C.  Upon receipt of a redevelopment application, and verification by the planning director that the proposal conforms to the above requirements and all other requirements of this code, the application will be processed in the normal manner required for any necessary discretionary approvals. The director, on a quarterly basis, shall provide the city council a list of all redevelopment projects having obtained all necessary discretionary approvals during that quarter. The council may authorize the director to issue building permits to such projects in accordance with the limitations of the special building allocation for that calendar year. During each quarterly authorization, those projects highest on the long-term waiting list shall have priority over other applicants for access to the available special allocation permits, except as set forth in subsection D of this section. 
D.  In accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 13.20.083 of this code, and as subsequently amended, projects which qualify as low- and very low-income housing developments shall be given priority to special building allocation permits over other applications. 
E.  Special building allocations will have not be allowed to carryovers water equivalency units from one calendar year to the next; therefore, in the event a project requires more water equivalency units than the number of remaining water equivalency units available through the allocation, the project proponent may reduce the number of units proposed which require water equivalency units, or the next project in line that can be satisfied shall receive the award. 
F.  Any applicants applying to participate in a special building allocation, but who (i) fails to meet the criteria above, (ii) fails to obtain any required approvals, or (iii) meets the criteria but withdraw the request, shall be returned to that applicant's original relative position on the long-term building allocation list. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.090 - Reserved.  
13.20.100 - Nontransferability of water equivalency units. 
A.  A water equivalency unit shall be awarded only to a specific project in a specific location. Minor amendments to projects, which do not change the type or intensity of use, may be approved without loss of allocated water equivalency units, so long as the project and site do not change. 
B.  A water equivalency unit that has been allocated to a specific project cannot be transferred to another project or property. 
C.  A project proponent must be the record owner of a property in order to be eligible to obtain water equivalency units. 
D.  Water equivalency units shall run with the project and the property. New owners of properties which have received water equivalency units credit shall notify the city within forty-five days after close of escrow. 
E.  The limitations outlined in this section shall be effective as of September 27, 1993. 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.110 - Time limit for using water equivalency units. 
A.  If water equivalency units have been awarded to a project by the planning commission, then that award shall remain in force for the period in which all applicable (related) discretionary and ministerial and administrative approvals are valid. 
B.  Any extensions granted to such permits prior to their expiration shall automatically extend the water equivalency units award to the new expiration date. Expiration of a project's conditional use permit or coastal development permit or other ministerial or administrative approval shall result in the expiration of water equivalency units awarded the project. Allocation of water equivalency units expiring in this manner cannot be reinstated. In such cases, new water allocations must be obtained for new or reactivated projects on a property. 
C.  For existing commercial uses, industrial uses and other nonresidential uses, retrofit of on-site facilities may be credited on that property for potential further expansions or new nonresidential uses pursuant to the following standards: 
1.  The water equivalency units earned by the retrofit must be maintained on-site and cannot be transferred to another property; and 
2.  The water equivalency units earned are all from on-site retrofit of that property pursuant to a retrofit program approved by the director consistent with these regulations and shall be valid for five years from the date of the retrofit; and 
3.  This retrofit need not be tied to any specific current projects but may apply to any future nonresidential expansions and/or more intensive nonresidential use on-site; and 
4.  In the event of the contemplated sale of the subject property, the retrofit application and replacement work shall be initiated and completed prior to the time of sale; sale defined as last condition precedent to the sale being satisfied; and 
5.  The retrofit water equivalency units earned can be transferred to a new owner but must remain with the same property (see subsection (C)(1)). 
(Ord. No. 603, § 2, 6-14-16)  
13.20.120 - Limitations on allocations of water. 
A.  The city shall not allocate any water equivalency units to new use on the basis of: 
1.  Any project performed by the city or on city-managed property; 
2.  Any water savings that was not derived from, or accomplished by, a specific city-approved and city-contracted project; 
3.  Any project, or part thereof, that has previously earned any water equivalency units credit for allocation. Thus, a toilet facility, whose retrofit had earned allotment credit, shall not become a factor in a subsequent retrofit by another fixture replacement; 
4.  Past, present or future replacement of the city water pipes; 
5.  An excess of fifty percent of that water saved from any project. No more than one-half of the savings from a project shall be so allocated; 
6.  An increase in the amount originally contracted for allocation from a project; or 
7.  Mandated projects, measures or procedures, including compulsory retrofitting of private property and forced rationing of water use. 
B.  The word "project," as used in this section, shall denote any measure, act, process or procedure by which the consumption of potable city water may be assumed, or expected, to decrease and thereby legally permit the allocation of city water to new use. 
C.  Any water equivalency units allotment to nonprofit public facilities which are supported by public funds shall be exempt from subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of subsection A of this section.

14.44.080 - Appeals. 
Any person aggrieved by the requirements of this section shall have the right to appeal to the planning commission. If an appeal is made, it must be filed with the community development department not later than ten calendar days after the applicant is formally notified of the required improvements. The appeal shall state the reason why the requirements are inconsistent with the provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter and should not be applied. The planning commission may grant the appeal and waive all or part of the requirements when, based on a report by the director of public works, it is determined the following conditions exist: 
A.  That the waiver of improvements shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and district in which the subject property is situated; 
B.  That because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this section is found to deprive subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical zone classification; 
C.  That the waiver is found inconsistent with the intent of the general plan; 
D.  That such improvements already exist in good condition and conform to city standard specifications on the entire property frontage; 
E.  The property involved is part of an area within which construction of such improvements has been budgeted by the city, or is within an approved assessment district; 
F.  That waiver of the required improvements will not create potential safety hazards for pedestrians or motorists, cause a liability for the city, result in drainage problems, or compromise handicapped accessibility requirements. 
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission shall have the right of further appeal to the city council on the same basis as the appeal to the planning commission.

The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Morro Bay does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Morro Bay are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
7.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
D.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means the ordinance codified in this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

"Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 14.72.060 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

"Hardship" as related to Section 14.72.060, of this title means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The flood openings standard in Section 14.72.050(A)(3)(C); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 14.72.050(A)(1); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 14.72.050(A)(2); 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 14.72.050(B). 
2.  For residential structures in special flood hazard areas, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
"Market value" is defined in the city of Morro Bay substantial damage/improvement procedures. See Section 14.72.040(C)(2)(a).

"New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after November 13, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after November 13, 1979. 
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
One-Hundred-Year Flood or 100-Year Flood. See "Base flood." 
"Primary frontal dune" means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms.

"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement.

14.72.030 - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to Which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of Morro Bay. 
B.  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for San Luis Obispo County, California, and Incorporated Areas dated August 28, 2008, and accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), dated August 28, 2008, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this title and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this title and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study and FIRM are on file at the department of Public Services, 955 Shasta Avenue, Morro Bay. 
C.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this title and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
D.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where the ordinance codified in this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this title, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
F.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This title does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This title shall not create liability on the part of city council, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this title or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
G.  Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
H.  Standards of Construction. Structure freeboard requirements have increased from one to two feet above the base flood elevation in the 2012 revision of the ordinance codified in this chapter. New construction and substantial improvements to existing structures with start of construction after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter must comply with these new requirements. 
(Ord. No. 564, 11-8-10; Ord. No. 579, 8-14-12)  
14.72.040 - Administration. 
A.  Establishment of Development Permit.

f.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; and 
g.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed, as required in Section 14.72.050(A)(3)(b) of this chapter and detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 3-93. 
2.  Certification from a registered civil engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed building meets the floodproofing criteria in Section 14.72.050(A)(3)(b). 
3.  For a crawl-space foundation, location and total net area of foundation openings as required in Section 14.72.050(A)(3)(c) of this chapter and detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletins 1-93 and 7-93. 
4.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
5.  All appropriate certifications listed in Section 14.72.040(C)(4) of this chapter. 
B.  Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The city engineer is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this title by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
C.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
1.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that: 
a.  Permit requirements of this title have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
b.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
c.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
d.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this title, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Morro Bay; and 
e.  All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
2.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
a.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value." 
b.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
3.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 14.72.030(B), the floodplain administrator may obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 14.72.050. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of the simplified or detailed methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas — A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995; 
4.  Notification of Other Agencies: 
a.  In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
i.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation, 
ii.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and 
iii.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained; 
b.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
i.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
ii.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
c.  Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
5.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:

e.  Certification required by Section 14.72.050(F)(1) (floodway encroachments); 
f.  Information required by Section 14.72.050(G)(6) (coastal construction standards); 
g.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
6.  Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 14.72.060. 
7.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this title as specified in Section 14.72.030(C). 
8.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
9.  Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
D.  Appeals. The city council of the city of Morro Bay shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

1.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Morro Bay. 
2.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Morro Bay shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
3.  If Section 14.72.050(F)(1) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 14.72.050.

(Ord. No. 564, 11-8-10; Ord. No. 579, 8-14-12)  
14.72.060 - Variance procedure. 
A.  Nature of Variances. The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B.  Appeal Board. 
1.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
a.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
d.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
k.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
2.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 14.72.020) to the applicant; and 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 14.72.020, "Public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 14.72.020) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections (C)(1) though (C)(5) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
7.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 14.72.060(B)(1) and the purposes of this title, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
C.  Conditions for Variances. 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 14.72.040 and 14.72.050 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 14.72.020) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this title. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council will not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
5.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the San Luis Obispo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
6.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency.

(Ord. No. 564, 11-8-10)  
14.75.050 - Compliance with recycling plan. 
A.  Documentation. Prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy for the project, the applicant shall submit to the recycling plan compliance official documentation that the diversion requirement for the project has been met. The diversion requirement shall be that the applicant has diverted at least fifty percent of the total construction and demolition debris generated by the project via reuse or recycling, unless the applicant has been granted an infeasible exemption pursuant to Section 14.75.060 of this chapter, in which case the diversion requirement shall be the maximum feasible diversion rate established by the recycling plan compliance official for the project. This documentation shall include all of the following: 
1.  Receipts from the vendor or facility which collected or received each material showing the actual weight or volume of that material; 
2.  A copy of the previously approved recycling plan for the project adding the actual volume or weight of each material diverted and landfilled; 
3.  Any additional information the applicant believes is relevant to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this chapter. 
B.  Weighing of Wastes. Applicants shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all construction and demolition debris diverted or landfilled are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all construction and demolition debris shall be weighed by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition debris for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose. 
C.  Determination of Compliance. The recycling plan compliance official shall review the information submitted under Section 14.75.050(A) and determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement, as follows: 
1.  Full Compliance. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirements applicable to the project, he or she shall approve the recycling plan and inform the building division that a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
2.  Substantial Compliance. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that the diversion requirement has not been achieved, he or she shall determine on a case-by-case basis whether the applicant has made a good faith effort and is in substantial compliance with this chapter. 
In making this determination, the recycling plan compliance official shall consider the availability of markets for the construction and demolition debris landfilled, the size of the project, and/or the documented efforts of the applicant to divert construction and demolition debris. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter and is in substantial compliance, he or she shall approve the recycling plan and inform the building division that a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
3.  Noncompliance. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that the applicant is not in substantial compliance with this chapter, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by Section 14.75.050(A), then the applicant shall pay a civil penalty as prescribed in Section 14.75.080 prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
D.  Falsification of Records. If the applicant deliberately provides false or misleading data to the city in violation of this chapter, the applicant may be subject to penalties in addition to those specified in Section 14.75.080. In any civil enforcement action, administrative or judicial, the city shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs from an applicant who is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter. 
E.  Final Approval. Prior to final approval by the building division all conditions of this chapter shall be met. 
(Ord. No. 564, 11-8-10)  
14.75.060 - Infeasible exemption. 
A.  Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences unique circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for an exemption at the time that he or she submits the recycling plan required under Section 14.75.030(A) of this chapter. The applicant shall indicate on the recycling plan the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement. 
B.  Meeting with Recycling Plan Compliance Official. The recycling plan compliance official shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. Based on the information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, San Luis Obispo county integrated waste management authority staff or designee, the recycling plan compliance official shall determine whether it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement. 
C.  Granting of Exemption. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the recycling plan submitted by the applicant. The recycling plan compliance official shall return a copy of the recycling plan to the applicant marked "Approved for Infeasible Exemption" and shall notify the building division that the recycling plan has been approved. 
D.  Denial of Exemption. If the recycling plan compliance official determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have thirty days to resubmit a recycling plan form in full compliance with Section 14.75.030(A) of this chapter. If the applicant fails to resubmit the recycling plan, or if the resubmitted recycling plan does not comply with Section 14.75.030(A) of this chapter, the recycling plan compliance official shall deny the recycling plan in accordance with Section 14.75.040(B) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 564, 11-8-10)

15.28.010 - Regulations. 
It is a violation of this chapter for the owner or any other person having charge of any vessel to moor or anchor the same within the waters of Morro Bay except within the areas and at the place or places designated by the harbor director. Any vessel which is moored or anchored at a place not designated for such vessel by the harbor director shall, upon the demand of the harbor director, be forthwith moved to the place or places designated therefor. In the designation of areas and the place or places for the mooring or anchoring of vessels, the harbor director shall be governed by the needs of commerce, the utilization of turning basins for the turning of vessels, the use of channels for the moving and navigation of vessels and the economy of space. Rules and regulations governing the use of mooring areas shall be established by resolution of the city council. Moorings shall be installed, maintained and inspected in accordance with specifications established by the city. 
(Ord. 364 § 1 (part), 1989; Ord. 119 § 1 (part), 1974: prior code § 9406.1)  
15.28.020 - Zone designations. 
The harbor director shall create mooring zones within the anchorage areas of the waters of Morro Bay as designated on U. S. Maritime charts. The established anchorage areas, designated as A-1 and A-2, shall be divided into zones designated as A-1-1 through A-1-5 and A-2. The zones shall be delineated on Diagram 15.28.020 codified in and made a part of this chapter. Each zone shall be further divided into specific mooring and/or anchorage locations by a grid to delineate specific mooring locations. Each mooring location shall be identified by an appropriate numbering system so as to rapidly and positively locate each mooring. Mooring locations shall be arranged, insofar as practicable, so as to locate vessels of similar size in the same area within each mooring zone. A map depicting mooring zones, the city-designated anchorage area and specific mooring locations shall be available to the harbor patrol and to the public for reference. 
(Ord. 364 § 2 (part), 1989: Ord. 119 § 1 (part), 1974: prior code § 9406.2)  
15.28.030 - Marking. 
The harbor director shall establish color codes and numbering markings for each zone and each mooring so as to clearly differentiate zones and moorings within zones. Each mooring shall be painted and numbered so as to be clearly visible from the water. It shall be the responsibility of the harbor director to assure that mooring owners or operators maintain mooring markings in accordance with this section. 
(Ord. 364 § 1 (part), 1989: Ord. 119 § 1 (part), 1974: prior code § 9406.3)  
15.28.040 - Policy. 
It is the policy of the city to lease a portion of Zone A-1-3 for use by the Morro Bay Yacht Club to serve transient vessels and Zone A-1-4 to a commercial mooring operator or operators for installation and rental of individual moorings. Zones A-1-1 through A-1-2 and Zone A-2 shall be reserved for the rental of specific mooring locations to individuals and Zone A-1-5 shall be reserved by the city to provide an anchorage and/or mooring area for transient vessels. 
 
In the event that individual moorings in Zones A-1-1 through A-1-2 and A-2 are not in use for a ten-day period, the city may, at its option, rent these moorings to individuals at the same fee charged at city piers. Rents collected will be credited to the lessees account in the same manner as slip sublease rents collected as detailed in Resolution 09-81. 
The leasing of mooring zones by commercial mooring operators shall be determined by bid in accordance with specifications and conditions established by the city. Mooring locations within the zone or zones reserved for private individuals shall be rented on an individual basis by application to the harbor director. 
The lease or rental term for mooring zones or individual mooring locations shall not exceed a total of one year, which term may be renewable at the option of the city; provided, that if the city at any time requires the movement of the mooring zones, or movement of individual mooring locations due to realignment of the navigable channel, or to perform necessary dredging operations, or for any reason deemed appropriate by the city council, then such lease or rental term shall be terminated. In such case, the city may provide comparable mooring space for the duration of the lease or rental term. This will not be interpreted as interfering with the long-term leases between the city and the Morro Bay Yacht Club or commercial mooring operators. 
Installation, maintenance and inspection of moorings shall be in accordance with and subject to city specifications and conditions. Installation, maintenance and inspection costs shall be at the expense of the commercial mooring operator, the Morro Bay Yacht Club or individual mooring owner. Each mooring shall be inspected for general condition and safety biannually by the chief harbor patrol officer and/or his delegates. This inspection will not be interpreted as causing liability to transfer to the city of Morro Bay. Such inspection is due on the anniversary of the lease. 
In the event that a mooring owned, installed and maintained by a commercial operator, the Morro Bay Yacht Club or a private individual is abandoned, or in the event that rental fees owed to the city are in arrears for sixty days, or in the event that the leasee fails to comply with the inspection and repair requirements within thirty days following the anniversary, then the harbor director may have the mooring removed and the boat stored in drydock, or in any convenient and reasonable manner at the sole cost of the mooring owner. In the event that the mooring owner fails to reimburse the city within thirty days following removal, then the city may sell the mooring to recoup the cost of the mooring removal and administrative costs associated with that removal. The proceeds of that sale are to be deposited in the harbor fund.

The owner thereof shall immediately commence the removal of the obstruction and prosecute the removal diligently to completion and any failure to do so shall be unlawful and constitute an abandonment of such vessel. Whenever any navigable water within the city limits of Morro Bay shall be obstructed or endangered by any vessel or other obstruction, which obstruction or danger has existed for a period of ten days or longer, or whenever the abandonment of a vessel or other obstruction can be legally established in a lesser space of time, the vessel or other obstruction shall be subject to be removed, sold or otherwise disposed of by the city at its discretion without liability for any damage to the owners of the same.

The inspection shall be accomplished by a city of Morro Bay Harbor patrol officer or a qualified marine surveyor acceptable to the city provided that if applicant chooses to have an inspection completed by a marine surveyor, then applicant will bear all costs thereof and provide city a copy of the inspection report. Conditions for issuance of a liveaboard permit are as follows: 
1.  Vessels to be used for liveaboard purposes must be in good material condition not likely to sink or become a menace to navigation and to be of a design suitable for operation on the waters of the Pacific Ocean. All vessels must be currently registered or documented. 
2.  All liveaboard vessels are required to have adequate vessel sanitation facilities on board. 
3.  The proposed liveaboard individual and the vessel to be used for liveaboard purposes must be in compliance with all sections and provisions of this chapter.

No permit will be issued in the name of a partnership (general or limited), corporation, joint venture or other legal entity. A permit for a vessel which is registered, documented or owned by a partnership (general or limited), corporation, joint venture or other legal entity will be issued only to a natural person whose interest in the vessel (whether by virtue of an interest in the partnership, ownership or stock or a corporation or otherwise) is equal to or greater than that of each of the other partners, stockholders, members or associates. An applicant for a permit in Morro Bay for a vessel which is owned by a partnership (general or limited), corporation, joint venture, or other legal entity shall submit for approval by the harbor director, a valid certificate of ownership or valid marine document. Notwithstanding the form of ownership of the vessel, the permit to liveaboard the same within the city of Morro Bay shall not be transferable under any circumstances. If a permittee fails or refuses to notify the harbor director of a change to any of the information contained in the liveaboard permit application within five days from the date of any such change, such failure or refusal shall constitute grounds for revocation of the permit. 
6.  The liveaboard vessel must have a safe and legal berthing location in Morro Bay Harbor other than the A1-5 anchorage area or the city T-Piers. 
7.  The permit will be valid for two fiscal years and the applicant must meet the requirements for permit issuance biennially thereafter or the harbor director shall not reissue the liveaboard permit. Liveaboard vessels which are not in Morro Bay Harbor as provided for in Section 15.040.070 shall not have to meet requirements for permit reissuance until the vessel returns to Morro Bay Harbor. 
8.  The permit will be issued for the vessel, and will state the specific names of the liveaboards authorized to occupy the vessel.

15.40.050 - Termination/revocation of permit. 
A.  Conditions for Termination/Revocation. Liveaboard permits may be revoked for the following reasons: 
1.  Discharge of sewage. 
2.  Violation of any section of this chapter not specifically listed in this section, for a period in excess of thirty days after having been notified to correct the violation. Notice of violation shall be given by first-class mail or personal service or by attachment of said notice in a conspicuous location on the vessel or any combination of the above. Proof of correction of any violation shall be deemed to be the obligation of the permittee, or liveaboard, and shall be to the satisfaction of the harbor director. 
3.  If twice in any twelve-month period the permittee has been found in violation of the terms of this chapter, it shall be evidence of non-compliance with the intent of this chapter to maintain an orderly harbor operation and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the permit. 
4.  In the event that city policy concerning the number of liveaboard permits issued shall change and the number of liveaboard permits shall be reduced, notice of revocation of liveaboard permits shall be given by first-class mail or personal service or by attachment of said notice in a conspicuous location on the vessel or any combination of the above. Since this will require relocation of a personal residence, sixty days notice of termination of the liveaboard permit will be given in this situation. This shall also include requirements established by other agencies whose jurisdiction may be imposed upon the city of Morro Bay. In the event terms and or conditions of maintaining a liveaboard permit are modified by the city council, then those persons holding current liveaboard permits shall have a period of sixty days after adoption of said modifications in which to fully comply with such new regulations. Those permittees with the shortest tenure as a permitted liveaboard will be the first to receive such notice. 
5.  In the event that the liveaboard permit holder moves from the area or no longer resides on the vessel for minimum time periods required or voluntarily terminates liveaboard status. 
6.  Non-payment of fees associated with liveaboard permit or vessel associated with liveaboard permit, service charges, dockage charges or other fees due to the city of Morro Bay for a period in excess of ten days after written notice. Notice shall be given as described in subsection (A)(2) of this section. 
B.  Termination/Revocation Procedure. Upon determining that grounds for revocation of a permit exist, the harbor director shall give written notice of intent to revoke (including the grounds thereof) to the permit holder by first-class mail, personal delivery, by attachment in a conspicuous location on the vessel or any combination of the above, or if the permit holder cannot be located with reasonable effort such notice shall be given to any person aboard the vessel. The revocation shall be effective fifteen days following the giving of such notice except as provided below: 
1.  Appeal. A decision by the harbor director to terminate or revoke a liveaboard permit pursuant to this section shall be appealable to the harbor advisory board. Any such appeal must be filed in writing with the harbor director within ten days of the date of notice of revocation. The revocation shall be stayed while the appeal is pending, unless it is determined by the harbor director that immediate cessation of overnight occupancy of the vessel is necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health or safety. The appeal shall be filed in writing and shall specify all of the grounds for the appeal. The harbor advisory board shall provide the permit holder an opportunity to present evidence on his behalf and to challenge the determination of the harbor director. Formal rules of evidence or procedure need not be followed. If the harbor advisory board is unable to approve any formal motion regarding the appeal after two publicly held hearings on the appeal then the revocation shall become effective three days following the second public meeting.

16.28.020 - Procedures for lot line adjustment. 
A.  The director of public services and city engineer shall have authority to review and approve a tentative lot line adjustment. Said review and approval shall be limited to a determination of whether or not the parcels resulting from the lot line adjustment will conform to local zoning, subdivision map act, and building ordinances. 
B.  The director of public services and city engineer shall not impose conditions or exactions on approval of a lot line adjustment except to conform to the city's zoning and building ordinances, to require the prepayment of real property taxes prior to the approval of the lot line adjustment, or to facilitate the relocation of existing utilities, infrastructure, or easements. 
C.  If the scale and nature of the requested lot line adjustment (e.g., the number of acres and/or parcels) would, in the opinion of the director of public services, raise questions as to consistency with the purpose and intent of the lot line adjustment in relation to the city's general plan and/or zoning code, the director of public services shall have the authority to refer the requested lot line adjustment to the planning commission. 
D.  Upon acceptance of all statements, guarantees, and other documents which are required in conjunction with the lot line adjustment, the director of public services may file a certificate of lot line adjustment, which shall refer to the approved lot line adjustment map, for each parcel affected by the change, and shall cause a deed to be recorded in the office of the county recorder. No record of survey shall be required for a lot line adjustment unless required by Section 8762 of the Business and Professions Code. 
E.  At the option of the property owner, a parcel map delineating the new parcels may be prepared instead of certificates. 
F.  The director's action may be appealed as provided in Chapter 16.72. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.28.030 - Matters to be considered and findings. 
A.  Subject to the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970, the state CEQA guidelines and the city guidelines, the director of public services shall review and consider any applicable environmental documents. 
B.  The lot line adjustment may be approved by the director of public services if he/she finds that the proposed lot line adjustment is consistent with the general plan, and all applicable provisions of the Morro Bay Municipal Code. 
C.  The lot line adjustment may be denied by the director of public services or city engineer on any of the grounds provided by the California Subdivision Map Act or this title. The director of public services and city engineer shall deny approval of the lot line adjustment if he/she makes any of the following findings: 
1.  That the proposed lot line adjustment is inconsistent with the general plan, any applicable specific plan, or any applicable provisions of the Morro Bay Municipal Code; 
2.  That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed type of development; 
3.  That the site is not physically suitable for proposed density of development based on general plan policies; 
4.  That the lot line adjustment is likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and unavoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the director of public services may approve such a lot line adjustment if an environmental impact report was prepared with respect to the project and necessary findings were made pursuant to Section 21081(a), (b) and (c) of CEQA; 
5.  That the lot line adjustment entails significant risk of serious public health problems; 
6.  That the lot line adjustment will conflict with easements acquired by the public at large for access through or use of property within the proposed lot line adjustment. In this connection, the director of public services may approve a lot line adjustment if he/she finds that alternate easements for access or for use will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This section shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is granted to the director of public services to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.

Chapter 16.36 - SUBDIVISION DESIGN 
Sections:  
Article I. - General Considerations 
 
16.36.010 - General considerations. 
The layout of streets and lots within a subdivision shall be consistent with the densities and types of uses authorized by the general plan, specific plans and zoning. The subdivision design shall also recognize the physical conditions of the site, such as slope, soil types, and adjacent land use, which may further limit uses of the property. The subdivider must simultaneously consider such factors as terrain, development objectives, and options available under these regulations in order to design a subdivision which best meets the needs of those who will occupy it as well as the community as a whole. 
The subdivider must also consider the R-1 district is intended to provide a single-family residential area free of disturbing noises, excessive traffic, and hazards created by moving automobiles. The R-1 district is designed to prevent burdens on the public facilities, including sewer, water, electricity and schools by an influx and increase of people to a degree larger than the city's limits, tax base or financial capabilities can reasonably and responsibly accommodate. The R-1 district affords protection from deleterious environmental effects and serves to maintain and protect the existing character of the residential neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007; Ord. No. 539, § 3, 5-27-08)  
Article II. - Lots 
 
16.36.020 - General requirements. 
The design of lots should be based on intended use, topography and access requirements. Lots, which are impractical for, intended uses due to terrain, location of natural features, inadequate access, frontage, or buildable area, or other physical limitations will not be approved. All lots shall abut on an improved street unless approved as a deep lot subdivision by the planning commission, under standards adopted by the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.36.030 - Lot lines. 
A.  Lot lines shall be at the top of slope banks unless otherwise approved by the planning commission. 
B.  Side lot lines should be perpendicular to the street on straight streets, or radial to the street on curved streets, unless another angle would provide better building orientation for solar exposure or more lot area to the south of the likely building site, or unless another lot configuration would better suit the site topography or planned design of the development unless otherwise approved by the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.36.040 - Depth-width relationship. 
Lots with a ratio of depth to width greater than 3:1 shall not be permitted unless there is adequate assurance that deep lot subdivision will not occur or that deep lot subdivision and subsequent development will be accomplished without detriment to adjacent properties. In no case shall the width of a lot be less than forty feet for a standard detached single-family lot. In addition, no lot for a standard single-family lot shall be less than sixty feet in depth. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.36.050 - Minimum lot sizes. 
A.  In general, subdivisions shall be designed to be compatible with existing lots, residences, and zoning in their vicinity. Subdivisions are to be built, to the extent possible, to foster the appearance of neighborhoods with houses facing one another across public streets, cottage designs and garden courts. Minimum lot sizes shall be as established in the tables below for the underlying zoning district for which a subdivision or other action pursuant to this Title is proposed. Except in the area bounded by Kern Avenue, Bradley Avenue, Cabrillo Place, and Main Street, also known as Tract 41 Recorded in Volume 5 of Maps, page 60 filed in the San Luis Obispo county recorders office June 16, 1946, no further subdividing of these lots will be approved in order to preserve the single-family neighborhood character and general consideration discussed in Section 16.36.010.

Chapter 16.40 - COMPACT IN-FILL DEVELOPMENTS 
Sections: 
 
16.40.010 - Intent and purpose. 
The following provisions shall apply to compact in-fill development proposals. A compact in-fill development is defined as any proposal or project which would result in the creation of lots with sizes smaller than those otherwise allowable under the zoning ordinance, and an in-fill development lot is defined as any lot created as a result of such a compact in-fill development project. 
A.  Residential small lot subdivisions, and planned unit developments provide a benefit to the community by expanding the range of choice of housing available. This alternate form provides ownership opportunities for those who may desire less space, less maintenance responsibility, or lower carrying costs than normally would be connected with single-family dwellings. A compact in-fill development project may serve as affordable housing and provide entry into the housing market for a household whose choice has previously been restricted by economic circumstance to the rental market. 
B.  Compact in-fill development is designed and intended to: encourage creativity and innovation in the design of developments; provide for more efficient use of land; permit special consideration of property with outstanding natural or topographical features; facilitate use of the most appropriate construction techniques in the development of land; and, provide for any individual land use not otherwise specified elsewhere in this title. By allowing developers to depart from "cookie cutter" lot forms and setback requirements, more creative use of open space and urban design is possible which allows for diversity in design, size, and style of homes. 
C.  There shall be no requirements for minimum lot width, lot coverage, yards and building setbacks requirements that apply to compact in-fill developments, except as noted below. Dimensional requirements shall be as proposed by the applicant of the compact in-fill development and as approved by the planning commission via a detailed site plan. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.40.020 - Application for conditional use permit. 
A.  The developer of a new compact in-fill development project shall first submit an application for a conditional use permit to the planning division. The application shall include, but not be limited to, the following, in as many copies as the planning division determines to be sufficient for its staff and the planning commission to evaluate the project: 
1.  A complete legal description of the property and a boundary map showing the existing topography of the site and the location of all existing easements, structures and other improvements, and trees over six inches in diameter; and the use of adjoining properties. Any structure within thirty feet of the property line of the proposed development site shall be located. 
2.  Dimensioned schematic development plans consisting of at least a site plan, parking plan, typical floor plan, building elevations showing natural and proposed grades, and a conceptual landscaping plan for the project as a whole. 
3.  Architectural models, photographic simulations, story poles and/or other renderings sufficient to allow the planning commission to fully evaluate the size, scale and bulk of the proposed project, its potential impact on public views and its relationship to an integration with the surrounding neighborhood. 
4.  Such other information which the planning commission or planning division determines is necessary to evaluate the proposed project. 
B.  No application shall be considered unless all the information required by subsections (A)(1) through (A)(3), inclusive, is provided to the planning division. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.40.030 - Development policy, standards, and criteria. 
All compact in-fill development projects shall conform to the requirements of the residential district in which the project is located unless the proposed project utilizes unique residential concepts (such as zero lot line). In addition, all projects shall conform to the following standards, except as noted. In granting a use permit, the planning commission may impose appropriate conditions to assure that projects comply with the standards. 
A.  A compact in-fill development may be established only in multiple-family residential and in qualified commercial districts. 
B.  Minimum Project Size. In order to qualify for a compact in-fill development project, the project site size must be a minimum of eight thousand seven hundred square feet in gross area while meeting the density criteria established in the zoning ordinance for the underlying zoning district. 
C.  Affordability. For projects of five or more lots ten percent or at least one residential unit must be deed restricted for affordability in accordance with the city's affordability standards. 
D.  Overall Design and Site Layout. The following criteria shall be considered in reviewing the overall design and site layout of the project: 
1.  The project should have a comprehensive and integrated design, providing its own open space, off-street parking, and amenities for contemporary living. Open space, walkways, and other areas for people shall be separated from parking areas, driveways, and areas for automobiles; 
2.  Architectural unity and harmony should be achieved both within the project and between the project and the surrounding community so that it does not constitute an adverse disruption to the established fabric of the community; 
3.  The layout of structures and other facilities should effect conservation in street, driveway, curb cut, utility, and other public or quasi-public improvements. Additionally, structures should be designed to minimize, in recognized and published standards, the consumption of natural resources either directly or indirectly; i.e., gas, water, and electricity. 
E.  Lots Configuration. The following criteria shall be considered in reviewing the lot sizes and configuration of the project: 
1.  The size and shape of lots shall be shown on tentative maps and shall be in conformance with city general plan/local coastal plan policies. 
a.  In no case shall any lots in a compact in-fill development subdivision be smaller than two thousand nine hundred square feet in area and forty feet in width for detached single-family lots and one thousand five hundred square feet in area and twenty-five feet in width for attached townhouses. 
2.  Where property is zoned for commercial use, other widths and areas may be permitted at the discretion of the planning commission based on applicable zoning ordinances. 
3.  Corner lots shall have a width sufficient to permit the maintenance of building lines on both front and side, or as set forth in zoning ordinance for the district in which they are situated, and shall also be designed so as to have sufficient sight distance at intersections to meet engineering standards. 
F.  Provision of Private Open Space for Each Unit. Each dwelling unit within a project shall have an appurtenant private open space, such as a patio, deck, or atrium. Such space shall be designed for the sole enjoyment of the unit owner, shall have at least two weatherproofed electrical outlets, and shall have a shape and size that will allow for optimal usable space. Such space shall be at approximately the same level as, and immediately accessible from, a room within the unit.

a.  The proposed space shall be no smaller than six feet in minimum dimension; and 
b.  Yard areas, patios, decks, and ground-level terraces shall have a minimum dimension which is no less than fifty percent of the maximum dimension; and 
c.  The proposed space shall not include walkways, stairs, or landings intended to provide access to any dwelling unit. Those portions of any porch which extend from any door or from the wall extending for one floor on either side of said door to the outer edge of the porch will be considered as "landings" and will not qualify as private open space. Other portions of a porch however may be designated as qualifying private open space if the minimum dimension is equal to or greater than six feet. 
G.  Common Open Space. Each dwelling unit within a project shall have an appurtenant common open space, such as recreational areas, or landscaped areas. Such space shall be designed and governed for the enjoyment of the entire project owners, and shall have a size, shape and topographical condition that will allow for optimal usable space preferably in a single coherent and contiguous area. Such space shall be accessible to all living units in the project, and outside of the required front setbacks. Not including driveways or parking areas and at least fifty percent shall not exceed a ten percent slope.

I.  Lots shall utilize common access when feasible. 
J.  Residential units adjacent to a public street shall be oriented to the public street. 
K.  Individual lots created by the map approved for the entire site shall not be permitted to be reduced in size by subsequent land division. 
L.  Secondary living unit(s) shall not be allowed. 
M.  Utilities, including electric, telephone and cable, along the frontage of, and within the compact in-fill development and along the project frontages shall be installed and/or relocated underground where feasible. 
N.  Guest Parking. One-half guest parking spaces for each unit in the development. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.40.040 - Required findings. 
In approving the establishment of a compact in-fill development, the following findings shall be made: 
A.  Modification of development standards is warranted to promote orderly and harmonious development.

Chapter 16.44 - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS 
Sections: 
 
16.44.010 - Intent and purpose. 
The following provisions shall apply to cluster development proposals. The term conservation is intended to clarify the nature of protecting environmental significant attributes by clustering the development. Cluster development lots are defined as lots with sizes smaller than those established in the zoning ordinance but offers dedicated land for the purposes of open space. 
A.  It is the purpose and intent of conservation subdivisions to preserve open space within residential developments; provide flexibility to allow for creativity in developments; minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical natural resources and historically and culturally significant sites and structures; provide an interconnected network of permanent open space; encourage a more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features; reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation; enhance the community character; permit clustering of houses and structures which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility lines; encourage street design that controls traffic speeds and creates street inter-connectivity; and promote construction of convenient and accessible walking trails and bike paths both within a subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
B.  There shall be no requirements for minimum lot width, lot coverage, yards and building setbacks requirements that apply to cluster developments, except as noted below. Dimensional requirements shall be as proposed by the applicant of the cluster developments and as approved by the planning commission via a detailed site plan.

2.  Dimensioned schematic development plans consisting of at least a site plan, parking plan, typical floor plan, building elevations showing natural and proposed grades, and a conceptual landscaping plan for the project as a whole. 
3.  Such other information which the planning commission or planning division determines is necessary to evaluate the proposed project. 
B.  No application shall be considered unless all the information required by subsections (A)(1) through (A)(3), inclusive, is provided to the planning department. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.44.030 - Applicability of regulations. 
A.  The conservation subdivision option is available for single-family detached townhouse, planned unit development or condominium residential developments. 
B.  The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, adding any bonus density allowed in the zoning district where it is located, at the discretion of the applicant: 
1.  The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
a.  Slopes over thirty percent where at least five thousand square feet is of contiguous area; 
b.  Bodies of open water over five thousand square feet of contiguous area; and 
c.  Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act. 
2.  The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)

G.  Areas greater than fifteen percent of the total open space area that is covered with any impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space. 
H.  At least seventy-five percent of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract, unless a finding can be made that the design meets the intent by creating smaller areas while meeting the overall amount. The open space shall adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, other protected areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected open space. 
I.  The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space. 
J.  Consideration shall be given to the potential impacts secondary living unit(s) may have upon each lot such as parking, compatibility, and lot coverage. 
(Ord. No. 522, § 3, 3-12-2007)  
16.44.060 - Required findings. 
In approving the establishment of a conservation subdivision, the following findings shall be made: 
A.  Modification of development standards is warranted to promote orderly and harmonious development. 
B.  Modification of development standards will enhance the opportunity to best utilize special characteristics of an area and will have a beneficial effect on the area. 
C.

Chapter 16.48 - CONDOMINIUMS AND CONVERSIONS 
Sections: 
 
16.48.010 - Purpose and intent. 
Condominiums, community apartments and stock cooperatives provide for ownership of separate dwellings, or equity coupled with a right of exclusive occupancy, as well as common areas within multiple-family housing normally managed and maintained by an owner's association. This mix of individual and common ownership and the potential problems of converting existing apartments make special regulations necessary. 
The city has determined that condominiums differ from apartments in some respects and, for the benefit of public health, safety and welfare; the conversion of such projects should be treated differently from apartments. 
These regulations are intended to: 
A.  Establish requirements and procedures for the conversion of existing rental housing to residential condominiums and other forms of occupant housing. 
B.  Provide for compliance with the land use element and housing element of the city's general plan. 
C.  Assure that purchasers of converted apartments are aware of the condition of the structure, which is offered for purchase. 
D.  Provide design and property improvement standards for condominium/conversion projects. 
E.  Maintain a healthy inventory of rental housing suitable for persons of low and moderate income.

It is the intent of the city that it shall maintain the maximum amount of prime agricultural land in agricultural production to assure the protection of the area's agricultural economy, and to facilitate and encourage the provision of decent, affordable housing for farm workers by not requiring a conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance for farmworker housing that is not required of any other agricultural activity in the agriculture (AG) zone, except that a coastal development permit is required consistent with the local coastal program. In addition, it is the city's intent that all nonprime agricultural land within the city suitable for agricultural use shall not be converted to nonagricultural uses unless: 
1.  Continued or renewed agricultural use is not feasible; or 
2.  Such conversion would preserve prime agricultural land or concentrate development consistent with Public Resources Code, Section 30250. 
B.  Special Agricultural Standards. 
1.  Temporary Produce Stands. Temporary seasonal stalls or stands not greater than one thousand square feet in area for the sale of produce, hay or feed, fifty percent of which is grown on-site or on sites which are leased or owned by the same tenant/owner; may be permitted subject to a temporary use permit. Said use shall provide adequate access and parking. 
2.  Special Restrictions on Nonagricultural Use of Prime Agricultural Use of Prime Agricultural Land. The following special restrictions on uses shall apply to prime agricultural land: 
a.  Commercial Uses. Commercial recreation, visitor-serving commercial and general commercial uses shall be prohibited on prime agricultural lands. 
b.  Other Uses. All other uses which are conditionally permitted in the AG district in accordance with subsection B of this section may be permitted on prime agricultural lands only if the following findings are made by the planning commission: 
i.  No Alternative Building Site. That no alternative building site exists except on prime agricultural lands; and 
ii.  Amount of Conversion Minimized. That the least amount of prime agricultural land possible will be converted to these conditionally permitted uses; and 
iii.  No Use Conflicts. That the conditionally permitted uses will not conflict with surrounding agricultural land and uses. 
3.  Expressly Prohibited Uses. The following uses are expressly prohibited in the AG zone; hog raising; commercial dairies; kennels; rabbit and chicken ranching involving more than twelve animals, unless a special permit is obtained from the city council according to Title 7 of the Morro Bay Municipal Code; and any use which will degrade the quality of the groundwater basin. 
4.  Reduced Lot Size. Minimum lot sizes may be reduced only if a covenant, restriction or similar document is recorded which limit future uses of the lots to open space, agriculture or uses of the lots to open space, agriculture or uses or structures accessory to agriculture provided, however, that the minimum lot area shall in no case be less than twenty thousand square feet and the lots are clustered to maintain agricultural feasibility or provide a coordinated open space area. 
5.  Maximum Density for Animals. Not more than four cattle or horses per acre, nor more than eight sheep or goats per acre may be kept in the AG district, provided however that the greater densities may be permitted on a temporary basis, not to exceed a period of forty-five days. When calculating this density, all animals shall be counted and any eight sheep or goats shall be considered equivalent to four cattle or horses; i.e., this section shall not be construed to mean eight sheep or goats may be permitted in addition to four horses per acre. 
6.  Performance Standards. All other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, no development shall be permitted which does not meet the following standards: 
a.  Environmentally Sensitive Habitats and Scenic Resources. New roads of other land disturbance and new uses shall not adversely impact environmentally sensitive habitat areas and shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse impacts on scenic resources, the rural character of the site and adjacent agricultural operations; 
b.  Barns, Corrals, and Other Animal Enclosures. Barns, corrals and other animal enclosures shall be located on-site in accordance with Title 7 of the Morro Bay Municipal Code; 
c.  Grading for Agricultural Roads. Grading for all agricultural roads shall conform to the applicable requirements as contained in Title 14; 
d.  Maintenance. Corrals, pens, feed areas, paddocks, stables and permanently fenced pasture are to be maintained in a neat and sanitary manner and free from litter and garbage.

A.  Purpose. 
1.  The single-family residential (R-1) district is intended to be applied to existing single-family residential areas of the city to provide for housing which is consistent and harmonious with existing development and to underdeveloped areas of the city in which topography, access, services, utilities and general conditions make the area suitable and desirable for single-family home development. 
2.  The purpose is to stabilize and maintain the residential character of the R-1 district and to ensure the maintenance of the maximum amenities for family living commensurate with the densities of population specified and to ensure that the districts will be free of excessive traffic and other uses causing congestion, noise, confusion and interference in the pattern of family living. 
B.  Special Standards. 
1.  In the R-1 district, if located on one-half acre or greater, the number of single-family residential units allowed is one per lot or the number of units allowed in accordance with the density range of the land use designation contained in the general plan and coastal land use plan. The maximum number of residential units shall not exceed four per lot. 
2.  If more than one single-family residence is located on a lot in the R-1 district, any residential unit that has not been authorized as a secondary dwelling in accordance with state and local regulations, shall not be used in violation of the Subdivision Map Act.

17.24.080 - Coastal resource residential (CRR) district. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the coastal resource residential (CRR) district is to provide for the residential uses that are environmentally compatible with protection of coastal resources of local and statewide significance by limiting densities and intensity of residential development and restricting the range of ancillary uses. Large minimum lot sizes are required to in order to minimize overall levels of activity that could adversely impact sensitive coastal resources. Clustered development is encouraged where it will result in lesser levels of impact. This category is appropriate in areas adjacent to the designated ESH zones and in areas providing traditional public views to and along the shoreline. 
B.  Special CRR Zone Standards. 
1.  Height Limits in View Corridors. The height limit for structures within the public viewshed corridors defined in the LCP land use plan shall be four feet. 
2.  Special Clustered Development Standards, Cloisters Area. 
a.  Uses. Permitted uses, conditionally permitted use, minimum front yard, corner lot exterior side yard, minimum rear yard and landscaping remain as set forth in the CRR table. 
b.  Alternative Standards. For clustered residential development, the following alternative standards shall apply: 
i.  Height Limit of Structures. 
(A)  Structures shall be limited to a single-story in height and shall not exceed fourteen feet in height on the area north of the view corridor. 
(B)  In the area of Tract 1996 south of the view corridor, lots 59 through 88 and lots 46, 47, and 48 shall be limited to single-story structures, not to exceed 14 feet above finished grade. For the remaining lots with second stories, the second story shall be limited to fifty percent of the foot print of the principal structure. 
(C)  No structure in the south cluster (lots 46 through 120) shall exceed twenty-five feet in height above finished grade. Further, on lots 49 through 58, 89, 90, 93, 95, 101, 104, 108, 110, 112, 113, 115, 116, 118, 119, and 120 no structure shall exceed twenty-five feet in height above finished grade; on lots 91, 92, 94, 96 through 100, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107, 109, 111, 114, and 117 no structure shall exceed seventeen feet in height above finished grade; and on lots 46, 47, 48, and 59 through 88 no structure shall exceed fourteen feet in height above finished grade. 
(D)  If Tract 1996 should expire, height limits of any future development proposed for this site shall comply with the height limits established by the local coastal program land use plan and the general plan. 
(E)  The above mentioned height limits shall be measured from finished grade; provided however, finished grade shall only exceed existing natural grade by the minimum fill necessary to meet floodplain elevation requirements and tract drainage, engineering, and utility design criteria as determined by the city engineer in his sole discretion. Any grading plan for the site shall be reviewed to ensure that the above criteria is met as determined by the city engineer in his sole discretion. 
ii.  Minimum building site: Six thousand square feet for interior lots and seven thousand square feet of corner lots. 
iii.  Maximum lot coverage: All structures, forty-five percent, unless otherwise allowed pursuant to the LCP land use plan standards. 
iv.  Minimum lot width: Fifty feet or thirty-five on a cul-de-sac at property line.

17.24.110 - Mixed commercial/residential (MCR) district. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the mixed commercial/residential (MCR) district and the North Main Street specific plan (see Chapter 17.40) is as follows: 
1.  To allow and regulate a mix of compatible commercial uses with residential uses in districts where a strip commercial area is in close proximity to a residential neighborhood; 
2.  To broaden the range of commercial market opportunities; 
3.  To provide a review procedure to protect the residential neighborhood from unsafe or unhealthy conditions. 
B.  Special Standards. 
1.  General. The MCR zone allows uses which are found to be similar and consistent with the general plan and local coastal plan as those found within the C-1 and C-2 districts, mixed commercial and residential uses in any proportion, or exclusive residential use. The R-1 density standards shall apply to residential development in the MCR district unless designated with the R-2, R-3 or R-4 suffix. 
2.  Regular or Minor Conditional Use Permit Required. All uses in the MCR district are conditionally permitted only; that is, no new change in use shall be allowed without first obtaining a minor use permit approved by the zoning administrator; or a regular conditional use permit from the planning commission pursuant to Chapter 17.60. 
3.  Residential Uses. Residential uses may be permitted in the MCR zone in conjunction with an approved office or commercial use in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Residential uses, without accompanying commercial development as allowed in the R-1 zone, may be permitted according to the applicable development standards of this plan. Designation of the MCR zone with an R-1, R-2, R-3 or R-4 suffix will permit residential development according to the designated density and applicable development standards of this plan. 
4.  Visitor Serving Commercial. Bed and breakfast uses as defined in Section 17.12.059 with ancillary facilities may be permitted in the CV-S zone or MCR zone with a conditional use permit. The scale, layout and architectural treatment shall be compatible with and shall reflect that of a residential neighborhood. 
5.  Service and Retail Commercial. All uses in the C-1 and C-2 zones inclusive may be permitted in the MCR zone with either minor or regular conditional use permit, subject to the development standards of this plan. 
6.  Special Development Standards. In addition to the findings required by Chapter 17.60, the zoning administration and the planning commission must find that the following development standards have been met before approving a minor or regular use permit for any use in the MCR district. 
a.  Mixed Uses. In any use (i.e., commercial and residential) project, the project in terms of specific types of uses, their locations and the development layout and design shall provide for compatibility among the uses. Features such as building entrances and open parking shall be differentiated to the extent practical between residential and commercial uses on the same site. Adequate private and common open space generally in conformance with standards set forth in Chapter 17.49 of this title shall be provided for all residences. 
b.  Side and Rear Yard Setbacks. The minimum side and rear yard setback shall be five feet. All setbacks shall be landscaped. Larger setbacks may be required by the planning commission if deemed necessary to provide an adequate buffer between uses. 
c.  Landscaping in Front Yard and Street Side Yard. A minimum of five feet of landscaped area shall be provided in front of any building or parking lot facing a public street. Where a developer elects Main Street realignment, the front yard setback will be reduced accordingly and the developer shall be responsible for landscaping the realignment island.

Public utility facilities, including but not limited to public parking lots, roads, bridges, pedestrian trails, bikeways, communications equipment building, water wells, substations, switching stations, pipelines, transmission lines, and similar utility uses provided, however, that new or expanded electrical generating facilities or structures associated with such facilities in a zoning district with a "PD" suffix shall be governed by the regulations contained in Section 17.40.030, all other provisions of this section notwithstanding. 
1.  Within the Coastal Zone. In addition to making the findings required in Section 7.60.030 the planning commission/city council shall consider the following before approving a special use permit for new pipelines and electric transmission lines: 
a.  Routes of All New Lines. The routes of all new lines shall, to the maximum extent feasible, avoid important coastal resources such as recreation and environmentally sensitive areas. Where such resources cannot be avoided, and will be adversely affected, the planning commission/city council shall require appropriate mitigation measures. These measures may include, but are not limited to precluding construction during peak visitor seasons in recreational areas, precluding construction during nesting or breeding seasons in sensitive habitat areas, the vegetation of graded areas, the undergrounding of utility facilities, the preparation of an oil spill contingency plan for new pipelines, restrictions of the use of herbicides, and various erosion control measures (as appropriate); 
b.  Electric Distribution and Communications Lines. All new electric distribution and communications lines shall be installed and maintained underground, except where it is environmentally or economically unfeasible to do so. 
2.  Exemptions. The following utility facilities shall not be required to obtain a special use or coastal development permit: those facilities exempted from acquiring coastal development permits under Government Code Section 30610(d) and (f) shall be as defined by the State Coastal Zone Conservation Commission's interpretive guidelines (adopted September 5, 1978) and subsequent revisions thereto. 
Q.  Visitor-Serving Commercial and Recreation Uses in Certain Areas. The base zoning district notwithstanding, visitor-serving commercial and recreation uses, which shall include all uses permitted or conditionally permitted in the C-VS district, may be permitted subject to obtaining a special use permit, in the area labeled "the Embarcadero" in the coastal land use plan/coastal element and defined as the area between Beach Street on the north, Olive Street on the south, Main Street on the east and the waterfront on the west; 
R.  Desalinization plants; 
S.  Compatible Multiple Use of Public School Sites and Facilities. The special use permit is to provide for certain buildings and structures pursuant to provisions of the California Education Code (Section 39500 and its successors) which permits joint occupancy of buildings for certain uses and users which are of a scale and intensity compatible with the public school and its neighborhood (i.e. school attendance area). It is further the purpose of the permit to maintain the continued operation of neighborhood schools, including public recreational uses at the schools, while allowing for the joint occupancy of vacant school property and buildings during periods of less than capacity enrollment. 
1.  Permitted uses, subject to the securing of a special use permit: 
a.  Parochial and private schools and colleges; 
b.  Activities of religious organizations including regular church services;

2.  Special Use Permit—Issuance. In addition to the provisions of Section 17.30.030 the special use permit for joint school use shall receive final approval by the city council at a duly noticed public hearing. The planning commission shall first consider the permit at a public hearing and forward their report and recommendation to the council. 
3.  Special Use Permit—Application. Joint occupancy of any school shall not be permitted until a school utilization plan has been approved by the city council pursuant to the permit provisions of this section. (The limitation shall not apply to specific uses lawfully established prior to the effective date of Ord. 204. Any new joint occupancies shall only be permitted after the approval of a school utilization plan.) Such a school utilization plan shall provide for at least the following: 
a.  Proposed Amount, Use and Location of Space. A site plan delineating the proposed amount, use and location of space for both school and nonschool uses. The plan shall identify access and parking as related to all existing and proposed uses; 
b.  List of Uses. A list of uses to be accommodated on the site. Each use shall be described in sufficient detail as to permit a clear understanding of any potential site and neighborhood impacts; 
c.  Enrollment Projection. A minimum five-year school enrollment projection, and a statement of the time period the joint occupancy program for the school shall be in effect; 
d.  Other Information. Such other information as may be required by the planning commission or city council; 
e.  Change to the Approved Site Plan or List of Allowed Uses. Once such a utilization plan has been approved by the city council, no additional special use permit shall be required unless a change is proposed to the approved site plan or list of allowed uses. However, each specific lease shall be reviewed and certified by the director as conforming with the provisions of the school utilization plan. In addition, each approved school utilization plan shall be reviewed by the planning commission biannually at a fully noticed public hearing to insure that the plan and joint occupancy continue to meet the objectives of this section. 
4.  Special Use Permit—General Provisions. 
a.  Separation. It shall be the responsibility of the school district to provide for and insure acceptable separation between the school and nonschool use dependent upon such conditions as locations, shared facilities and intensity of proposed nonschool use. 
b.  Off-Street Parking and Loading Space. Off-street parking and loading space shall be provided in accordance with Section 17.44.020C. 
c.  Joint Occupancies. All joint occupancies shall be designed and conducted to minimize noise, traffic congestion, safety hazards, or any other condition that could significantly affect public health, safety or welfare. 
d.  Commercial Uses. As a general rule, no more than fifty percent of the total floor area of any school should be used for commercial uses. This is a guideline based on the belief that a higher non- school utilization would mean that public education is no longer the primary use of the school. A school utilization plan exceeding the fifty percent guidelines may be approved only if the city council finds that such a plan is consistent with the purposes and objectives stated in this section. 
e.  Accordance With Other Provisions. In addition to all of the preceding requirements, all uses of school facilities and buildings shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Morro Bay Municipal Code or any other law or ordinance of the city.

The planning commission may require similar insurance provisions for vendors not located on lease sites as deemed necessary. 
f.  Sublease Agreement. On city-administered property (lease sites), the vendor shall submit a sublease agreement with the lessee and lease amendment agreement for city approval, as necessary. Such lease operations shall be permitted lease use or use amendment as requested. All retail sales resulting from lease operations are subject to percentages of gross sales when calculating lease rent payments on certain city leases. 
g.  Daily Close of Business. All vending apparatus shall be removed at the close of business daily unless otherwise specified by the planning commission. 
h.  Roving. Vendors shall be at designated locations; "roving" (i.e., moving from one location to another) shall not be permitted. 
i.  Public Rights-of-Way. Vendors are precluded from operations on all public rights-of-way. A vendor, therefore, is restricted to private or city-leased property.

Chapter 17.40 - SPECIAL TREATMENT OVERLAY AND COMBINING DISTRICTS AND SPECIFIC PLANS 
Sections: 
 
17.40.010 - Application of regulations. 
The planned development (PD), environmentally sensitive habitat (ESH), special treatment (S), mobilehome (M), interim (I), and specific plan (SP) districts are overlay zones which apply special standards to primary zoning districts. In any primary district which is combined with a "PD," "ESH," "S," "M," "I," "SP" or special treatment combining district, and in mixed use areas where a primary and secondary district are combined, this chapter shall apply in addition to those uses and regulations specified for such districts; provided, however, in the event of a conflict with the regulations applicable, the provisions of this chapter shall govern and shall take precedence over the standards and uses specified in the primary zone. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.40.020 - Scope. 
These districts may be used to require special treatment or regulations such as the application of special design criteria including architectural, structural, physical, environmental, and visual characteristics for new development in unique areas of the city. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.40.030 - Planned development, (PD) overlay zone. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the planned development (PD) overlay zone, is to provide for detailed and substantial analysis of development on parcels which, because of location, size or public ownership, warrant special review. This overlay zone is also intended to allow for the modification of or exemption from the development standards of the primary zone which would otherwise apply if such action would result in better design or other public benefit. 
B.  Chapter Application. The requirements and procedures contained in this chapter shall apply to all properties which have, in addition to a primary or base zone district, the planned development (PD) overlay zone, unless otherwise provided in this chapter. 
C.  Permitted Uses. Subject to the granting of a conditional use permit for a conceptual and/or a precise plan of development: 
1.  Any principal or conditional use which is allowed by the primary zoning district is a permitted use; 
2.  Community housing projects as defined in Chapter 17.49, may be permitted in PD overlay residential zones. The provisions of that chapter shall, also apply to the review of such PD overlay zone projects. 
D.  General Development Standards.

6.  Other Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas. The following are conditionally permitted: all other resource-dependent uses which do not significantly degrade the habitat values. 
D.  Special ESH Zone Standards. 
1.  General Application and Requirement for Uses. The ESH overlay zone shall be applied to all environmentally sensitive habitat areas and to buffers around such habitat areas necessary to ensure continued protection of the habitat values. 
2.  Expressly Prohibited Uses. 
a.  Significant Disruption. No uses which will cause significant disruption to the ecosystem or habitat values shall be permitted. 
b.  Vehicular Traffic. Vehicular traffic shall be prohibited on wetlands and dune areas (this does not apply to previously filled wetlands landward of an established bulkhead or revetment) 
c.  Spoil Disposal. Further dredge spoil disposal shall be prohibited on the sand spit. 
3.  Types of Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas. A number of types of environmentally sensitive habitat areas exist within the city. The nature of these ecosystems and their susceptibility to possible degradation by different human activities varies among habitat types. Uses acceptable in one type of habitat area may be unacceptable in a more sensitive one. Therefore, environmentally sensitive habitat areas must be classified into one of the following types before determining permitted uses: 
a.  Wetlands. Lands which may be covered periodically or permanently with shallow water, including saltwater marshes, freshwater marshes, open or closed brackish water marshes, swamps, mudflats and fens. 
b.  Estuary. A coastal water body usually semi-enclosed by land, but which has open, partially obstructed, or intermittent exchange with the ocean and in which ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. The salinity may be periodically increased above the open ocean by evaporation. In general, the boundary between "wetland" and "estuary" is the time of extreme low water; 
c.  Sand Dunes, Sandspit. "Sand dunes" are mounds of sand deposited by wind and frequently vegetated by characteristic plant species. The "sandspit" is that geographic portion of the city surrounded on three sides by water and separating Morro Bay from the open ocean; much of the spit is covered by sand dunes; 
d.  Stream Corridors (Streams and Adjacent Riparian Habitats). A "stream" is a natural water course as designated on the most recently published United States Geological Survey map, or any well-defined channel with distinguishable bed and bank that shows evidence of having contained flowing water as indicated by scour or deposit of rock, sand, gravel, soil or debris. A "riparian habitat" is an area characterized by an association of plant species which grow adjacent to freshwater watercourses, including perennial and intermittent streams, lakes and other bodies of fresh water; 
e.  Restricted Areas. Those habitats which have resources so environmentally sensitive that even passive recreational uses must be prohibited; 
f.  Other. All other environmentally sensitive habitat areas designated on the zoning map not herein defined. The zoning map indicates the location of known environmentally sensitive habitat areas by type; additional areas may be added to this map as further information is developed related to sensitive habitats in the city. 
4.  Buffers Required, General. The following minimum buffers shall be applied to environmentally sensitive habitat areas, except as provided elsewhere in this chapter. 
a.  Wetlands. The minimum buffer surrounding wetlands shall be one hundred feet; review area: minimum of two hundred fifty feet. 
b.  Streams. The minimum buffer for streams shall be one hundred feet in non-urban areas and fifty feet in urban areas. 
c.  Sand Dunes. The minimum buffer for sand dunes shall be one hundred feet, in non-urban areas and fifty feet in urban areas. 
d.  Other. The minimum buffer for estuaries, restricted areas and all other environmentally sensitive habitat areas shall be one hundred feet. 
5.  Greater Buffers Required. In some habitat areas, a buffer greater than that called for in Section 17.40.040(D)(4) shall be required if an initial study and/or environmental impact report prepared according to the California Environmental Quality Act indicates that such buffers are necessary for the protection of the habitat values. 
6.  Reducing Buffers. 
a.  In all cases, except for wetlands, buffers may be reduced in accordance with the following standards if the application of the buffer specified in Section 17.40.040(D)(4) on a previously subdivided parcel would render that subdivided parcel unusable for its designated use. 
b.  Accommodation of Designated Use. Buffers may be reduced only to the point where the designated use is accommodated but in no case shall it be less than fifty percent of the width called for in Section 17.40.040(D)(4). Said reduction in setbacks may be permitted by the city, as provided above, only after consultation with the California Department of Fish and Game; the applicant shall implement as part of the development all mitigation measures deemed necessary for habitat protection after such consultation. All permitted reductions in buffer areas shall be found consistent with Policies 11.01, 11.05, 11.06 and 11.14 of the coastal land use plan. 
7.  Uses in Buffer Area. 
a.  General. The uses permitted in buffers shall generally be limited to those permitted in the adjacent habitat area. 
b.  Permanent Structures. No permanent structures shall be permitted within buffer areas except for those of a minor nature such as: 
i.  In residential areas: 
(A)  Fences; 
(B)  Eaves; 
ii.  In other districts: 
(A)  At grade improvements for pedestrian or equestrian trails; 
(B)  Instructional or informational signs; 
(C)  Designated observation areas, or other public access or educational facilities; 
(D)  Fences; 
(E)  Eaves; 
Applications for all such improvements shall be submitted to the Department of Fish and Game for review and comment before the issuance of a coastal development permit. 
8.  Subdivisions Prohibited. The further subdivision of any ESH area shall be prohibited except where the sensitive habitat area is to be transferred in fee to a public agency for a wildlife refuge or for a wildlife management area. 
9.  Performance Standards. All other sections of this chapter notwithstanding, no uses shall be permitted unless the following performance standards are met, as applicable, in new developments: 
a.  Significant Adverse Effects. New development shall not result in significant adverse effects upon habitat values. 
b.  Revegetation. Where permitted uses require the removal of riparian or dune related plant species, such removal shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary and revegetation with: 
i.  Native vegetation in the habitat areas of rare or endangered species; or 
ii.  Native, drought-tolerant plants where determined feasible and approved by the city. All such proposals calling for removal of vegetation and subsequent revegetation shall be submitted to the Department of Fish and Game for review and comment. 
c.  Walkways, Trails and Similar Uses. Walkways, bicycle trails, overlooks and other structures for nature study and passive recreational use shall be designed to minimize the disturbance of wildlife and vegetation. For example, in dune areas elevated walkways may be required. 
d.  Culverts, Ponds. Any culverts or ponds created as part of a permitted use shall be sited and designed to insure against the risk of flood damage to adjacent properties. 
e.  Diking, Dredging, Filling. Any permitted diking, dredging or filling activities in wetlands and estuaries shall maintain or enhance functional capacity of the habitat. 
f.  Breeding and Nesting Season Restrictions. On dune habitats, all permitted uses shall be regulated to protect critical bird habitats during the breeding and nesting seasons. Any mitigation measures deemed necessary after consultation with the Department of Fish and Game, including but not limited to access controls and noise abatement, shall be implemented. 
g.  Other Agency Permits. Prior to any construction, alteration or other improvement in areas designated as wetlands or estuaries the following shall be presented to the city: 
i.  404 Permit. A Section 404 permit (or its equivalent successor) from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
ii.  Letter from CDFG. A letter from the California State Department of Fish and Game stating compliance with Sections 1601 and 1603 (or their equivalent successors) of the State Fish and Game Code. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)

G.  S.4 Special Design Criteria Overlay Zone. In order to maintain and enhance the character and visual quality of these areas, special design review has been found to be necessary. Applications for development shall include (as appropriate) submittal of architectural, landscaping, lighting, signing and viewshed plans for review and approval. 
H.  S.5 Precise Plan Areas Overlay Zone. Certain areas of the waterfront have been deemed to require special review due to their sensitive nature. For development permitted in an S.5 overlay zone, a precise plan in accordance with LUP policies 7.06 or 7.07 and 7.08 shall be required. 
I.  S.6 Residential Protection Overlay Zone. The intent of this overlay zone is to afford reasonable protection in case of accidental destruction for various residential uses which were made nonconforming when the city's LCP was adopted, subject to certain limitations. In the S.6 overlay zone, residential uses which were constructed prior to October 1984 shall be considered conforming uses regardless of the base zoning district and subject to the following limitations: 
1.  Length of Conforming Status. The conforming status of such residential uses extended by this overlay zone shall run for fifty years from the date of original construction of the building. After fifty years from date of original construction, such uses shall be considered legal, but nonconforming uses, if they do not conform to the base zoning district. Such uses may continue, but shall be subject to all applicable provisions of Chapter 17.56 regarding nonconforming uses. 
2.  Additions. No addition to a residence in the S.6 overlay zone which is otherwise nonconforming to the base zone district and exceeding twenty-five percent of the existing floor area may be permitted unless a conditional use permit is obtained pursuant to Chapter 17.60. 
J.  Procedure for Special Treatment Overlay Zones. Depending on the primary zone in effect, plans, drawings, illustrations and other material necessary to support the proposal for improvement and to identify the development in relation to the requirements shall be submitted to the director, who shall review these plans and forward his recommendation to the planning commission for action. The planning commission shall thereafter approve, conditionally approve or disapprove said plans. Approval of the planning commission shall constitute authority for the issuance of a permit. 
(Ord. 483 § 1, 2000: Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.40.070 - Combining mixed use overlay zone. 
A.  Purpose of Combining Mixed Use Overlay Zone. The local coastal plan has designated certain areas of the city as mixed use designation and shall be addressed for development of each of these areas. 
B.  Mixed Use Overlay Zone Standards. In those areas of the city where the local coastal land use plan has indicated that combinations of different, but compatible, uses may be appropriate, two or more zoning districts may be applied to the same property. In such cases, new developments may be permitted in accordance with the zoning districts and with the following provisions: 
1.  In mixed use areas combining two or more commercial designations, the area shall be devoted to approximately equal areas of the uses permitted in the respective commercial designations. 
2.  In mixed use areas combining commercial and residential designations, the commercial district shall be the primary district and at least fifty percent of the gross floor area of the project shall be devoted to commercial or office uses. An exception is for those areas in which the coastal land use plan text specifically describes the mixed use relationship that shall be allowed. 
3.  Residential uses may be permitted in conjunction with the primary use, and shall be located on upper stories or to the rear of the primary use, but may be placed in separate buildings as part of an overall integrated plan for large parcels. 
4.  All residential uses shall be subject to a conditional use permit as provided in Chapter 17.60 of this title. The following criteria shall be considered in review of conditional use permit applications for such developments: 
a.  Provisions of private outdoor space for residences; 
b.  Provisions of separate access for residences; 
c.  Compatibility of the commercial use component with the residential use and the surrounding neighborhood. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.40.080 - Interim use (I) overlay zone. 
A.  Purpose. Certain properties being held for future use may be approved for interim uses to allow for proper utilization of the land. 
B.  Uses Allowed with Interim Use Permits. The following uses may be permitted on all M-1 or M-2 industrial-zoned properties which are also designated in the coastal land use plan/coastal element as appropriate for interim uses, on a temporary basis until the properties are needed for their principally permitted uses, and subject to the issuance of an interim use permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
1.  Commercial Fishing and Boating Industries. Uses serving the needs of the commercial fishing and boating industries, including but not limited to temporary boat storage and repair, and ancillary uses for same; and 
2.  Temporary Visitor-Serving or Recreation. Temporary visitor-serving or recreation uses, including but not limited to paths, R-V parks, camping facilities and ancillary uses for same, playground, exercise courses, restrooms, drinking fountains, sewage dump stations, and parking. 
3.  Conditions Required. The planning commission may grant an interim use permit only if the following conditions are met: 
a.  The proposed uses is limited to relocatable, nonpermanent structures, or existing structures; and 
b.  The proposed use is subordinate to the character of the visual setting; and 
c.  The non-owner applicant agrees to remove the interim use after notice from the property owners that the site is necessary for the primary use in the base zoning district. 
C.  Term Of Interim Permit. The planning commission shall set such term for the interim use permit as deemed appropriate after considering the level of improvements of the interim use and anticipated demand for the primary uses. An applicant may apply for renewal of an interim use permit. For the industrially zoned, city-owned property south of Atascadero Road, an interim use permit may be granted for the following uses only, subject to short term leases of five to ten years, or until such time as the property is needed for its primary permitted use: commercial fishing and boating facilities, RV parks, overflow camping facilities, temporary boat storage and repair and ancillary uses for the same. 
D.  Applicability To ESH. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any area which has been designated as an environmentally sensitive habitat (ESH) area by the city. 
E.  Screening and Landscaping. In addition to the permit application materials required by Section 17.60.020, the applicant shall also submit a screening and landscaping plan for approval by the planning commission. All parking areas and frontage on public rights-of-way shall be screened and landscaped so as to enhance viewsheds from such rights-of-ways. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.40.100 - Beach Street Area specific plan (SP-BS). 
A.  Beach Street Area Specific Plan Adopted. The zoning regulations and standards for that part of the city illustrated in Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter, shall be the "Beach Street Area Specific Plan" which is established therefore and which provides for regulated development in accordance with the purpose, rationale and objectives set out herein; said specific plan is incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety. 
B.  Base Zoning Districts. The base zoning districts for each of the areas of the Beach Street Area specific plan are as shown on Figure 17.40.100(2), codified at the end of this chapter. 
Uses may be permitted in accordance with the standards prescribed in the base zones, provided however that they also meet all other applicable regulations of the Beach Street Area specific plan and Title 17. 
C.  PD Overlay Zone. A PD overlay zone, as contained in Section 17.40.030, is applied to all land within the Beach Street Area specific plan boundaries. All new uses and development shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedures contained in said chapter and may be approved only if all required findings are made in accordance with said chapter. 
D.  Additional Regulations. The following subsections prescribe additional regulations which shall be applied to particular subareas within the Beach Street Area specific plan boundaries as illustrated on Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter. Any new development or use shall comply with the additional regulations applied to the subarea in which it is found, as well as to the requirements of the applicable base zone and PD overlay zone. In instances where the particular regulations in these sections conflict with those of the base zone, the particular regulations for the subarea shall apply. 
E.  Area A. In addition to those of the base zone and the PD overlay zone, the following development regulations and standards shall apply to the portion of the Beach Street Area specific plan labeled Area A on Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter. 
1.  Height Limit. No portion of any building shall exceed the height of the "bluff top," as defined in Chapter 17.12, except for view platforms; provided, however, that developments which include coordinated structures or other elements below the bluff may be permitted to be built on the bluff face in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 17.45. 
2.  Public View Access. 
a.  New Development or Additions. For new development or additions of ten percent or greater to the floor area of existing buildings, a fee of two dollars per linear foot of property fronting along the toe of the bluff or one hundred dollars, whichever is greater, shall be paid to the city for the purpose of designing, construction and/or maintaining a public view deck to be constructed on Surf Street or such other location deemed appropriate by the city. 
b.  Fee Charged In-Lieu. The fee is charged in-lieu of requiring an offer of dedication for a public accessway along the bluff. Unless an offer of dedication is required for every blufftop property, the opportunity for a coordinated accessway is lost; therefore, in lieu of such a requirement for an offer of dedication on all blufftop properties, all such properties shall pay the fee at the time of new development or redevelopment as a contribution toward the construction of the single public view deck. 
c.  In-Lieu Fee Uses. The fee shall be either placed in a special fund used exclusively for the design, construction, repair or maintenance of facilities contained in the approved public view access plan or may be paid to the general fund as reimbursement for previously incurred costs for the design, construction, repair or maintenance of such facilities. 
3.  Light and Glare. 
a.  Exterior Lighting Plan. Prior to the installation of any new outdoor light, or as part of the materials submitted with the application for a conditional use permit if part of a larger project, applicant shall submit to the director an exterior lighting plan showing type, intensity, location and color of all lights. If deemed useful or necessary, the director may also require an analysis of sight lines from the blufftop to help ascertain if the lights will be visible from the residential area above the bluff. To the maximum extent feasible, nighttime light and glare shall not affect the residential area on the blufftop, and the director in cases of administrative approvals, and the planning commission in other cases, may place such conditions on the approval as deemed useful or necessary to ensure that this requirement is met; 
b.  Signs. No pole signs shall exceed fifteen feet in height. No new lighted signs shall be directed toward the bluff top. 
4.  Rooftop View Decks. Any use of a rooftop for decks for viewing or similar uses may be permitted but subject to the approval of a conditional use permit; in approving a permit for such a use, the planning commission shall find that by its location, screening, hours of operation or other features, the use will not significantly adversely affect residences on the blufftop, especially during night time hours. 
F.  Area B. In addition to those of the base zone and the PD overlay zone, the following development regulations and standards shall apply to the portion of the Beach Street Area Specific Plan labeled Area B on Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter. 
1.  Front Yard Setbacks. The minimum front yard setback on both sides of West Avenue shall be fifteen feet. 
2.  Public View Access. 
a.  New Development or Additions. For new development or additions of ten percent or greater to the floor area of existing buildings, a fee of two dollars per linear foot of property fronting along the top of the bluff or one hundred dollars, whichever is greater, shall be paid to the city for the purpose of designing, constructing and/or maintaining a public view deck to be constructed on Surf Street or such other location deemed appropriate by the city. 
b.  Fee Charged In-Lieu. The fee is charged in lieu of requiring an offer of dedication for a public accessway along the bluff. Unless an offer or dedication is required for every blufftop property, the opportunity for a coordinated accessway is lost; therefore, in lieu of such a requirement for an offer of dedication on all blufftop properties, all such properties shall pay the fee at the time of new development or redevelopment as a contribution toward the construction of the single public view deck. 
c.  In-Lieu Fee Uses. The fee shall be either placed in a special fund used exclusively for the design, construction, repair or maintenance of facilities contained in the approved public view access plan or may be paid to the general fund as reimbursement to previously incurred costs for the design, construction, repair or maintenance of such facilities. 
G.  Area C. In addition to those of the base zone and the PD overlay zone, the following development regulations and standards shall apply to the portion of the Beach Street Area specific plan labeled Area C on Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter. 
1.  Land Uses. In addition to the uses permitted in the R-2 base zone, public meeting halls may be permitted, subject to obtaining a conditional use permit pursuant to the procedures and findings contained herein and as contained in Section 17.40.030 and Chapter 17.60. Any addition, exterior modification or demolition of the existing Veteran's Memorial Building may be permitted only upon approval of a conditional use permit. 
H.  Area D. The following development regulations and standards shall apply to the portion of the Beach Street Area specific plan labeled Area D on Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter. 
1.  Land Uses. In addition to the uses permitted in the C-2 base zone, all land uses permitted or conditionally permitted in the C-VS zoning district, Section 17.24.120, may be permitted subject to the following: 
a.  Prior Use. The use existed at the time of the adoption of the Beach Street Area specific plan in 1986; and 
b.  Conditional Use Permit. A conditional use permit has been approved for said use pursuant to the procedures and findings contained herein and as contained in Section 17.40.030 and Chapter 17.60. 
2.  Special Findings for Approving a Conditional Use Permit. In addition to the findings required in Section 17.40.030, Chapter 17.60 or any other applicable section of this title, the planning commission shall make the following special findings before approving a conditional use permit in said Area D: 
a.  Offensive Odors. That no offensive odors will result from the proposed use; and, explicitly, that for any fish processing facility, all waste from cleaning, cutting or any other form of seafood preparation shall be stored in refrigerated enclosures; 
b.  Outdoor Storage. That all outdoor storage yards, and dumpsters or waste containers, shall be screened, landscaped and maintained in an attractive manner; 
c.  Light or Glare. That the proposed use will not result in excessive or unreasonable light or glare on adjacent residential or visitor-serving uses; 
d.  Waste Products. That adequate facilities shall be installed and maintained to collect oils, grease or other waste products from entering the storm drainage system; such facilities shall be incorporated into uses including but not limited to, repair and service yard. 
3.  Signs. Other provisions of this title notwithstanding, pole signs as defined in Chapter 17.68 are strictly prohibited. 
4.  Minimum Lot Size for Fish Processing Plant. Because of the need for truck parking, loading and unloading areas, no new fish processing facility may be located on any lot less than six thousand five hundred square feet in size. 
5.  Parking. New uses or expansions to existing uses shall provide parking spaces pursuant to the requirements of Section 17.44.020; provided, however, that the planning commission may approve payment of a parking fee in lieu of providing all or some of the required parking spaces on site. 
I.  Area E. In addition to those in the C-VS base zone and the PD overlay zone, the following development regulations and standards shall apply to the portion of the Beach Street specific plan labeled Area E on Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter. 
1.  Special Findings for Approving a Conditional Use Permit. In addition to the findings required in Section 17.40.030, Chapter 17.60 or any other applicable section of this title, the planning commission shall make the following special findings before approving a conditional use permit in Area E:

i.  All parking areas shall be landscaped; 
ii.  Principal building entryways, signs and any noise-generating activities shall be oriented toward Beach Street and away from any service commercial or residential areas; 
iii.  Activities which may be sensitive to impacts from service-commercial uses, whether noise, odor or visual, shall be adequately buffered or protected from same; the responsibility for designing and maintaining an acceptable visitor environment in this area lies primarily with the developer and operator of the visitor use, not with the residences or service-commercial activities nearby; 
iv.  All dumpsters or thrash receptacles shall be screened and landscaped and shall be placed so as not to impact nearby residential uses. 
J.  Area F. In addition to those of the R-2 base zone and the PD overlay zone the following development regulations and standards shall apply to the portion of the Beach Street Area specific plan labeled Area F on Figure 17.40.100(1) codified at the end of this chapter. 
1.  Land Uses. 
a.  Mobile homes parks of a density greater than that usually permitted in the R-2 district may be allowed, subject to the following: 
i.  The mobilehome park existed at the time of the adoption of the Beach Street Area specific plan and its density does not exceed that at the time of the adoption of said specific plan; and 
ii.  A conditional use permit has been approved for such use pursuant to the procedures and findings contained herein and as contained in Section 17.40.030 and Chapter 17.60.

(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.40.110 - North Main Street specific plan (SP-NM). 
A.  North Main Street Specific Plan Adopted. The zoning regulations and standards for that part of the city illustrated in Figure 17.40.110(1), codified at the end of this chapter shall be the "North Main Street Specific Plan" which is established and provides for regulated development in accordance with the purpose, rationale and objectives set out therein; said specific plan is incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety. 
B.  Division Into Areas. The specific plan is divided into areas where different development standards, uses or mixes of use may be permitted. The areas are described below and illustrated in Figure 17.40.110(2), codified at the end of this chapter. 
Area A: Island to Zanzibar; 
Area B: Elena to Island; 
Area C: State Highway 41 to Elena; 
Area D: State Highway 41 to Radcliffe. 
C.  Allowable Uses. Allowable uses are listed in the applicable primary zoning district. 
D.  Development Standards. In addition to the findings required by Chapter 17.60, the zoning administrator or the planning commission must find that the following development standards have been met before approving a use permit for any use in the North Main Street specific plan: 
1.  Mature Trees. Mature trees shall be shown on site plans submitted for development, use, or building permit. Any mature tree, defined as having a trunk circumference of seventeen inches measure twenty-four inches above grade shall be preserved unless preservation of the tree presents economic hardships to the owner of the property, safety problems, or is severely diseased. The burden of proof of economic hardship, safety or disease shall be on the applicant at the time of application for a development, use or building permit in the specific plan area. Removal of trees for economic hardship, safety, or disease shall be approved by the planning commission or the director as appropriate at the time of permit approval. 
2.  Roofline Variation and View Corridors. The maximum height shall be generally two stories (above subterranean or semi-subterranean parking if provided) and not to exceed twenty-five feet; except that the planning commission may allow up to thirty feet to encourage roofline variations and sloping roof treatments provided that the additional height is necessary for such roof treatment and that corridors protecting significant views are provided. Furthermore, to prevent long, unvarying rooflines, the planning commission shall consider the following guidelines when allowing a project to exceed the usual twenty-five foot limit: 
a.  For buildings fronting on Main Street, not more than one-third of the west elevation of the building roofline and, if different, not more than one-third of the elevation of the longest building roofline shall exceed twenty-five feet in height. This standard is intended as a guideline, not a strict requirement, and the planning commission may vary from this guideline as deemed necessary and useful to meet the intent of this section. 
b.  Flat roofs shall be discouraged wherever possible. All applications for buildings with more than one story shall include a view analysis from the residential neighborhood located east of the project. To the extent practical, significant view opportunities shall be preserved and protected through the use of view corridors and air space easements. 
Assessments of scenic values and preservation of scenic views shall be prepared and implemented according to the visual resources policies of the local coastal program, in particular, policies 12.01, 12.02, 12.05, 12.06, 12.08 and 12.09. 
3.  Specific Plan Fee. Pursuant to the California Government Code, developers shall be assessed a fee reflecting a proportionate share of the cost of the preparation of this specific plan as a condition of approval. 
E.  Off-Site Improvements. In approving any conditional use permit the following will be required as conditions of approval. 
1.  Curb, Gutter, Sidewalk and Street Trees. In addition to any other improvements found necessary by the planning commission, all commercial and residential developments shall be required to install curb, gutter, ten-foot wide sidewalks and street trees pursuant to city standards and/or planted and maintained concrete planter boxes subject to any encroachment permit. The planning commission shall have the option of granting a sidewalk width of not less than six feet where special conditions apply. 
2.  Intersection Improvement Fees. As a condition of approval of any conditional use permit, the developer shall pay a fee for signalization and related improvements at the intersection at Highway One, Highway 41 and Main Street as specified in the specific plan. Said fee shall be proportional to increased traffic generated by the subject project at said intersection as estimated by a traffic engineer and subject to review and approval by the city engineer. The fee shall be placed in a special fund and used strictly for the planning, design or construction of improvements to that intersection. 
3.  Landscaping Improvement Fees. Developers shall pay a fee for the purpose of implementing the landscaping proposals on Main Street and the highway entry corridors. Such moneys shall be placed in a special fund to be used for this purpose. Said fee shall be equal to two dollars per linear foot of Main Street and/or Highway 41 frontage. 
4.  Other Improvements. Other improvements and/or easements related to streets, sewers, water lines, storm drainage, fire hydrants and any other on-site or off-site facility deemed reasonable necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare may be required by the public works director or planning commission, as a condition of approval, to contribute in-kind or through fees to the mitigation of storm water drainage problems, as identified in the storm drain master plan, in proportion to the impacts created by the development. 
5.  Deferments. When the planning commission deems that deferring installation of needed public improvements will help increase the feasibility of a desirable project and will not pose any immediate or unreasonable threat to the public health, safety or welfare, such time deferments may be permitted subject to the posting of adequate bonding or similar security to ensure the installation of the improvements, including an inflation factor, is provided to the city and approved by the city engineer.

Chapter 17.44 - PARKING, DRIVEWAY AND LOADING FACILITIES 
Sections: 
 
17.44.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of these parking, driveway and loading regulations are as follows: 
A.  To minimize street congestion and traffic hazards; 
B.  To provide safe and convenient access to land uses. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.44.020 - Parking facilities. 
A.  Off-Street Parking—General Requirements. 
1.  Facilities Required. For every structure erected or enlarged, and for all land devoted to a new use, and for any structure or land changed to a more intensive use that would require the provision of more parking spaces over what already exists, off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements and standards of this chapter, a change, expansion or intensification of land use which would increase the number of parking spaces required as provided in this title shall be based only upon the number of spaces required for the change or expansion. Except in the North Main Street Commercial Parking Area as defined in Figure 17.44.020(3) as codified at the end of this chapter where all changes in commercial uses including more intense uses not including new construction or new additions will not be required to provide additional onsite parking. 
2.  Requirements for Uses Not Listed. The director shall determine the parking requirement based on the parking required for the most similar use of equivalent intensity. 
3.  Mixed Uses Sites. Where more than one use is located on a site or within a master-planned development with common parking areas, the parking requirements shall be determined by adding the requirements for the individual uses. 
4.  Mixed Function Buildings. Where a building occupied by a single use contains several functions, the parking requirement is to be determined as that required for the principal use based on the total area of all internal functions. 
5.  Joint Use Parking Facilities. The director may authorize the joint use of parking spaces where there is no conflict in the operating hours of the concerned uses or where the total number of spaces is not less than the sum of the individual parking requirements of the joint users, provided that the concerned parties submit an adequate executed agreement governing the joint parking. 
6.  Off-Site Parking Facilities. 
a.  Off-street parking requirements may be met partially or wholly upon a site other than the site on which the use and/or structure is located. Said site shall be located within six hundred feet of the use to be served and an adequate indenture shall be recorded designating the off-street parking facility and the use or structure to be served, providing legal description of the sites, and certifying that the parking facility shall not be used for any other purpose. 
b.  Upon submission of satisfactory evidence that other off-street parking facilities that meet the requirements of this chapter have been provided, or that the use requiring off-site parking has ceased, been removed, or altered so as to no longer require the off-site parking facility, the planning commission shall remove the restriction. 
7.  Parking In-Lieu Fees. 
a.  Where it can be demonstrated that the reasonable and practical development of commercially zoned property precludes the provision of required off-street parking on the property located within or adjacent to the parking management plan area defined in Figure 17.44.020(1) codified at the end of this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk. The planning commission upon recommendations of the director, may permit the applicant to satisfy parking requirements by payment of an in-lieu parking fee. The planning commission will determine the total parking requirements for each individual project at the time of permit review. 
b.  Fees accepted under this provision will be used by the city to provide the additional required parking at another location in lieu of the applicant providing the required off-street parking. Such parking shall be provided within a reasonable distance from the contributing project or within close proximity to public transit providing access to the use. All such fees collected shall be used by the city for the planning, design, acquisition or lease of land, and development and redevelopment of public parking facilities within or adjacent to the parking management plan area and for public transit facilities providing access to said parking. 
c.  Any off-street parking satisfied through this provision shall run with the land and any subsequent change of use that requires more parking shall require subsequent action to satisfy the additional parking requirement. No refund of such payment shall be made when there is a change to a use requiring less parking. 
d.  The number of parking spaces required and used to calculate the in-lieu fee shall be determined according to the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance and this code. 
e.  A change of ownership or the dividing or merging of properties shall not affect an obligation for parking in-lieu fees or a determination that parking requirements have been met according to fees paid for a particular use. 
f.  The fee to be charged for each parking space required shall be set by resolution by the city council and may be modified from time to time, and shall be payable in accordance with administrative policies established in this chapter. In setting such fees, the city council shall consider all costs associated with the provision of the necessary parking including planning, design, land acquisition or lease costs and construction of improvements. 
g.  The per space fee for new construction, additions or changes in occupancy shall be paid in a lump sum or in accordance with a payment plan approved by both the finance director and the city administrator, prior to the issuance of construction permits for the structure or occupancy for which the parking is required or prior to the issuance of a city business license for the activity for which the parking is required, if no construction permit is required. 
h.  All fees collected and all interest earned thereon shall be placed in the parking facilities fund established by the city council and shall be used only for the purposes set forth in this section and for the benefit of the contributing project. 
i.  Nothing in this section shall preclude the formation of a parking assessment district coterminous with the parking management plan area. Any property participating in the in-lieu fee program shall be required to participate in the assessment district if a parking assessment district is established. Funds derived from each property through a combination of the in-lieu fee and assessment payments shall equal the fair market value of the cost of converting the required parking into a municipal parking lot, as estimated by the public works director. 
j.  In-lieu fees accepted by the city shall be credited against a project's full obligation established by an assessment district formula. 
B.  Bicycle Facilities. Each nonresidential use for which ten or more parking spaces are required shall provide facilities where bicycles may be locked, at the rate of one bicycle space for each five vehicle parking spaces unless otherwise determined by the director. The location of such facilities shall be convenient to cyclists and shall be in an open location away from traffic flow near the front of the parking lot.

B.  Protect The Coastal Bluffs. To protect the coastal bluffs in the city from future development which may damage such bluffs, and in an effort to minimize the hazards to life and property. 
C.  Adverse Visual Impacts. To mitigate the potential for adverse visual impacts that can be created by blufftop development and to preserve existing public coastal views for the future enjoyment of the city's residents and visitors. 
D.  Geographic Features. To maintain the unique geographic features of the bluffs and ensure development is subordinate to the character and form of the coastal bluff areas. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.45.020 - Application of regulations. 
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development located on coastal bluff properties as defined in Chapter 17.12. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.45.030 - Conditional use permit required. 
On coastal bluff properties, all development located within the bluff and the bluff setback including new buildings, structures, relocations, additions, extensions and exterior changes to existing buildings and structures, and physical site improvements, including grading, may be allowed subject to the granting of a conditional use permit as provided in Chapter 17.60 and in Section 17.40.030 for P-D suffix zones, except as provided in Sections 17.45.070 and 17.45.080 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.45.040 - Development standards. 
In addition to the primary base zoning district, and suffix zones, combining districts, specific plan requirements, the following standards shall apply within the bluff buffer area for development on coastal bluff properties: 
A.  Development Within The Bluff Buffer Area. Except as provided for in Section 17.45.070, no development is permitted within the bluff buffer area. The bluff buffer may be reduced for existing subdivided parcels where said setback would render that parcel unusable for its designated use. Said buffer may not be reduced, in any case, to less than twenty feet. 
B.  New Development Located Within Fifty Feet Of The Bluff Edge. New development located within fifty feet of the bluff edge shall not exceed a height limit of fourteen feet; provided, however, that for peaked roofs (4 in 12 or greater pitch) and other architectural features, a height of up to seventeen feet may be permitted. 
C.  Permitted Development. Permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect public views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas, and shall be subordinate to the character of the setting. Development shall not impair but facilitate public access, environmental concerns, and public views as provided in the general and local coastal plans. Development shall be coordinated with existing or planned future public facilities. 
D.  Underground Utility Lines. Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 17.48, all service and distribution utility lines for coastal bluff properties shall be installed underground. 
E.  Erosion Or Geologic Instability. New development shall neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion or geologic instability of bluffs. 
F.  Drainage Systems. New development on coastal bluff properties shall be required to install drainage systems to carry runoff inland to the nearest public street, except in areas where the topography prevents such conveyance because additional filling or grading would create greater adverse environmental or visual impacts. In such case, private bluff drainage seaward may be permitted if: 
1.  Drainage System. The drainage system is sized to accommodate drainage from adjacent parcels; and 
2.  Visual Impacts. The system is designed to minimize visual impacts utilizing natural coloring, natural land forms and vegetative planting to hide the system; and

These regulations are intended to locate antennas and equipment where they are least visible from public rights-of-way and to not burden adjacent property owners with adverse visual impacts without unreasonably delaying or preventing installation, maintenance or use of these devices, unreasonably increasing the cost of installation, maintenance or use of these devices, or precluding reception of an acceptable quality signal, consistent with federal law. Satellite dishes that transmit shall be consistent with FCC regulations. 
A.  Residential Districts. 
1.  A satellite dish antenna that is one meter or less in diameter is permitted anywhere on a residential lot as long as it is affixed to the interior side or rear of a structure or the rear half of the roof of the primary dwelling or the roof of a garage or is ground-mounted in the rear yard. Such an antenna may be mounted on a mast to reach the height needed to receive or transmit an acceptable quality signal (e.g. to maintain line-of-sight with the transmitter or view the satellite), provided that a mast higher than twelve feet above the roofline requires approval of a minor use permit. 
2.  A satellite dish greater than one meter in diameter is not permitted in the R-1 and R-2 districts. 
3.  In the R-3 and R-4 Districts, a satellite dish greater than one meter in diameter is permitted only if it is not be visible from a public or private street, unless adequately screened by landscaping and/or materials that harmonize with the elements and characteristics of the property; it is not located in any front yard or any yard adjacent to a public or private street; the maximum height is fourteen feet; and it is set back from the property line a distance equal to the height of the antenna. 
4.  All wires and/or cables necessary for operation of the antenna or reception for the signal shall be placed underground, except for wires or cables attached flush with the surface of the building or the structure of the antenna. 
B.  Other Zoning Districts. 
1.  A satellite dish less than two meters in diameter is permitted anywhere on a lot where a commercial or industrial use is allowed, provided that it is affixed to the interior side or rear of a structure or to the roof of a principal or accessory structure and is sited and screened to minimize visibility from a public or private street. Such an antenna may be mounted on a mast to reach the height needed to receive or transmit an acceptable quality signal (e.g. to maintain line-of-sight with the transmitter or view the satellite), provided that a mast higher than twelve feet above the roofline requires approval of a minor use permit. 
2.  A satellite dish antenna that is more than two meters in diameter cannot be located within a required front or corner side yard and shall be screened from view from public rights-of-way and any adjoining residential district. 
3.  All wires and/or cables necessary for operation of the antenna or reception for the signal shall be placed underground, except for wires or cables attached flush with the surface of the building or the structure of the antenna. 
C.  Waivers. The public services director may grant a waiver from any standard of this section that applies to a satellite antenna that is less than one meter in diameter if the standards (1) unreasonably delays or prevents use of a satellite antenna; (2) unreasonably increases the cost of the installation, maintenance or use of a satellite antenna; or (3) precludes a person from receiving or transmitting an acceptable quality signal from an antenna subject to the standards of this section. The relief granted shall be the minimum necessary to achieve the purposes of this section. No public notice of a waiver is required, and the director's decision is final not subject to appeal.

17.48.400 - Reasonable accommodation procedure. 
This section provides a procedure to request reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Acts) in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures. 
A.  Applicability. 
1.  A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative or any entity, when the application of a requirement of this zoning ordinance or other city requirement, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or developmental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This chapter is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts. 
2.  A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. 
3.  A reasonable accommodation is granted to the household that needs the accommodation and does not apply to successors in interest to the property. 
4.  A reasonable accommodation may be granted in compliance with this chapter without the need for the approval of a variance. 
5.  Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be as described in the following section. 
B.  Application Procedure. 
1.  Application. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted in the form of a letter to the public services director and shall contain the following information: 
A.  The applicant's name, address and telephone number; 
B.  Address of the property for which the request is being made; 
C.  The current actual use of the property; 
D.  The basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled under the Acts; 
E.  The zoning ordinance provision, regulation or policy from which reasonable accommodation is being requested; and 
F.  Why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual. 
2.  Review with Other Land Use Applications. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other discretionary approval (e.g., conditional use permit, coastal development permit, etc.), then the applicant shall file the application for discretionary approval together with the information required by Subsection A above for concurrent review. 
C.  Review Authority. 
1.  Public Services Director. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the public services director, or his/her designee if no approval is sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation. The written determination to grant, grant with modifications, or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made in accordance with the findings and decision as established below. 
2.  Other Review Authority. Requests for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the authority responsible for reviewing the discretionary land use application. The written determination to grant, grant with modifications, or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made in accordance with the findings and decision as established below. 
D.  Findings and Decision. The written decision to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on consideration of the following factors: 
1.  Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an individual disabled under the Acts; 
2.  Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts; 
3.  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; 
4.  Whether the requested reasonable accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a city program or law, including but not limited to land use, zoning, or the local coastal program; 
5.  Potential impact on surrounding uses; 
6.  Physical attributes of the property and structures; and 
7.  Alternative reasonable accommodations that may provide an equivalent level of benefit. 
E.  Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the reviewing authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings required herein. The conditions shall also state whether the accommodation granted shall be rescinded in the event that the person for whom the accommodation was requested no longer resides on the property.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 584, § 5, adopted March 11, 2015, repealed the former Chapter 17.50, §§ 17.50.010—17.50.060, and enacted a new Chapter 17.50 as set out herein. The former Chapter 17.50 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 445, 1995. 
 
17.50.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to: 
A.  Meet the requirements to provide affordable housing contained in Government Code Sections 65580—65589.8 through inclusionary housing; and 
B.  Promote and facilitate the provisions of very low, low, and moderate-income housing consistent with the provisions of Government Code Sections 65915—65918 and the housing element of the general plan. 
(Ord. No. 584, § 5, 3-11-14)  
17.50.020 - General affordable housing requirements. 
A.  Pursuant to the requirements of Government Code Sections 65580—65589, all new residential developments of five or more for-sale units shall provide a minimum of one inclusionary unit or ten percent of the total number of units, whichever is greater, to be affordable to families with incomes in the very low-, low-, or moderate-income ranges, depending on the needs of the city at the time of approval. The lower-income units may be either for rent or for sale, but shall remain affordable for at least thirty years, or such other term approved by the city, consistent with state law. 
B.  In accordance with Government Code Section 65590, the city shall require the developer to provide affordable housing on-site where feasible. If the city determines that this is not feasible based on a detailed economic analysis prepared by a city-contracted consultant at the cost of the applicant, the city shall require the developer to provide such housing at another location in Morro Bay. If the city determines that it is not feasible for the developer to provide such affordable housing off-site, the developer shall pay a fee in lieu of providing such housing. Said fee shall be as prescribed in Section 17.50.030. 
C.  For the purposes of calculating the number of affordable inclusionary units required by this section, any additional units authorized as a density bonus will not be counted in determining the required number of inclusionary units. 
(Ord. No. 584, § 5, 3-11-14)  
17.50.030 - In-lieu fees for affordable housing. 
In cases where the provisions for the required affordable housing are not being met on-site or off-site, the applicant may contribute in-lieu fees. Said fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit or final tract map. Fees shall be established on a project basis using the following method: 
Construction Cost X % of Fee based on Project Size, where construction costs include all expenses related to the development of housing units, including land, construction, on- and off-site infrastructure, and associated soft costs. 
Project Size 	% of each 1 unit cost or fraction thereof 
8 Units 	10% 
9 Units 	15% 
10 Units 	20% 
11 Units 	30% 
12 Units 	40% 
13 Units 	50% 
14 Units 	60% 
15 Units 	70% 
16 Units 	80% 
17 Units 	90% 
18 Units 	100% 
 
A.  Fees accepted for affordable housing shall be used by the city to construct or assist in the construction of housing for rent or sale to very low, low and moderate income families or to purchase land for the purpose of affordable housing or to assist very low-, low- and moderate-income families to afford adequate housing or for other measures to provide housing for low- and moderate-income families. The city may, at its option, transfer in-lieu fees to another public agency as a nonprofit housing provider for the purpose of providing affordable housing in the city of Morro Bay. 
(Ord. No. 584, § 5, 3-11-14)  
17.50.040 - Density bonuses and incentives. 
A.  Applicability. Pursuant to the requirements of Government Code Sections 65915—65918, the provisions of this Section apply to the construction of five or more housing units that satisfy one or more of the following criteria: 
1.  At least ten percent of the units are designated for low-income households; 
2.  At least five percent of the units are designated for very low-income households; 
3.  At least ten percent of the units are designated for moderate-income households, provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase; 
4.  One hundred percent of the units are designated for seniors citizens as defined in Sections 51.3 and 51.12 of the Civil Code or mobile home park that limits residency based on age requirements for housing for older persons pursuant to Government Code Section 798.76 or 799.5; 
5.  Donation of land to the city consisting of at least one acre, or of sufficient developable acreage and zoning classification to permit construction of at least forty units, and not less than ten percent of the residential units in the proposed development, that are affordable to very-low income households. 
B.  Calculating the Density Bonus. A density bonus shall be calculated on a sliding scale based upon the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing units exceeds the minimum number of affordable units required to qualify for a density bonus established in Section 17.50.020. The density bonus shall be calculated as follows: 
1.  A twenty percent density bonus, increasing by an additional one and one-half for each additional one percent increase in low-income units above the initial ten percent threshold, per Section 17.50.040(A)(1), above. 
2.  A twenty percent density bonus, increasing by an additional two and one-half percent for each additional one percent increase in very low-income units above the initial five percent threshold, per Section 17.50.040(A)(2), above. 
3.  A twenty percent density bonus for senior citizen housing developments pursuant Government Code Section 65915(g)(3). 
4.  A five percent density bonus, increasing by an additional one percent for each additional one percent increase in moderate-income units above the initial ten percent threshold, per Section 17.50.040(A)(4), above. 
5.  When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that is eligible for a density bonus under Section17.50.030(A) and includes a childcare facility that will be located on the premises of, or adjacent to, the housing development, the city shall grant either: 
a.  An additional density bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than the square footage of the childcare facility; or 
b.  An additional concession or incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the childcare facility. 
6.  Maximum density bonus. The maximum density bonus authorized by this section, Section 17.50.030(A), and Section 17.50.030(B), collectively, is thirty-five percent when a project provides either eleven percent very low-income units, twenty percent low-income units, or forty percent moderate-income units. All density bonus calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number of housing units. 
C.  Developer Incentives. 
1.  Restrictions. When an applicant seeks a density bonus as prescribed by Government Code Section 65915, the city will grant the number of developer incentives as required by Section 17.50.040(C)(2), below, unless it makes any of the following findings: 
a.  The developer incentives are not required in order to provide affordable housing, as defined in Section 50052.3 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Government Code Section 65915(c). 
b.  The developer incentives would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of Subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. 
c.  The developer incentives would be contrary to state or federal law. 
2.  Number of Developer Incentives. A developer eligible to receive a density bonus shall receive the following number of concessions or incentives, in addition to a density bonus: 
a.  One concession or incentive for projects that provide either ten percent of the units affordable to low-income households, five percent of the units affordable to very low-income households, ten percent of the units affordable to moderate-income households, or childcare facilities. 
b.  Two concessions or incentives for projects that provide either twenty percent of the units affordable to low-income households, at least ten percent of the units affordable to very low-income households, or twenty percent of the units affordable to moderate-income households. 
c.  Three concessions or incentives for projects that provide either thirty percent of the units affordable to low-income households, at least fifteen percent of the units affordable to very low-income households, or thirty percent of the units affordable to moderate-income households. 
3.  Parking. Upon request of a developer eligible to receive a density bonus, the city shall grant the following parking standards, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, for the entire project as required by Government Code Section 65915(p)(1): 
a.  Zero to one-bedroom units—one on-site parking space per unit; 
b.  Two or more-bedroom units—two on-site parking spaces per unit. 
4.  Developer Incentives Defined. For the purposes of this section, concession or incentive means any of the following: 
a.  Reduced site development standards or modified zoning code or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be required that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. 
b.  Approval of mixed-use zoning if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the housing project. 
c.  A density bonus greater than the amount required by this section. 
d.  Deferred or waived planning, plan check, construction permit, and/or development impact fees, in accordance with any fee deferral and waiver process and policies adopted by the city. 
e.  Direct financial aid in the form of a loan or grant to subsidize off-site improvements, land or construction costs. 
f.  Other regulatory developer incentives proposed by the developer or the city that result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. 
5.  Waivers and Modifications of Development Standards. 
a.  Proposal. In accordance with Government Code Section 65915(e), an applicant may propose a waiver or modification of development standards if they would physically preclude the construction of a development meeting the criteria for applicability, at the densities or with the developer incentives permitted by this section. 
A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this subdivision shall neither reduce nor increase the number of developer incentives to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to Section 17.50.040(D), above. 
b.  Grounds for Denial. In accordance with Government Code Section 65915(e), the city council, or the coastal commission on appeal, may deny an applicant's request to waive or modify the city's development standards in any of the following circumstances: 
1.  The application does not conform with the requirements of this Section, Government Code Section 65915-65918, or Coastal Act Section 30604(f). 
2.  The applicant fails to demonstrate that the city's development standards physically preclude the utilization of a density bonus on a specific site. 
3.  The waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2), upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. 
4.  The waiver or reduction would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources. 
5.  The waiver or reduction would be contrary to state or federal law. 
6.  If in the coastal zone, the project is found to be inconsistent with the local coastal program (including but not limited to sensitive habitat, agriculture, public view shed, public services, public recreational access and open space protections), with the exception of the density bonus. 
D.  Application and Evaluation. 
1.  All Applications. All applications for a density bonus, developer incentive, or waiver or modification of development standards must include the following information:

Chapter 17.52 - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS[2] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— The performance standards applicable to the North Main Street specific plan have been integrated into this chapter. 
 
17.52.005 - Compatibility with nearby uses. 
Potential conflicts with the adjacent uses shall be minimized particularly with regard to but not necessarily limited to noise, glare, odors, hazards and screening as described in the sections below. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.010 - Fire and explosion hazards. 
All activities involving, and all storage of flammable and explosive materials shall be provided with adequate safety devices against the hazard of fire and explosion and adequate fire fighting and fire-suppression equipment and devices standard in industry and as approved by the fire department. All incineration is prohibited. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.020 - Radioactivity or electrical disturbance. 
Devices which radiate radio-frequency energy shall be so operated as not to cause interference with any activity carried on beyond the boundary line of the property upon which the device is located. Further, no radiation of any kind shall be emitted which is dangerous to humans. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.030 - Noise requirements. 
A.  General Noise Limitations. Any business operation with sustained or intermittent noise levels exceeding seventy dB ldn (or CNEL) as described by the noise element including, but not limited to, wood or machine milling, air hammers, generators, or prolonged or excessive truck deliveries, will not be allowed within one hundred feet of residential uses, hospitals, and other noise sensitive uses unless noise levels are mitigated in compliance with this section. 
B.  Operational Hours. All commercial and industrial deliveries and loud commercial activities such as loading and unloading, leaf blowers, bands with loudspeakers within one hundred feet of a residential use shall be limited to the hours between seven a.m. and ten p.m. 
C.  Review Of Development Projects. The city shall review new public and private development proposals to determine conformance with the policies of the noise element. Where the development of a project may result in land uses being exposed to existing or projected future noise levels exceed the levels specified by the policies of the noise element, the city shall require an acoustical analysis early in the review process so that noise mitigation may be included in the project design. For development not subject to environmental review, the requirements for an acoustical analysis shall be implemented prior to the issuance of a building permit. The requirements for the content of an acoustical analysis are given in subsection E of this section. At the discretion of the city, the requirement for an acoustical analysis may be waived provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
1.  Size of Development. The development is for less than five single-family dwellings or for office buildings, churches or meeting halls having a total gross floor area less than ten thousand square feet; 
2.  Noise Source. The noise source in question consists of a single transportation noise source (roadway, railway or airport) for which up-to-date noise exposure information is available. An acoustical analysis will be required when the noise source in question is a stationary noise source or when the noise source consists of multiple transportation noise sources; 
3.  Noise Exposure. The existing or projected future noise exposure at the exterior of the buildings which will contain noise sensitive uses or within proposed outdoor activity areas (other than playgrounds and parks) does not exceed sixty-five dB Ldn (or CNEL) prior to mitigation. For playgrounds and parks, the existing or projected future noise exposure may not exceed seventy-five dB Ldn (or CNEL) prior to mitigation; 
4.  Topography. The topography in the project area is flat, and the noise source and receiving land use are at the same grade; and 
5.  Noise Mitigation. Effective noise mitigation, as determined by the city is incorporated into the project design to reduce noise exposure to the levels specified in Table 17.52.030(1), codified at the end of this chapter. Such measures may include the use of building setbacks, building orientation, noise barriers and the standard noise mitigation packages contained within the acoustical design manual. If closed windows are required for compliance with interior noise level standards, air conditioning or a mechanical ventilation system will be required. 
D.  Noise Reduction Measures Required. The planning commission shall consider one or more of the following mitigation measures where existing noise levels significantly impact existing noise sensitive land uses or where cumulative increase in noise levels resulting from the new development significantly impact noise sensitive land uses: 
1.  Rerouting Traffic. Rerouting traffic, if feasible, onto streets that have low traffic volumes or onto streets that do not adjoin noise sensitive land uses; 
2.  Rerouting Trucks. Rerouting trucks, if feasible, onto streets that do not adjoin noise sensitive land uses; 
3.  Noise Barriers. Construction of noise barriers as long as such barriers do not significantly negatively impact coastal or scenic views; and 
4.  Acoustical treatment of buildings. 
E.  Requirements for an Acoustical Analysis. An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the noise regulations shall: 
1.  Be the financial responsibility of the applicant; 
2.  Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment and architectural acoustics; 
3.  Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to adequately describe local conditions. Where actual field measurements cannot be conducted, all sources of information used for calculation purposes shall be fully described. When the use being studied is a commercial use, all noise sources related to the service and maintenance of the facility shall be considered, including parking lot and landscape maintenance, refuse collection and truck loading/unloading activities; 
4.  Estimate existing and projected (twenty years) noise levels in terms of the descriptors used in Tables 17.52.030(1) and (2), codified at the end of this chapter and compare those levels to the adopted policies of the noise element. Projected future noise levels shall take into account noise from planned streets, highways and road connections; 
5.  Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies of the noise element, giving preference to proper site planning and design over mitigation measures which require the construction of noise barriers or structural modifications to buildings which contain noise sensitive land uses; 
6.  Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been implemented; and 
7.  Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.040 - Vibration. 
No vibration shall be permitted so as to cause a noticeable tremor, measurable without instruments at the lot line. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.070 - Smoke, fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases and other forms of air pollution. 
No smoke, fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases and other forms of air pollution emission shall be permitted at any point which exceeds allowable air pollution control district standards. The following standards shall apply to all uses and/or operations except agriculture operations: 
A.  Discharge Restrictions. No person shall discharge from any source whatsoever such quantities of air contaminates or other material which may cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of persons or the public, or which may endanger the comfort, repose, health, or safety of any such persons or the public, or which may cause, or have a natural tendency to cause, injury or damage to business or property. 
B.  Discharge Duration. No person shall discharge into the atmosphere from any source whatsoever an air contaminant, other that uncombined water vapor, for a period or periods aggregating more than three minutes in any one hour which is: 
1.  As dark or darker in shade than is designated as No. 2 on the Ringlemann Chart, as published by the United States Bureau of Mines; or 
2.  Of such opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal to or greater than does smoke described in subsection (B)(1) of this section. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.080 - Lighting, illuminated signs and glare. 
A.  Other sections of this title notwithstanding, no illumination may be directed toward the adjacent residential uses and onto streets. Lighting glare shall be screened from the residences, hotels, streets, and other glare sensitive uses. 
B.  No direct or reflected glare, whether produced by floodlight, high temperature processes such as combustion or welding, or other processes, so as to be visible from any boundary line of property on which the same is produced shall be permitted. Sky-reflected glare from buildings or portions thereof shall be so controlled by such reasonable means as are practical to the end that the said sky reflected glare will not inconvenience or annoy persons or interfere with the use and enjoyment of property in and about the area where it occurs. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.090 - Liquid or solid wastes. 
No discharge at any point into any public sewer, private sewage disposal system, or stream, or into the ground, of any materials of such nature or temperature as can contaminate any water supply, interfere with bacterial processes in sewage treatment, or otherwise cause the emission of dangerous or offensive elements, shall be permitted, except in accord with standards approved by the California Department of Public Health or such other governmental agency as shall have jurisdiction of such activities. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.52.100 - Chemicals. 
Any business involving the uses or storage of noxious chemicals, including but not limited to pesticides and herbicides, other than those packaged for retail sales, or large volumes of solvents or flammable liquids (excluding gas stations), will not be allowed within one hundred feet of residential uses unless otherwise approved by the director.

(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.58.020 - Applicability of procedures for coastal development permits. 
The regulations set forth in this chapter shall apply to development within the coastal zone, except for the following: 
A.  Tidelands, Submerged Lands or Public Trust Lands. Projects on any tidelands, submerged lands or on public trust lands, whether filled or unfilled, lying within the coastal zone, for which applications must be made directly with the California Coastal Commission subsequent to obtaining other applicable city discretionary permits and prior to issuance of city building permits, as required by the Morro Bay Municipal Code. 
B.  Determination of Site Location. 
1.  The director shall determine whether the project is within the city's or coastal commission jurisdiction of purposes of notice, hearings and appeals prior to acceptance of the application for filing. 
2.  In the case of dispute over such determinations, the director shall forward the matter to the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission for a final written determination. The coastal development permit application shall not be accepted for filing by the city until the determination of the Executive Director is received and only if he/she determines that the project is within the city's jurisdiction. 
C.  Developments Specifically Exempted. Developments specifically exempted according to Public Resources Code Section 30610 and 13250 of the Coastal Commission administrative regulations or other applicable provisions of the California Coastal Act. 
D.  Repair or Maintenance Activities. Repair or maintenance activities which do not result in an addition to, or enlargement or expansion of the object of such repair or maintenance activities do not require a coastal development permit; provided, however, that if the director determines that certain extraordinary methods of repair and maintenance that involve a risk or substantial adverse environmental impact shall, by regulation, require that a permit be obtained under this chapter. 
E.  Permit Requirements for the Replacement of Utility Connections. The installation, testing, and placement in service of the replacement of any necessary utility connection between an existing service facility and any development approved pursuant to this section does not require a coastal development permit, provided, however, that the director may where necessary require reasonable conditions to mitigate any adverse impacts on coastal resources, including scenic resources. 
F.  Maintenance Dredging of Harbor Permit Exclusion. Maintenance dredging of existing navigation channels or moving dredge material from such channels to a disposal area outside the coastal zone, in conformance to the permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers shall not require a coastal development permit. 
G.  Additions to Existing Single-Family Homes. 
1.  Properties located outside the California Commission Appeal jurisdiction: No coastal permit required for additions to existing single-family residences. 
2.  Properties located within the California Coastal Commission appeal jurisdiction: 
a.  No coastal permit required for additions of ten percent or less to existing single-family residence and temporary buildings which do not require a building permit. 
b.  Regular coastal permit required for additions greater than ten percent of gross floor area, fences, garages, and other ancillary structures, including secondary units (secondary dwelling units). 
H.  New Single-Family Residences. 
1.  East of Main Street. Administrative coastal permits will be required for construction of all new single-family residences until the city obtains the approval of the Coastal Commission to exempt the area East of Main Street to the LCP urban/rural boundary except for those areas within a Coastal Commission appeal jurisdiction, an ESH overlay zone or on properties of ten percent of greater slopes, from the requirement of obtaining a coastal development permit for the purpose of construction of new, one story single-family residences and two story residences when the second floor is less than forty percent of the lot area. The director is authorized by this chapter to take whatever steps are necessary to obtain coastal commission approval. 
2.  West of Main Street. 
a.  Outside Appeal Jurisdiction. Administrative coastal permits required for properties located west of Main Street and not within the appeal jurisdiction or ESH zone. 
b.  Within Appeal Jurisdiction. Regular coastal permits required for properties located west of Main Street and within the appeal jurisdiction or ESH zone.

17.58.030 - Regular coastal development permits. 
All coastal development permits within the jurisdiction of the city, which do not fall within the "administrative" or "emergency" categories shall be processed as a "regular" coastal development permit.

Any activity anywhere in the coastal zone that involves the conversion of any existing multiple-unit residential structure to a time-share project, estate, or use, as defined in Section 11003.5 of the Business and Professions Code shall not require a coastal development permit. If any improvement to an existing structure is otherwise exempt from the permit requirements of this section, no coastal development permit shall be required for that improvement on the basis that it is to be made in connection with any conversion exempt pursuant to this subsection. The division of a multiple unit residential structure into condominiums, as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, shall not be considered a time share project, estate, or use for purposes of this subsection. This subsection shall not be applied in such a way that the city's supply of affordable housing shall be significantly jeopardized or in any other way that would be inconsistent with the housing element of the city's general plan. 
B.  Public Notice Requirements for Regular Coastal Development Permits. 
1.  Posting. At least ten calendar days prior to action on the coastal development permit the city shall post, in a conspicuous place on the site and at the Morro Bay branch of the public library, notice on a form provided by the director indicating that such application has been submitted.

The planning commission may approve, conditionally approve, or deny any application submitted according to the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Protective Policy Precedence. Where policies within the LUP overlap, the policy which is the most protective of coastal resources shall take precedence; and where there are conflicts between the policies set forth in the LUP and existing ordinances, the policies of the LUP shall take precedence; the policies of the LUP shall not conflict with those of the other elements of the general plan. 
3.  Findings of the Planning Commission. In order to approve any coastal development permit, the findings of the planning commission shall be that the approved or conditionally approved project is consistent with the applicable provisions of the certified local coastal program. For every development between the nearest public road and the sea or the shoreline of any body of water, the planning commission shall make a specific finding that such development is in conformity with the public access and public recreation policies of Chapter 3 of the California Coastal Act. 
4.  City Council Approval Authority. In the event that the city council is the city body having sole approval authority over a proposed development license, permit or entitlement for which a coastal development permit is being concurrently processed, the city council shall take the action otherwise required of the planning commission under this chapter, including related notice and permit procedures. 
5.  Time Limit on Action Extension. In cases where the coastal development permit is processed in conjunction with a conditional use permit and/or subdivision permit and/or a concept plan requiring city council approval and/or in cases where the coastal development permit is required for a project lying within the review jurisdiction of the Coastal Commission, the time limit may be extended to the time limits designated for the other permits required for the proposed development or use. Further extensions to either time limit may be granted upon consent of the applicant in conformance with state law. 
E.  Notice of Local Government Action when Hearing Continued. If a decision on a development permit is continued by the local government to a time which is neither (1) previously stated in the notice provided according to Section 17.58.030B, nor (2) announced at the hearing as being continued to a time certain, the city shall provide notice of the further hearings (or action on the proposed development) in the same manner, and within the same time limits as established in Section 17.58.030B.

(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
Chapter 17.68 - SIGNS 
Sections: 
 
17.68.010 - Purpose and intent. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate signs as an information system which expresses the character and environment of the city and its community. It is further intended that these regulations recognize the importance of business activity to the economic vitality of the city. Standards shall attempt to: 
A.  Encourage communications which aid orientation and identify activities; 
B.  Preserve and enhance the aesthetic character of the surroundings; 
C.  Relate signing to basic principles of good design, encouraging pleasing community appearance; and 
D.  Restrict signs which overload the public's capacity to receive information, violate privacy or which increase the probability of accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.68.015 - Findings. 
In adopting the regulations for signs, the city council does find the following: 
A.  That an excessive amount of signage, both in terms of number and size, as well as improper shape or design, can be distracting to motorists and pedestrians and this condition adversely effects the public safety by creating a potential traffic hazard; 
B.  That excessive and poorly designed signs are confusing and reduce the effectiveness of all signs; this condition reduces the ability of residents and visitors to readily locate public facilities as well as businesses and services. Consequently, this condition not only adversely affects public safety by interfering with safe travel but also affects the public welfare by reducing convenience to residents and visitors and the viability of commercial districts; 
C.  That signs provide important information to the public for a variety of purposes: excessive and poorly designed signs interfere with the effective transmitting of this information to the detriment of the public welfare; 
D.  That excessive and poorly designed signs detract from the city's appearance and visual environment: this fact is recognized both in the city's general plan as well as its certified local coastal program. The visual environment is important to the property values and pleasant, enjoyable quality of life for residents and, therefore, signs which degrade that environment adversely affect the public welfare. Furthermore, the visual quality of the coastal zone, which encompasses virtually the entire city, is recognized in the California Coastal Act as a resource of statewide importance and, therefore, regulation of the size, shape, design and other features of signs which become part of the visual environment and which can detract from it if not carefully controlled is important for protecting this public resource. Also, the visual quality of the city enhances its appeal to the tourists who contribute significantly to the local economy; therefore, protection and enhancement of the visual environment is important to the vitality of the local economy. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
17.68.020 - Definitions. 
For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply: 
"Area of sign" means and shall be computed as the entire area measured in square feet, within a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of lettering, representations, emblems, logos or any figure or integral part of the display or used to differentiate such sign from the background against which it is placed (exclusive of a background panel the same color as the wall to which it is attached). Only one face of a double-faced sign shall be considered in determining sign area provided both sides are of essentially similar design and not more than twelve inches apart and on planes parallel to each other. The support, uprights or structure on which any sign is supported shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports, uprights or structures are designed in such a manner as to form an integral part of the sign display. Where a sign consists of a series of individual letters, numerals, symbols or other similar components and is painted or attached flat against the wall of a building or structure, and where such components are without integrated background definition and are not within a circumscribed or framed area, the total area of the sign shall be defined as the sum of the area within not more than eight straight lines enclosing such components plus twenty percent of the area within the lines. Stripes or designs on the building whose principal purpose is to accentuate, highlight or exaggerate sign(s) shall be construed as part of such signs(s) when calculating area of sign(s). 
"Attraction board" means a device used to display information regarding conveniences, services and rates currently offered by facilities providing temporary accommodation. 
"Bench sign" means a sign located on any part of the surface of a bench or seat placed on or adjacent to a public right-of-way. 
"Billboard" means the same as outdoor off-site freestanding sign.

Chapter 17.70 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES 
Sections: 
 
17.70.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The intent of this chapter is to regulate adult entertainment businesses to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult entertainment businesses in close proximity to each other in proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, religious institutions, and residential uses. Adult entertainment businesses, because of their nature, are recognized as producing negative secondary impacts, particularly when these businesses are concentrated or located near sensitive uses. The purpose of this ordinance is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to reduce or eliminate the adverse secondary effects and prevent any deleterious location or concentration of adult entertainment businesses, while permitting the location of adult entertainment businesses within the city limits. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended market. 
(Ord. 470 § 1 (part), 1999)  
17.70.020 - Applicability. 
The provisions of this section apply to uses operated as adult entertainment business establishments in addition to all other applicable requirements of this title. The establishment of an adult use shall include the opening of such business as a new business, the relocation of such business, the conversion of an existing business location to any adult use, or the granting of permits required of masseurs and masseuses which would have the effect of the establishment of an adult use or the intensification of an existing adult use.

(Ord. 470 § 1 (part), 1999)

Appendix A 
The language contained in this appendix is from Measure "A," approved by the voters in 1986, and is provided for informational purposes. 
Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to prevent Morro Bay from becoming an oil port, personnel-boat center or other logistical base for offshore oil operation. 
Findings. 
These findings are based on the City of Morro Bay's General Plan, Housing Element, EIR for Appropriate Water rights in the Morro and Chorro Basin, May 1986; Quarterly and Annual Water Reports and other documents and information available and familiar to the City Council and the people of Morro Bay. 
A.  Environment Degradation. 
1.  Sensitive Habitat Areas. The City is a small community with many unique and environmentally sensitive habitat areas. These are critical wetlands habitats for several rare and endangered plant and animal species. Morro Bay is a bird sanctuary established by the local Audubon Society. 
2.  Natural Estuaries. The Estuary is among the last remaining natural estuaries along the coast of California and needs to be protected. 
3.  Physical Settings. The City is located in a physical setting with spectacular visual qualities. The visual resources of the community serve as valuable assets to both City residents and visitors. 
4.  Environmental Studies. Environmental studies designed to evaluate the potential impacts of oil and gas exploration and extraction activities on sensitive marine and coastal resources are not yet complete. Until these studies are completed, it is impossible to weigh the risks of offshore oil development against the potential royalties or energy benefits. 
5.  Environmental Impact Reports of Potential Spills. Environmental impact reports prepared to assess the effects of offshore drilling actually predict large scale oil spills. In addition to the destruction of marine life, spills could reach the shoreline, destroying habitat and reducing or eliminating seabird and other animal populations. 
B.  Effects On Morro Bay Economy. 
1.  Commercial Fishing Significance. The commercial fishing industry historically played a significant role in the development of Morro Bay, and continues to provide an economic source for the community as well as serving as an important tourist attraction. The California Coastal Act of 1976 requires Morro Bay to protect and, where feasible, upgrade commercial and recreational fishing facilities. The City has a policy of giving priority to commercial fisheries in existing harbor facilities and in new harbor development. 
2.  Preservation. Morro Bay is one of the last true fishing ports along the coast of California and as such should be preserved. 
3.  Commercial Fishing Needs. There is a shortage of suitable wharfage space, moorings and areas for expansion of the commercial fishing industry. Morro Bay Harbor cannot accommodate boats of the size generally associated with oil development service bases. To do so would require a total redesign and redevelopment of the harbor and a tremendous amount of dredging. Lands available for additional wharfage are critical to the City's plans to develop facilities to meet the priority needs of the commercial fishing industry. 
4.  Conflict with Oil Support Vessels. Due to the similarities in the requirements of commercial fishing boats and oil support vessels and because the oil industry can afford to pay more for the services required by their boats than the fishing industry, commercial fishing would tend to be displaced. 
5.  Tourism. Tourism is an important part of the City's economy with the quality of the beaches and the beautiful visual resources being a prime factor in the success of the tourist industry. Oil and gas development anywhere off Central California could have disastrous effect on beaches within the City and the tourist industry. 
C.  Impact Of Onshore Facilities. 
1.  Support Facilities. Support facilities for offshore oil and gas development cannot be accommodated in the City. The City's Local Coastal Program contains no sites designated onshore support facilities associated with offshore oil development. Any site in the City would have debilitating effects on the local economy and environment. 
2.  Groundwater. The City relies solely on finite groundwater basins currently in overdraft conditions resulting in a complete building moratorium which has only been partially alleviated. There is not sufficient water to accommodate any oil support facilities in the City. 
3.  General Plan, Housing Element. The goals for 1986 in the General Plan, Housing Element, particularly for affordable housing are not being met due to lack of water. Location of oil crews in Morro Bay would put greater demand for housing than could be met, thereby displacing lower income residents. 
D.  Consistency. 
1.  General Plan. This chapter is consistent with the City's General Plan. 
2.  Local Coastal Program. This chapter is consistent with the City's Local Coastal Program. 
3.  Initiative Ordinance Number 283. Adoption of the Ordinance codified in this chapter by the people of the City of Morro Bay shall repeal that Initiative Ordinance Number 283 adopted by the City Council of the City on April 28, 1987 which became effective on May 28, 1986. 
4.  Consistency. Adoption of said Ordinance by the people does not amend nor rescind any consistent provisions of the General Plan, Local Coastal Program or Zoning Ordinances but does strengthen and define such consistent provisions. 
(Ord. 445 § 3 (part), 1995)  
ORDINANCE NO. 197 
AN ORDINANCE REQUIRING VOTER APPROVAL FOR ANNEXATIONS 
The people of the City of Morro Bay do ordain an ordinance relating to voter approval on annexations as follows: 
Except for territory which is dedicated solely and entirely to a permanent public use, no annexation of territory to the city shall become effective until approved by a vote of the people at a general or special election held after the final decision by the Council to annex such territory. 
 I, BONITA KAY MURRAY, Deputy City Clerk of the City of Morro Bay, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of an ordinance adopted by a majority vote of the electors voting in the General Municipal Election held in the City of Morro Bay on the 8th day of April, 1980. 
DATED: June 24, 1981

ORDINANCE NO. 266 
AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING A GROWTH MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE WHICH WILL ALLOW FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF OUR SCARCE WATER RESOURCES AND PROTECT THE SMALL TOWN CHARACTER AND SURROUNDING OPEN SPACE OF THE CITY 
Be it ordained by the people of the City of Morro Bay as follows: 
SECTION 1. Both the Coastal Commission certified Land Use Plan and the Morro Bay city council-adopted Water Management Plan allow for a city residential population to grow from present 9600 to 12,200 by the year 2000 IF ADDITIONAL WATER RESOURCES OF ADEQUATE QUALITY AND QUANTITY ARE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN. In order to insure even and balanced growth during the 16 year period from January 1, 1985 through December 31, 2000, building permits will be limited to a number permitting an annual increase in population which would achieve the 12,200 person goal by the year 2000. No further residential building will be permitted after a population of 12,200 has been reached unless an increase has been approved by a majority vote at a regular or special election. 
SECTION. 2. If water and wastewater treatment capacities become available allowing for a population increase beyond 12,200, the growth management procedures of this ordinance may be altered ONLY BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE PEOPLE AT A REGULAR OR SPECIAL ELECTION. 
SECTION 3. Residential building permits in 1985 will be limited to 70 residential units. The city council with advice of the planning commission, will determine by January 15 of each calendar year thereafter the mix of multi-unit and single family residential units for that calendar year. The 70 unit ceiling may be increased or decreased by a factor not exceeding 10 percent if necessary to achieve the alloted annual population growth target. The determination of the mix will be based on a study of the historical building permit pattern for the decade prior to 1977 and the years since 1982, plus an estimate of population increase of the previous year. Final adjustment of the building permit limit in each year will be made by the city council after a public hearing. 
SECTION 4. In any calendar year the commercial and industrial building permits issued shall not require more than 130% of the water allocated to residential units that year. 
SECTION 5. Residential building permit approvals will follow Coastal Act priorities for water allocation required by Coastal Development Permit 4-81-309A or as revised after the Coastal Commission review scheduled for December 1984. These priorities shall be reviewed again when the pipe replacement program is completed and necessary amendments submitted to the Coastal Commission. 
SECTION 6. For purposes of awarding building permits, only those development proposals which meet the definition of infill now in use for water allocations may be approved. This definition was approved by city council Resolution No. 26-84 on March 12, 1984. 
SECTION 7. Land Use Plan policies 6.01 through 6.08 have been designed to preserve open space and agricultural land within the city limits. These policies and the zoning ordinances which now implement them may be amended or repealed ONLY BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE PEOPLE AT A REGULAR OR SPECIAL ELECTION held after final approval of an amendment or repeal by the city council and prior to submission to the Coastal Commission. 
SECTION 8. Nonprofit public facilities (e.g. public buildings, libraries, senior centers, etc.) supported in whole or in part by public funds are exempted from the permit limitations in Sections 3 and 4. 
SECTION 9. Severance. If any portion of this ordinance is held invalid for any reason by a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and severable portion thereof and such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions. 
SECTION 10. This ordinance shall supersede all other ordinances in conflict herewith. 
I, GARY A. NAPPER, City Clerk of the City of Morro Bay, do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of an ordinance adopted by a majority vote of the electors voting in the general municipal election held in the City of Morro Bay on the 6th day of November, 1984.
