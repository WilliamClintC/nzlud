USE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The following information is provided to assist in the use and proper maintenance of this Code of Ordinances.
DISTRIBUTION OF COPIES
1. OFFICIAL COPY. The “OFFICIAL COPY” of the Code of Ordinances must be kept by the City Clerk and should be identified as the “OFFICIAL COPY.”
2. DISTRIBUTION. Other copies of the Code of Ordinances should be made available to all persons having a relatively frequent and continuing need to have access to ordinances which are in effect in the City as well as reference centers such as the City Library, County Law Library, and perhaps the schools.
3. SALE. The sale or distribution of copies in a general fashion is not recommended as experience indicates that indiscriminate distribution tends to result in outdated codes being used or misused.
4. RECORD OF DISTRIBUTION. The City Clerk should be responsible for maintaining an accurate and current record of persons having a copy of the Code of Ordinances. Each official, elected or appointed, should return to the City, upon leaving office, all documents, records and other materials pertaining to the office, including this Code of Ordinances.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 372.13[4])
NUMBERING OF ORDINANCES AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
It is recommended that a simple numerical sequence be used in assigning ordinance numbers to ordinances as they are passed. For example, if the ordinance adopting the Code of Ordinances is No. 163, we would suggest that the first ordinance passed changing, adding to, or deleting from the Code be assigned the number 164, the next ordinance be assigned the number 165, and so on. We advise against using the Code of Ordinances numbering system for the numbering of ordinances.
CODE OF ORDINANCES APPENDIX
CODE OF ORDINANCES - BELMOND, IOWA
APPENDIX - 2
RETENTION OF AMENDING ORDINANCES
Please note that two books should be maintained: (1) the Code of Ordinances. and (2) an ordinance book. We will assist in the maintenance of the Code of Ordinances book, per the Supplement Agreement, by revising and returning appropriate pages for the Code of Ordinances book as required to accommodate ordinances amending the Code. The City Clerk is responsible for maintaining the ordinance book and must be sure that an original copy of each ordinance adopted, bearing the signatures of the Mayor and Clerk, is inserted in the ordinance book and preserved in a safe place.
SUPPLEMENT RECORD
A record of all supplements prepared for the Code of Ordinances is provided in the front of the Code. This record will indicate the number and date of the ordinances adopting the original Code and of each subsequently adopted ordinance which has been incorporated in the Code. For each supplemented ordinance, the Supplement Record will list the ordinance number, date, topic, and chapter or section number of the Code affected by the amending ordinance. A periodic review of the Supplement Record and ordinances passed will assure that all ordinances amending the Code have been incorporated therein.
DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTS
Supplements containing revised pages for insertion in each Code will be sent to the Clerk. It is the responsibility of the Clerk to see that each person having a Code of Ordinances receives each supplement so that each Code may be properly updated to reflect action of the Council in amending the Code.
AMENDING THE CODE OF ORDINANCES
The Code of Ordinances contains most of the laws of the City as of the date of its adoption and is continually subject to amendment to reflect changing policies of the Council, mandates of the State, or decisions of the Courts. Amendments to the Code of Ordinances can only be accomplished by the adoption of an ordinance.
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.2)
The following forms of ordinances are recommended for making amendments to the Code of Ordinances:
ADDITION OF NEW PROVISIONS

The Zoning Officer shall have the power to enter at reasonable times upon the public and private grounds in any mobile home park for the purpose of inspecting and investigating to determine compliance
CHAPTER 145 MOBILE HOMES AND MOBILE HOME PARKS
with this chapter. It is the duty of every resident of a mobile home park to give the management thereof access to any part of such park at reasonable times for the purpose of making such improvements, repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with this chapter. The Zoning Officer shall notify the operator of any mobile home park of any violations of this chapter, which notification shall be in writing and shall state the violations, state in general the remedial action necessary to effect compliance, and set a specific date by which compliance shall be made.
145.08 HEARING AND REVOCATION.

The Commission may waive requirements when strict application would result in substantial hardship or injustice. The Commission may impose additional requirements for the establishment, development and construction of the park if the Commission determines such additional requirements are necessary for the welfare of the City and its occupants and/or the occupants of the park, to protect the area surrounding the park or to preserve the general intent and spirit of this chapter. The imposition of additional requirements may be appealed by the developer to the Board of Adjustment within five (5) days after
CHAPTER 145 MOBILE HOMES AND MOBILE HOME PARKS
imposition and the Board shall meet within ten (10) days after a written notice of appeal is filed with any Board member and the Board shall hear the appeal and enter an order sustaining, modifying or rescinding all or any part of the additional requirements.
21. After review of the master plan, as revised by the additional requirements of the Commission, if any, the Commission shall recommend approval to the Council or shall disapprove the master plan. If disapproved, the reasons therefor shall be set forth in the Commission’s minutes.
22. If recommended for approval, the master plan shall be forwarded to the Council at its next regular meeting. The Council shall consider the master plan and if the same is acceptable and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the Council shall approve and accept the same, or the master plan may be disapproved and the reasons therefor set forth in the minutes of the Council.
23. If approved and accepted by the Council, the developer may commence construction of the park in accordance with the master plan. During and upon completion of construction the Zoning Officer shall inspect the same to determine compliance with the master plan and with all other applicable statutes, ordinances and codes. If, upon inspection, the Zoning Officer finds noncompliance, said officer shall list the variances and give the list to the developer. The developer may appeal the listed variances to the Council in the same manner as provided in Section 145.08 and the Council shall hear the appeal and decide as provided in said section.
24. The Commission shall not recommend for approval and the Council shall not approve any master plan unless the property adjacent to the proposed mobile home park is adequately safeguarded, the plan is consistent with the intent and purposes of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and welfare and that the buildings in said proposed park shall be used for residential purposes only with the usual accessory uses.
25. A community shelter, defined as a stand-alone shelter that is designed and constructed to protect a number of people from a natural hazard event, shall be erected by the park owner when the sixth (6th) unit of the park is leased/rented.
145.10 STANDARDS FOR MOBILE HOMES. No mobile home shall be connected to water, sewer, fuel, gas or electrical service unless the mobile home complies with the standards and requirements prescribed by Standard for Mobile Homes, USAS A 119.1 1963, and amendments thereto, as published by the United States of America Standards Institute, as applicable, which publication is hereby adopted and by reference made a part of this chapter, a copy of which is and shall remain on file in the office of the City Clerk as part of the records of such office. Compliance with said standards shall be determined by the Zoning Officer. A certificate, if issued by the manufacturer of the mobile home, shall be permanently affixed on a readily visible location on the exterior of the mobile home as prima facie evidence of such compliance.
145.11 SKIRTING. A permanent type material of construction compatible with the design and color of the mobile home shall be installed to enclose the open space between the bottom of the mobile home side and the grade level of the mobile home stand and shall be so installed to provide substantial resistance to heavy winds. Skirting shall be maintained in an attractive manner consistent with the exterior of the mobile home to preserve the appearance of the mobile home and of the mobile home park. Sufficient screened ventilating area shall be installed in the skirting to supply the combustion requirements of heating units and ventilating of the mobile home. Provisions shall be made for easy removal of a section large enough to permit access for
CHAPTER 145 MOBILE HOMES AND MOBILE HOME PARKS
inspection of the enclosed area under the mobile home and for repair of sewer, water and utility connections.
145.12 REFUSE DISPOSAL. The storage, collection and disposal of refuse in a mobile home park shall be the responsibility of the mobile home park owner, and shall be conducted so as to create no health hazards, rodent harborage, insect breeding areas, accident or fire hazards, or air pollution.

113.03 OTHER ORDINANCES. The Grantee agrees to comply with the terms of any lawfully adopted generally applicable local ordinance, to the extent that the provisions of the ordinance do not have the effect of limiting the benefits or expanding the obligations of the Grantee that are granted by this franchise. Neither party may unilaterally alter the materials rights and obligations set forth in this franchise. In the event of a conflict between any ordinance and this franchise, the franchise shall control.
113.04 OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS. The Franchising Authority shall not permit any person to provide services similar to those provided by the Grantee in the service area without first having secured a non-exclusive franchise from the Franchising Authority. The Franchising Authority agrees that any grant of additional franchises or other authorizations including OVS authorizations by the Franchising Authority to provide services similar to those provided by the Grantee pursuant to this agreement to any other entity shall cover the entire service area and shall not be on terms and conditions more favorable or less burdensome to the grantee of any such additional franchise or other authorization than those which are set forth herein. In any renewal of the franchise, the Franchising Authority, should it seek to impose increased obligations upon the Grantee, must take into account any additional franchise(s) or authorizations previously granted and find that the proposed increased obligations in the renewal are not more burdensome and/or less favorable than those contained in any such additional franchise(s) or authorizations.
113.05 CONDITIONS OF OCCUPANCY. The cable system installed by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use of public ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who own property that adjoins any such public ways.
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
113.06 RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS. If during the course of Grantee’s construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system there occurs a disturbance of any public way by the Grantee, the Grantee shall replace and restore such public way to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition of the public way existing immediately prior to such disturbance.
113.07 RELOCATION FOR THE FRANCHISING AUTHORITY. Upon its receipt of reasonable advance written notice, to be not less than 10 business days, the Grantee shall protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way any property of the Grantee when lawfully required by the Franchising Authority by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street abandonment, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, gas or water pipes or any other type of public structures or improvements which are not used to compete with the Grantee’s services. The Grantee shall in all cases have the right of abandonment of its property.
113.08 RELOCATION FOR A THIRD PARTY. The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a lawful permit issued by the Franchising Authority, protect, support, raise, lower, temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from the public way as necessary any property of the Grantee, provided: (i) the expense of such is paid by the person benefiting from the relocation, including, if required by the Grantee, making such payment in advance; and (ii) the Grantee is given reasonable advance written notice to prepare for such changes. For purposes of this subsection, “reasonable advance written notice” shall be no less than 10 business days in the event of a temporary relocation, and no less than 120 days for a permanent relocation.
113.09 TRIMMING OF TREES AND SHRUBBERY. The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees or other natural growth in order to access and maintain the cable system.
113.10 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. Construction, operation and maintenance of the cable system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such work shall be performed in substantial accordance with generally applicable Federal, State and local regulations and the National Electric Safety Code.
113.11 UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION. In those areas of the service area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are underground, the Grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain all of its cable system underground. Nothing contained in this section shall require the Grantee to construct, operate and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances.
113.12 ACCESS TO OPEN TRENCHES. The Franchising Authority agrees to include the Grantee in the platting process for any new subdivision. At a minimum, the Franchising Authority agrees to require as a condition of issuing a permit for open trenching to any utility or developer that the utility or developer give the Grantee at least 10 days advance written notice of the availability of the open trench. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not be required to utilize any open trench.
113.13 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SYSTEM. Grantee agrees to provide cable service to all residences in the service area subject to the density requirements specified in this section. Whenever the Grantee receives a request for cable service from a potential subscriber in a unserved area contiguous to Grantee’s existing distribution facilities where there
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
are at least 10 residences within 1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) from the portion of the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for cable system extension, other than the published standard/non-standard installation fees charged to all subscribers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the service area where another operator is providing cable service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the present service area of the Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.
113.14 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SYSTEM. No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, if an area does not meet the density requirements of Section 113.13, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to subscriber(s) in that area if the subscriber(s) are willing to share the capital costs of extending the cable system. Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet from the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 10. Subscribers who request service hereunder will bear the remaining cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance. Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/non-standard installation charges to extend the cable system from the tap to the residence.
113.15 CABLE SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The Grantee, upon request, shall provide without charge a standard installation and one outlet of basic cable service to those administrative buildings owned or occupied by the Franchising Authority, fire station(s), police station(s), public library and K-12 public school(s) that are passed by its cable system. The cable service provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed outlet without authorization from the Grantee. The cable service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes and such outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public. The Franchising Authority shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any inappropriate use of the Grantee’s cable system or any loss or damage to Grantee’s cable system. The Franchising Authority shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of cable service required by this section. The Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a non-standard installation is required, unless the Franchising Authority or building owner/occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary cable system extension and/or non-standard installation. If additional outlets of basic cable are provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the usual installation and service fees associated therewith.
113.16 REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS. If funds are available to any person using the public way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the Franchising Authority shall reimburse the Grantee in the same manner in which other persons affected by the requirement are reimbursed. If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the Franchising Authority shall make application for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.
113.17 FRANCHISE FEE.
1. The Grantee shall pay to the Franchising Authority a franchise fee of 5% of quarterly gross revenues (as defined in Section 113.01 of this chapter). In accordance with the Cable Act, the 12 month period applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year. The franchise fee payment
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
shall be due quarterly and payable within 30 days after the close of the preceding calendar quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report prepared by a representative of the Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
2. Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for recovery by the Franchising Authority of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three years from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due to the Franchising Authority.
113.18 RATES AND CHARGES. The Franchising Authority may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable service and equipment as expressly permitted by Federal law.
113.19 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
1. The Franchising Authority and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the Franchising Authority that relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Federal law.
2. In addition to the procedures set forth in the Cable Act, the Franchising Authority agrees to notify the Grantee of all of its assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of the Grantee under the then current franchise term. The Franchising Authority further agrees that such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly so that the Grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal pursuant to the Cable Act and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its term.
3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that at any time during the term of the then current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to comment in accordance with the provisions of Federal law, the Franchising Authority and Grantee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise and the Franchising Authority may grant a renewal thereof.
4. The Grantee and the Franchising Authority consider the terms set forth in this section to be consistent with the express renewal provisions of the Cable Act.
113.20 CONDITIONS OF SALE. If a renewal or extension of Grantee’s franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the Franchising Authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act. The Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the franchise, the Grantee shall be given at least 12 months to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party. Furthermore, the Grantee shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise during this period. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably acceptable to the Franchising Authority, the Grantee and Franchising Authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to Federal or State law. It is further agreed that the Grantee’s continued operation of its cable system during the twelve-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the Franchising Authority or the Grantee.
113.21 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE. The Grantee’s right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without prior written notice to the Franchising Authority. No such notice shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title or interest of the Grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness.
113.22 PEG ACCESS. Grantee shall activate and assign one channel on the cable system to the full-time non-commercial transmission of public, education and governmental (PEG) programming to be determined and carried out at the sole discretion of the City. The City may request and the Grantee shall provide a second channel for the use of PEG programming but not until the City can demonstrate that the first channel assigned to PEG programming is used on an average of eight hours per day with not less than five hours each week being new programming. Upon reasonable request by the Grantee, the City shall provide a written report describing the use and programming of said PEG access channel or channels.
113.23 BOOKS AND RECORDS. The Grantee agrees that the Franchising Authority, upon 30 days written notice to the Grantee and no more than once annually, may review such of its books and records at the Grantee’s business office, during normal business hours and on a nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this franchise. Such notice shall specifically reference the section of the franchise which is under review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the Franchising Authority. Alternatively, if the books and records are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of the Franchising Authority’s representative to view the books and records at the appropriate location. The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three years. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate which is not providing cable service in the service area. The Franchising Authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
113.24 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. The Grantee shall maintain insurance in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the franchise, with liability coverage of $2,000,000. The Franchising Authority shall be designated as an additional insured and such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the Franchising Authority. Upon written request, the Grantee shall provide a Certificate of Insurance showing evidence of the coverage required by this section.
113.25 INDEMNIFICATION. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless and defend the Franchising Authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death) which arise out of the Grantee’s construction, operation or maintenance of its cable system in the service area, provided that the Franchising Authority shall give the Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify the Franchising Authority within 10 days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify the Franchising Authority for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of the Franchising Authority.
113.26 NOTICE OF VIOLATION. In the event that the Franchising Authority believes that the Grantee has not complied with any material term of the franchise, the Franchising Authority shall informally discuss the matter with Grantee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
of the problem, the Franchising Authority shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.
113.27 GRANTEE’S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND. The Grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in Section 113.26 to: (i) respond to the Franchising Authority contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the Franchising Authority of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
113.28 PUBLIC HEARING. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice as described in Section 113.26 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 113.27, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 30 days or the date projected pursuant to Section 113.27(iii) above, if it intends to continue its investigation into the default, then the Franchising Authority shall schedule a public hearing. The Franchising Authority shall provide the Grantee at least ten (10) days’ prior written notice of such hearing, which specifies the time, place and purpose of such hearing and provide the Grantee the opportunity to be heard.
113.29 ENFORCEMENT. Subject to applicable federal and State law, in the event the Franchising Authority, after the hearing set forth in 113.28, determines that the Grantee is in material default of any provision of the franchise, the Franchising Authority may:
1. Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or
2. In the case of repeated or ongoing substantial noncompliance with a material term or terms of the franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in accordance with Section 113.30.
113.30 REVOCATION. Should the Franchising Authority seek to revoke the franchise after following the procedures set forth in Sections 113.26 – 113.29, the Franchising Authority shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the repeated or ongoing substantial noncompliance with a material term or terms of the franchise. The Grantee shall have 90 days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the Franchising Authority has not received a satisfactory response from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public meeting. The Franchising Authority shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least 30 days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to revoke the franchise. At the designated hearing, Grantee shall be provided a fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to be represented by legal counsel, to introduce relevant evidence, to require the production of evidence, to compel the relevant testimony of the officials, agents, employees or consultants of the Franchising Authority, to compel the testimony of other persons as permitted by law, and to question witnesses. A complete verbatim record and transcript shall be made of such hearing. Following the hearing, the Franchising Authority shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. If the Franchising Authority determines that the franchise shall be revoked, the Franchising Authority shall promptly provide Grantee with its decision in writing. The Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the Franchising Authority de novo. Grantee shall be entitled to such relief as the court finds appropriate. Such appeal must be taken within 60 days of the Grantee’s receipt of the determination of the Franchising Authority. The Franchising Authority may, at its sole
CHAPTER 113 CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the Franchising Authority’s rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.
113.31 FORCE MAJEURE. The Grantee shall not be held in default under or in noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the Grantee to anticipate and control. This provision includes work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which Grantee’s cable system is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the Franchising Authority’s intention to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of the franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the subscribers within the service area, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the Grantee which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the Franchising Authority and/or subscribers.
113.32 ACTIONS OF PARTIES. In any action by the Franchising Authority or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
113.33 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This franchise constitutes the entire agreement between the Grantee and the Franchising Authority and supersedes all other prior understandings and agreements oral or written. Any amendments to this franchise shall be mutually agreed to in writing by the parties.
113.34 RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Acceptance of the terms and conditions of this franchise will not constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a waiver, either expressly or impliedly, by Grantee of any constitutional or legal right which it may have or may be determined to have, either by subsequent legislation or court decisions. The Franchising Authority acknowledges that Grantee reserves all of its rights under applicable Federal and State Constitutions and laws.
113.35 NOTICE. Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response required by this franchise to be served upon the Franchising Authority or the Grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party when placed in a properly sealed and correctly addressed envelope: a) upon receipt when hand delivered with receipt/acknowledgment, b) upon receipt when sent certified, registered mail, c) within five business days after having been posted in the regular mail, or d) the next business day if sent by express mail or overnight air courier.

A. “Emergency errand” means, but is not limited to, an errand relating to a fire, a natural disaster, an automobile accident or any other situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious illness, bodily injury, or loss of life.
B. “Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility through an objective test. It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
C. “Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
D. “Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area, such as a lobby, office or interrogation room that is not designed, set aside, or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
E. “Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned, that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
CHAPTER 46 MINORS
F. “Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have custody or control of a minor.
G. “Unemancipated” means unmarried and/or still under the custody or control of a responsible adult.

If a minor is issued a citation to appear for a violation of this section, a law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible as soon as possible, within 24 hours of the violation.

13. Untreatable Wastes. Waters or wastes containing substances that are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
97.05 RESTRICTED DISCHARGES; POWERS OF SUPERINTENDENT. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in Section 97.04 and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
1. Rejection. Reject the wastes by requiring disconnection from the public sewage system;
2. Pretreatment. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
3. Controls Imposed. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

97.07 CONTROL MANHOLES. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner’s expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
97.08 TESTING OF WASTES. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples).

165.31 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
1. Purpose. The purpose of Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations is to encourage flexibility in the design and development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets, utilities and public spaces; and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open areas. The procedure is intended to permit diversification in the location of structures and improve circulation facilities and other site qualities while ensuring adequate standards relating to public health, safety and welfare and convenience both in the use and occupancy of buildings and facilities in planned groups. A planned unit development to be eligible under this chapter must be:
A. In accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the City and with the regulations of this chapter;
B. An effective and unified means of treating possible development providing for preservation of scenic features and amenities of the site and the surrounding area;
C. So designed in its space allocation, orientation, landscaping, circulation system, materials and other features as to produce an environment of stable and desirable character, complementing the design and values of the neighborhood.
2. Tract and Land Use.
A. Minimum Area. A planned unit development shall include no less than two (2) acres.
B. Open Space. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of planned unit site area shall be developed as open space. Parking areas and vehicle access facilities shall not be considered in calculating open space.
C. Land Use. All of the PUD site exclusive of open space shall be devoted to those uses permitted in the zone district in which the PUD is located. In the Agriculture or R-1 District, at least fifty percent (50%) of the dwelling units shall be single family detached units. Proposed land uses shall not adversely affect surrounding development, and shall be in accordance with the objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
D. Unity of Control. In order that the purpose of these regulations may be realized, the land and buildings and appurtenant facilities shall be in single ownership, or under management or supervision of a central authority, or otherwise subject to such supervisory lease or ownership control as may be necessary to carry out the provisions herein.
3. Application Procedures. Planned Unit Developments shall be subject to the approval of the Council based upon review and recommendations by the Commission.
A. General Development Plan. The applicant shall file a General Development Plan which shall include the following information:
(1) A statement describing the general character of other intended development;
(2) An accurate map of the project area including its relationship to surrounding properties, existing topography and key features;
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
(3) A plan of the proposed project showing sufficient information to make possible the evaluation of the criteria for approval;
(4) Appropriate statistical data on the size of the development, expected staging and any other plans or data pertinent to evaluation by the City; and
(5) A general outline of intended organizational structure related to property owners association, deed restrictions and private provision of common services.
B. Specific Implementation Plan. A specific and detailed plan for implementation of all or a part of a proposed PUD after approval of the General Development Plan must be submitted within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Council. The specific implementation plan shall be submitted for review by the Commission and approval or disapproval by the Council and shall include such information and documentation as shall be required by the Commission or the Council to adequately and fully explain the plan.
4. Criteria for Approval. As a basis for determining the acceptability of a PUD application, the Council shall determine whether the General Development Plan is consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter, has been prepared with competent professional advice and guidance and produces significant benefits in terms of environmental design. The Council may also consider the compatibility of land uses within and without the PUD; the compatibility of the General Development Plan with the City’s Comprehensive Plan; the effects on traffic, schools and municipal services and the economic feasibility of the plan relative to the City’s economy. The proponents of a PUD shall submit a reasonable schedule for the implementation of the development to the satisfaction of the Council including suitable provisions for assurance that each phase can be brought to completion in a manner which will not result of termination at that point.
5. Approval. Following a review of all of the proposed PUD plans as required herein, the Commission shall recommend to the Council that the PUD be approved as submitted, approved with modifications or disapproved. Upon receipt of the Commission recommendation, the Council may approve the plan and authorize the development to proceed accordingly or disapprove the plan. Any subsequent change or addition to the plans or use shall first be submitted for approval to the Council and if such change or addition constitutes a substantial alteration of the original plan, the procedures in the above shall be required. If construction of the PUD does not commence and continue in reasonable accordance with the development schedule, then the PUD shall be voided.

The Board may, by concurring vote of three (3) members, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions and intent of this chapter, affirm or reverse, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Administrative Officer.
2. To authorize upon appeal from any action of the Zoning Administrative Officer such variance from the requirements of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions and circumstances, a literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the requirements of this chapter shall not be granted unless all of the following conditions are met:
A. Special conditions and circumstances are shown to exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district.
B. Literal interpretation of the requirements of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this chapter.
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
C. The special conditions and circumstances relied upon do not result from the actions of the applicant.
D. Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district.
A nonconforming use of lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district or a permitted use of land, structures or buildings in other zoning districts shall not be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. In granting a variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the requirements and spirit of this chapter. Violations of any of such conditions, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter subject to the provisions of Sections 165.35 and 165.36. If a variance is granted by the concurring vote of three (3) members, the Board shall make a finding that the special conditions and circumstances set forth in the notice of appeal justify the granting thereof and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, structure or building involved and that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
165.39 APPEALS FROM THE BOARD. Any person, including but not limited to the Zoning Administrative Officer, aggrieved by any decision or action of the Board of Adjustment may seek review thereof by a court of record in the manner provided by law, particularly Chapter 414, Code of Iowa.
165.40 AMENDMENTS. This chapter and the districts created thereby may be amended from time to time. No amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by, or shall have been first submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation. The Commission shall have twenty-five (25) days after Council action referring a proposed amendment to it in which to submit its report and recommendations to the Council. If the Commission fails to submit a report within the 25-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed amendment. A public hearing pursuant to law shall be held by the Council before adoption of any proposed amendment to this chapter. If the Commission does not approve the proposed amendment or if a protest is filed with the Council against a change in district boundaries, which protest is signed by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed change, or of those immediately adjacent in the rear thereof extending the depth of one (1) lot or not to exceed two hundred (200) feet therefrom, or of those directly opposite thereto, extending the depth of one (1) lot or not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of at least three-fourths (3/4) of all members of the Council.
165.41 APPLICATION FOR CHANGE IN DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. Any person may submit an application in writing to the Council requesting a change in the zoning district boundaries as shown on the Official Zoning Map. Such application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrative Officer accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) (failure to approve the requested change shall not be deemed cause to refund such fee) and shall contain the following information:
1. The legal description and, if applicable, the local address of the property for which the district change is requested.
CHAPTER 165 ZONING REGULATIONS
2. The present zoning classification and the zoning classification requested.
3. The existing use and the proposed use of the property.
4. The names and addresses of the owners of all property within two hundred (200) feet of the property for which the change is requested.

6. A plat or reasonably accurate sketch showing existing and proposed locations, dimensions and use of all property within two hundred (200) feet of the proposed change, including streets, alleys, railroads and other physical features.
The Zoning Administrative Officer shall immediately forward a copy of the application to the Commission for study and recommendation. Prior to making a recommendation, the Commission shall determine the following: (a) whether the current district classification of the property sought to be changed is valid and consistent with current use, the Comprehensive Plan and reasonably ascertainable future needs of the City; (b) whether there is a need for additional land zoned for the purpose requested; and (c) whether the proposed change is consistent with the current land use plan, considering such factors as: (a) effect on population density or development which would in turn cause a demand for services and utilities in excess of the capacity planned for the area; (b) effect on traffic relative to existing and planned streets in the vicinity; and (c) the applicant’s intent and capability for diligent and timely development of the property. The Commission shall within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the application report in detail its determinations and recommendation to the Council. If the Commission fails to submit a report within such time, the application will be deemed approved by the Commission.

Improvements will be accepted only after their construction in strict conformity with the requirements of the Council has been completed. No public funds shall be expended in the subdivision until such improvements have been completed and accepted by the City.
166.14 VARIANCES. Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision, it can be shown that strict compliance with the requirement of this chapter would result in extraordinary hardship to the subdivider, because of unusual topography or other conditions, the Council may vary, modify or waive the requirements so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Provided, however, such variance, modification or waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. In no case shall any variance or modification be more than minimum easing of the requirements and in no instance shall it be in conflict with
CHAPTER 166 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
the Zoning Ordinance and such variance and waivers may be granted only by the affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the Council.

2. Findings of Fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community.
B. These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by: (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
3. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in paragraph 2(A) of this section with provisions designed to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities.
CHAPTER 167 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement.
C. Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.
D. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.
167.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all areas having special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of Belmond. For the purpose of this chapter, the special flood hazard areas are those areas designated as Zone A on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Wright County and Incorporated Areas, City of Belmond, Panels 19197C0160C, 0180C, dated February 20, 2013, which is hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter.
2. The boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the official Flood Insurance Rate Map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the City Manager or Zoning Administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.

167.05 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT STANDARDS. All uses must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and meet the following applicable performance standards. Where base flood elevations have not been provided in the Flood Insurance Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to determine: (i) whether the land involved is either wholly or partly within the floodway or floodway fringe; and (ii) the 100 year flood level. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determination. Review by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources is not required for the proposed construction of new or replacement bridges or culverts where: (i) the bridge or culvert is located on a stream that drains less than 100 square miles; and (ii) the bridge or culvert is not associated with a channel modification that constitutes a channel change as specified in 567-71.2(1)b, Iowa Administrative Code.
1. All Development. All development within the special flood hazard areas shall:
A. Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
B. Use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage.
C. Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to flood damage.
D. Obtain all other necessary permits from federal, state and local governmental agencies including approval when required from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
2. Residential Structures. All new or substantially improved residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevations. Construction shall be upon compacted fill which shall, at all points, be no lower than one foot above the base flood elevations and extend at such elevation at least 18 feet beyond the limits of any structure erected thereon. Alternate methods of elevating (such as piers or extended foundations) may be allowed, subject to favorable consideration by the City Council, where existing topography, street grades, or other factors preclude elevating by fill. In such cases, the methods used must be adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces and hazards associated with flooding. All new residential structures located in areas that would become isolated due to flooding of surrounding ground shall be provided with a means of access that will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the base flood. However, this criterion shall not apply where the Administrator determines there is sufficient flood warning time for the protection of life and property. When estimating flood warning time, consideration shall be given to the criteria listed in 567-75.2(3), Iowa Administrative Code.
3. Nonresidential Structures. All new or substantially improved nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be flood proofed to such a level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure,
CHAPTER 167 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Administrator.
4. All New and Substantially Improved Structures.
A. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (not including basements) that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(1) A minimum of two openings, with positioning on at least two walls, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
(2) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
(3) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Such areas shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access and low damage potential storage.
B. New and substantially improved structures must be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
C. New and substantially improved structures must be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities elevated or flood proofed to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation.
5. Factory-Built Homes:
A. All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the structure is a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level.
B. All new and substantially improved factory-built homes, including those placed in existing factory-built home parks or subdivisions, shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. Anchorage systems may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors as required by the State Building Code.
6. Utility and Sanitary Systems.
A. On-site waste disposal and water supply systems shall be located or designed to avoid impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
CHAPTER 167 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
B. All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system as well as the discharge of effluent into flood waters. Wastewater treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of flood protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
C. New or replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. Water supply treatment facilities (other than on-site systems) shall be provided with a level of protection equal to or greater than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation.
D. Utilities such as gas or electrical systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage to the system and the risk associated with such flood damaged or impaired systems.
7. Storage of Materials and Equipment. Storage of equipment and materials that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. Other material and equipment must either be similarly elevated or: (i) not subject to major flood damage and be anchored to prevent movement due to flood waters; or (ii) readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
8. Flood Control Structures. Flood control structural works such as levees, flood walls, etc. shall provide, at a minimum, protection from the base flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and shall provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood control works shall be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
9. Watercourse Alterations. Watercourse alterations or relocations must be designed to maintain the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion. In addition, such alterations or relocations must be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.
10. Subdivisions. Subdivisions (including factory-built home parks and subdivisions) shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. Development associated with subdivision proposals (including the installation of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance standards of this chapter. Subdivision proposals intended for residential use shall provide all lots with a means of access which will be passable by wheeled vehicles during the 100-year flood. Proposals for subdivisions greater than five acres or 50 lots (whichever is less) shall include 100-year flood elevation data for those areas located within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
11. Accessory Structures to Residential Uses. Detached garages, sheds, and similar structures that are incidental to a residential use are exempt from the base flood elevation requirements where the following criteria are satisfied.
A. The structure shall be designed to have low flood damage potential. Its size shall not exceed 600 square feet in size. Those portions of the structure located less than one foot above the BFE must be constructed of flood-resistant materials.
CHAPTER 167 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
B. The structure shall be used solely for low flood damage potential purposes such as vehicle parking and limited storage. The structure shall not be used for human habitation.
C. The structure shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
D. The structure shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
E. The structure’s service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be elevated or floodproofed to at least one foot above the base flood elevation.
F. The structure’s walls shall include openings that satisfy the provisions of subsection 4(A) of this section.
Exemption from the 100-year flood elevation requirements for such a structure may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage of the structure and its contents.
12. Recreational Vehicles.
A. Recreational vehicles are exempt from the requirements of subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes when the following criteria are satisfied.
(1) The recreational vehicle shall be located on the site for less than 180 consecutive days; and
(2) The recreational vehicle must be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system and is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
B. Recreational vehicles that are located on the site for more than 180 consecutive days or are not ready for highway use must satisfy requirements of subsection 5 of this section regarding anchoring and elevation of factory-built homes.
13. Pipeline Crossings. Pipeline river and stream crossings shall be buried in the streambed and banks, or otherwise sufficiently protected to prevent rupture due to channel degradation and meandering.
14. Maximum Damage Potential Uses. All new or substantially improved maximum damage potential uses shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated a minimum of one foot above the elevation of the 500-year flood, or together with attendant utility and sanitary systems, be floodproofed to such a level. When flood proofing is utilized, a professional engineer registered in the State of Iowa shall certify that the flood proofing methods used are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood; and that the structure, below the base flood elevation is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. A record of the certification indicating the specific elevation (in relation to North American Vertical Datum 1988) to which any structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the Administrator. Where 0.2% chance flood elevation data has not been provided in the Flood Insurance
CHAPTER 167 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
Study, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shall be contacted to compute such data. The applicant will be responsible for providing the Department of Natural Resources with sufficient technical information to make such determinations.
167.06 ESTABLISHMENT OF VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
1. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.
A. Variances shall only be granted upon: (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances.
B. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the 100-year flood would result. Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.
C. Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
D. In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Administrator that: (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.
E. All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the Department of Natural Resources.
2. Factors upon Which the Decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment Shall Be Based. In passing upon applications for variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:
A. The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments.
B. The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream to the injury of others.
C. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
D. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
E. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the City.
CHAPTER 167 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
F. The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.
G. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use.
H. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
I. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for the area.
J. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
K. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.
L. The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges.
M. Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter.
3. Conditions Attached to Variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
A. Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities.
B. Limitation of periods of use and operation.
C. Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.
D. Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving the purpose of this chapter.
E. Floodproofing measures shall be designed consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area, flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, and other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The Council shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document certified by a registered professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and associated flood factors for the particular area.
167.07 NONCONFORMING USES.
1. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following conditions:
A. If such use is discontinued for six consecutive months, any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter.
B. Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
CHAPTER 167 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
2. If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, unless it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued designation.
167.08 PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION. Violations of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of the requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $(500.00 (five hundred dollars) or imprisoned for not more than (thirty (30) days. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.
167.09 AMENDMENTS. The regulations and standards set forth in this chapter may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed. No amendment, supplement, change, or modification shall be undertaken without prior approval of the Department of Natural
