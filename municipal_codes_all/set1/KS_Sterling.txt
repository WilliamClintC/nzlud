ARTICLE 3. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS

16-301.      Statutory authorization, findings of fact, and purposes

(a)   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION

(1)   Approval of Draft Ordinance by Kansas Chief Engineer Prior to Adoption

       The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form by the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department of Agriculture on January 5, 2009.

(2)   Kansas Statutory Authorization

       The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et set, and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the governing body of the City of Sterling, Kansas ordains as follows:

(b)   FINDINGS OF FACT

(1)   Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation

       The special flood hazard areas of the City of Sterling, Kansas, are subject to inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(2)   General Causes of the Flood Losses

       These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

(3)   Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards

       The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards, which consist of a series of interrelated steps.

(A)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods, which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in anyone year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated September 3, 1997 as amended, and any future revisions thereto.

(B)  Calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood.

(C)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point.

(D)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.

(E)   Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood.

(c)   Statement of Purpose

It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 16-301(b)(l); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) and K;A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions of this article to:

(1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;

(2)   Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and

(3)   Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

(Ord. 2409; Code 2014)

16-302.      General provisions.

(a)   Lands to which article applies

This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction the City of Sterling identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones, AE, AO, and AH Zones on the Index Map dated September 3, 1997 of the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the City of Sterling or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the City of Sterling or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in section 16-304.

(b)   Compliance

No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.

(c)   Abrogation and greater restrictions

It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

(d)   Interpretation

In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Kansas statutes.

(e)   Warning and disclaimer of liability

The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Sterling, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.

(f)   Severability

If any section; clause; provision; or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected thereby.

(Ord. 2409; Code 2014)

16-303.      Administration.

(a)   Floodplain

A floodplain development permit shall be required for all proposed construction or other development, including the placement of manufactured homes, in the areas described in section 16-302(a). No person, firm, corporation, or unit of government shall initiate any development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate floodplain development permit for each structure or other development.

(b)   Designation of floodplain administrator

The Sterling City Manager is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article.

The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.

(d)   Areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH zones)

Located within the areas of special flood hazard as described in section 16-302(a) are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does riot exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply:

(1)   AO Zones

(A)  All new construction and substantial-improvements of residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified).

(B)  All new construction and substantial-improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community FIRM (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified) or together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be completely flood proofed to that level so that · the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.

(C)  Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes, in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

(2)   AH Zones

(A)  The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation has been provided shall be required as set forth in section 16-304(b).

(e)   Floodway

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-302(a), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:

(1)   The community shall select and adopt a regulatory flood way based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point.

(2)   The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(3)   If section 16-304(e) (2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 16-304(e).

(4)   In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State, or other sources as set forth in section 16-304(a) (2).

(f)   Recreational vehicles

As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(2)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, repair, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination, provide the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

(3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any significant increase in flood discharge would result.

(4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(5)   Variances shall only be issued upon: (a) showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(6)   A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that: (a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (b) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article.

101 Purpose. These regulations are intended to serve the following purposes:
A. To promote the public health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare and to protect and control the aesthetics of new development or redevelopment;
B. To establish a variety of zoning district classifications according to the use of land and buildings with varying intensities of uses and standards whose interrelationships of boundary zones form a compatible pattern of land uses and buffer areas which enhance the value of each zone;
C. To regulate and restrict the location, use and appearance of buildings, structures and land within each district and to zone for residential, commercial, industrial and other purposes including floodplains;
D. To regulate and restrict the height, number of stories and size of buildings and structures including their distance from any street or highway; the percentage of each lot that may be occupied by buildings and other structures; and size of yards, courts and other open spaces;

F. To provide for adequate light and air and acceptable noise levels;

ARTICLE 2. INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS
100 Rules of Interpretation.
A. Minimum Requirements. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare.
B. Overlapping or Contradictory Regulations. Where the conditions imposed by the provisions of these regulations upon the use of land or structures are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
C. Private Agreements. The provisions of these regulations are not intended to abrogate any valid easement, deed restriction, covenant or other private agreement of legal relationship; provided, that where the requirements of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such private agreements, the requirements of these regulations shall govern. The City does not have a responsibility to enforce such private agreements.
D. Unlawful Uses. No use of land or structure which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations shall become or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of these regulations; and to the extent that, and in any respect that, said unlawful use or structure is in conflict with the requirements of these regulations, said use or structure remains unlawful hereunder.
E. Not a Licensing Regulation. Nothing contained in these regulations shall be deemed to be a consent, license or permit to use any property or to locate, construct or maintain any structure or facility or to carry on any trade, industry, occupation or activity.
F. Effect on Existing Permits. For all purposes, except single-family residential developments platted and recorded after January 1, 1992, nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to require any change in plans, construction or designated use of any land or structure in the event that: (See Section 2-100G for Vesting of Development Rights.)
1. A zoning permit for such use of land or structure was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of these regulations or the effective date of any amendment thereof; and
2. Such permit had not by its own terms expired prior to such effective date; and

All rights reserved.
3. Such permit were issued on the basis of an application showing complete plans for proposed construction and/or use; and
4. There has been a substantial change of position, substantial expenditure, substantial work performed or incurrence of substantial obligations by the permit holder in reliance on such permit other than purchase of land or preparation of design plans; and
5. Such issuance of a permit and change of position, expenditures, work or incurrence of obligations were made prior to the effective date of an amendment of these regulations which amendments would have made illegal the issuance of such permit; and
6. Construction pursuant to such permit is completed prior to the expiration of such permit; and
7. When the use of land or a structure is completed under a permit to which this Section 2-100F applies, an occupancy certificate shall be issued in accordance with the zoning regulations in effect at the time the zoning permit was issued.
G. Vesting of Development Rights. For the purpose of single-family residential developments according to K.S.A. 12-764, as amended, development rights in such land use shall vest upon recording of a final plat of such land after January 1, 1992. If construction of a principal structure is not commenced on such land within five years of recording a final plat before July 01, 2009, the development rights in such land shall expire and, thus, all revisions to zoning or subdivision regulations becoming effective during the period vested shall then apply to such platted land. For such plats recorded on or after July 01, 2009, such construction must take place within 10 years to be vested.

ACCESSORY USE OR STRUCTURE: As defined in Article 6.
ADULT CARE CENTER: A facility in which care and activities are provided on an hourly or daily basis for adults of all ages. The latter arrangement is not construed to be a "nursing home". It may also be referred to as an "adult day care" facility. Such centers are licensed under regulations established and administered by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. (See Section 6-102C1 for adult care center limitations as home occupation.)

Standards for such definitions may be periodically amended by changes in state regulations. Application to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be made for a conditional use to allow up to 10 persons to be cared for in a home occupation.
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT: (See SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS.)
AGRICULTURE: (Inside the City) The use of land for growing crops in the open, horticulture, nurseries, truck farms and accessory uses, including the structures not in a designated floodplain for carrying out agricultural operations; provided, however, such agricultural use shall not include the following uses: (See Section 3-100E4 for Exemptions.)

3. The feeding of garbage to animals.
4. The feeding, grazing, or sheltering of domestic animals or fowl, e.g., horses, cows, swine, goats, chickens, pigeons, rabbits or fur bearing animals, but not including cats and dogs and other pets; unless such animals or fowl are otherwise permitted by the City laws or regulations.
5. The operation or maintenance of a stockyard or commercial feedlot.
Farmhouses are considered to be single-family dwellings.
AGRICULTURE: (Land outside the City) The use of a tract of land in excess of three acres under one ownership where the principal activity is to produce income from the growing of crops, horticulture, nurseries, truck farms or the raising of fish, poultry and cattle or other livestock, but not including feedlots. Such definition includes the structures which are not in a designated floodplain that are necessary for carrying on farming operations including greenhouses and, as an accessory use, the dwelling of the owner or operator of the premises including modular and manufactured or mobile homes used as the principal farm dwelling. The retail sale of items on the property produced as part of the farming operation is permitted. Such definition shall not include lands used for recreational purposes or rural home sites whose primary purpose is for residential use and not the production of income from a farming operation. Privately owned natural wildlife habitats and reserves are also considered an agricultural use.
So long as such land, related structures and accessory dwelling(s) are used for such bona fide agricultural purposes, these regulations do not require a zoning permit or an occupancy certificate, nor do they establish any other rule or regulation contrary to the provisions of K.S.A. 12-715b. nor assist the Zoning Administrator in determining if a proposed building, structure or use meets the definition of agriculture, any applicant seeking agricultural exempt status may be asked to complete a certificate of compliance. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Administrator in interpreting the definition of agriculture may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination. Surrounding nonagricultural landowners should be aware that Kansas is a "right-to-farm" state under K.S.A. 2-3201, et seq. which limits nuisance suits and injunctions if an agricultural activity is being conducted in conformity with federal, state and local laws. (See definition for FEEDLOT, Section 3-100E4 for Exemptions to agricultural purposes and Section 3-103N6 for a manufactured home as an accessory use to agricultural land as a conditional use.)

100 Activities Governed by these Regulations.
A. New Structures All structures built hereafter shall comply with all of the provisions of these regulations. Any structure hereafter moved from one site to another site shall be considered to be a structure built hereafter. Any structure rebuilt or restored after damage, by any means, shall be considered to be a structure built hereafter, unless Article 8 of these regulations permits such structures to be rebuilt or restored. (See Section 2-102 for definition of STRUCTURE.)
B. New Uses of Old Structures. If a use of any structure is hereafter changed to another, then the new use must comply with the use regulations of these regulations, unless permitted by provisions in Article 8. The mere establishment of the new use does not require an existing structure to conform to the lot size requirements or the bulk regulations.
C. Structural Alterations. If any structure is hereafter structurally altered as defined in Section 2-102:
1. The entire structure as altered shall comply with the use regulations of these regulations.
2. Any alterations, enlargements or additions to the structure shall comply with the bulk regulations of these regulations, except as permitted by Section 8-102B for nonconforming structures.
3. The off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced below or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements applicable to a similar new structure or use.
D. Uses of Open Land. If any use of open land is hereafter established or if any use of open land is hereafter changed to another use, such new use shall comply with all the provisions of these regulations, unless permitted by Sections 8-103 and 106.

5. Drilling and operation of oil and gas wells outside the City.
101 Districts, Zoning Maps and Boundaries.
A. Establishment of Districts. The zoning jurisdiction is hereby divided into the districts as described in Article 4. References to "agricultural districts" shall mean those districts in which agricultural uses are the predominant activity. References to "residential districts" shall mean those districts in which residential uses are the main permitted use. References to "business districts" shall mean those districts in which commercial uses are the main permitted uses. References to "industrial districts" shall mean those districts in which industrial uses are the main permitted use. The Floodplain Management Regulations in the Appendix are considered as an overlay zone to be used in conjunction with the other districts.
B. Zoning Maps.
1. The boundaries of the districts described in Article 4 are as indicated on the Official Zoning Map(s) which is on file with the Zoning Administrator and identified on its face as part of these regulations. The zoning map(s) with all notations, references and other matters shown thereon is as much a part of these regulations as if specifically set forth herein. (See Section 9-100A9 for zoning map(s) certificate and revisions.)
2. It is the intent of these regulations that the entire area of the zoning jurisdiction, including all the land and water areas, rivers, streets, alleys and railroads and other rights of way, be included in the districts established in these regulations. Any area not shown on the zoning map(s) as being included in any district shall be deemed to be in the most restrictive district.

All rights reserved.
C. Boundaries. In the event that uncertainties exist with respect to the intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning map(s), the following rules shall apply:
1. Where boundary lines are indicated as approximately following roads, streets, alleys, easements, railroads, rivers, streams or lakes, such boundaries shall be construed as following the centerlines thereof, unless otherwise indicated.
2. Where boundary lines are indicated as approximately following lot lines; or section, half-section or quarter-section lines; such lines shall be construed to be said boundaries.
3. Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of boundaries as stated in Sections 3-101C1 or 2 above, the district boundaries shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map, unless an exact distance is shown.
D. Zoning of Rights of Way. All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways and railroad rights of way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting them. Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway or railroad right of way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.
102 General Requirements for All Zoning Districts.
A. Permitted Uses. No structure shall hereafter be built, moved or structurally altered and no structure or land shall hereafter be used, occupied or designed for use or occupancy except for a use that is permitted within the zoning district in which the structure or land is located or provided for otherwise in these regulations.

B. Special Uses. No use of a structure or land that is designated as a special use in any zoning district shall hereafter be established, and no existing special use shall hereafter be changed to another special use in such district, unless a special use is approved in the same manner as for an amendment to a zoning district, except that the Official Map is not amended. The latter procedure is set forth in Section 11-101 with the additional requirement that all conditions further imposed upon the special use be made a part of the effectuating ordinance. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SPECIAL USE.)
C. Conditional Uses. No use of a structure or land that is designated as a conditional use in any zoning district shall hereafter be established, and no existing conditional use shall hereafter be changed to another conditional use in such district, unless a conditional use as an exception is approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided for in Section 10-108.

3. No part of the lot area, or of the yard, other open space, or off-street parking or loading space provided in connection with any structure or use (including but not limited to, any structure or use existing on the effective date of these regulations or of any amendment thereof) shall be subsequently reduced below, or further reduced if already less than, the minimum requirements of these regulations for the equivalent new construction.
F. Permitted Obstructions in Required Yards. The following shall not be considered to be obstructions when located in a required yard: (See Section 9-101A3 for principal or accessory buildings or structures or uses locating on or projecting over public easements.)
1. In all yards: Open terraces or patios not over four feet above the average level of the adjoining ground, but not including a permanent roof over a terrace or patio; awnings; canopies including underlying islands for petroleum pumps; steps four feet or less above grade which are necessary for access to a permanent structure or for access to a lot or to a lot from a street or alley including access to conform to the standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as incorporated into state statutes; fire escapes, one story bay windows and overhanging eaves and gutters projecting 24 inches or less into the yard; chimneys, entrance hoods, window wells and daylight windows projecting 24 inches or less into the yard; arbors and trellises; flagpoles and basketball goals; ornamental light or gas fixtures; parking, when permitted by Article 5; accessory and temporary uses, when permitted by Article 6; signs, when permitted by Article 7; and when otherwise specifically permitted by the district regulations.

Rezoning may also be considered during the process of annexation. While the Planning Commission may hold their required public hearing on a rezoning amendment or a special use prior to annexation, the zoning ordinance of the Governing Body approving the amendment or special use cannot be effectuated until the land is first officially annexed by a separate annexation ordinance. While both ordinances may be published on the same day, the annexation ordinance must be published first if they are published on separate days.
J. Sewer and Water Facilities. All principal structures built hereafter within the city limits and on adjacent zoning lots shall be served by and connected to the City's sewer and water system, if such facilities can be feasibly provided as may be determined by the Governing Body.

All rights reserved.
K. Dedication of Rights of Way and Easements. As a condition related to a rezoning amendment or a special use, the dedication of additional street rights of way; easements for utilities, drainage, access control, fire lanes, building setback lines and other purposes; and the construction, removal or replacement of public improvements necessary to the proper development of the property, may be required either by platting or replatting the land according to the City Subdivision Regulations or, in lieu of platting, by a legal document effectuating such dedications and improvements. Such condition may be required whether the property is being divided or held in single ownership. A stated time limit not exceeding one year may be established to ensure compliance with the above conditions during which time the effectuation of the zoning amendment or special use having been approved with such conditions by the Governing Body shall be withheld from publication by the Clerk. Failure to comply with the conditions during the stated period shall result in making the zoning amendment or special use null and void. No extension of the time period may be granted without reapplication.
L. Floodplain Requirements. Within any floodplain area as delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, no use of land shall commence or no structure shall hereafter be constructed, structurally altered, extended, enlarged or moved under these regulations, unless it also complies with the floodplain regulations. (See Appendix for Floodplain Management Regulations.)
M. Moving Structures. No structure shall be moved into, nor from one location to another location within the zoning jurisdiction, unless such structure shall, when relocated, be made to conform fully with these regulations and applicable City building codes. No zoning permit shall be issued unless, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, the height, age, architectural style and texture of the materials pertaining to the outward appearance of such structure reasonably conform to other buildings in the block to which it is to be moved and in the block opposite or to surrounding land owners in the rural area, to such an extent that its relocation shall not be detrimental to the appearance or have no substantial adverse effect on property values to the adjacent properties.
N. Status of Moving Manufactured and Mobile Homes and RV Campers. Notwithstanding other provisions of these regulations, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a zoning permit for various types of manufactured and mobile homes and RV campers under the following provisions; except, that all such homes must meet the floodplain district requirements and none may be replaced in a floodway overlay boundary:
1. Wherever a manufactured or mobile home is moved from a zoning lot within a district in which it is a permitted use or exempted from these regulations in an agricultural district, another manufactured or mobile home meeting the requirements of the district may be moved onto the lot at any time.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 3-10
All rights reserved.
2. In the case of a lawful, nonconforming manufactured or mobile home use, such a move must take place within six months from the date that the previous home was moved off the lot, otherwise such use shall not thereafter be re-established and, when so moved in, shall be skirted or placed on a permanent-type enclosed perimeter foundation within 60 days. The replacement must be a manufactured home type only and not more than 10 years old. In re-establishing such a home use, any existing nonconforming lot size requirements or bulk regulations shall not be increased in nonconformity and no newly acquired land can be used for placement of such a home. Lawful, nonconforming mobile homes would not be allowed to be replaced if they are moved off their lot unless they were agriculturally exempt.
3. No manufactured or mobile home, or portion thereof, shall be moved onto any lot or parcel or an existing home converted for storage or any other purpose than for a residence in any district and no such home shall be temporarily or permanently located in any district not otherwise permitting such homes. These provisions do not preclude the use of prefabricated mobile structures designed for offices in business or industrial districts, but not manufactured or mobile homes unless specifically permitted.
4. In the event of disasters, such as fires, tornados or floods, whereby expediency is an important factor, a manufactured home or RV camper may be located temporarily in any district at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator with appropriate conditions attached and for a stated period of time.
5. Where an unusual hardship is shown, the Board of Zoning Appeals may approve a conditional use as an exception for a manufactured home or a RV camper as an accessory use to be located on a lot or tract with an existing dwelling for a stated period of time. A time period may be extended upon request to the Board of Zoning Appeals without further notice or fee.
6. As an accessory use to a principal farm dwelling on agricultural land as defined herein for outside the City, application may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use for locating a manufactured home with such an existing dwelling for additional assistance on the farm or ranch. A certificate of compliance may be necessary to determine the status of the land for the agricultural land exemption. A zoning permit is required. (See Section 2-102 for definition of AGRICULTURE [Outside the City].) (See 9-101C for Agricultural Compliance Certificate.)
O. Vision Triangle. On all corner lots in all districts, no use of land shall commence or no structure shall hereafter be constructed, structurally altered, extended, enlarged or moved after the effective date of these regulations unless it also conforms to the requirements of the vision triangle as defined by Section 2-102.

104 Screening and Landscaping. Screening and/or landscaping shall be provided when a zoning permit is issued on all properties developed for multiple-family, manufactured home park and all nonresidential uses when such uses are established on property within or adjacent to any residential districts in accordance with standards and procedures as listed below. In anticipation of a need for screening, such matters are proper subjects to be discussed and, if deemed desirable, decided at any hearing for a zoning district amendment or a special use. In addition to the requirement for screening as stated above, screening may further be required at such a hearing to preserve the value of an existing use or the potential for future development of any adjacent land or land across a right of way.
A. Screening shall be provided along all side or rear lot lines adjacent to such residential districts.
B. Landscaping shall be provided along a front lot line to the depth of at least 10 feet whenever such front lot line is adjacent to or across from such residential districts. No other uses except driveways and signs as permitted by Article 7 shall be allowed in such a landscaped area.
C. Screening shall be provided on all required development sufficient to reasonably hide from ground level view all loading docks, trash receptacles, outdoor storage, outdoor display, outdoor working areas, parking spaces and similar uses from such residential districts.
D. Screening on the side or rear lot line may be reduced in height and intensity in the front yard area extending to the front lot line, i.e., the street right of way; however, screening shall not be required along such lot lines in that portion of the front yard which may be landscaped.
E. Whenever properties are developed adjacent to an alley, screening may be omitted at driveways deemed essential for ingress and egress to uses established on the property.
F. Screening may consist of fencing and/or landscaping provided that such screening will serve to adequately reduce:
1. The visual effects on the environment caused by adjacent nonresidential or higher density residential uses;
2. Noise;
3. Lighting;
4. Glare; and
5. Blowing trash
G. All screening and landscaping shall meet the requirements of Section 3-104.
H. Landscaping along the front lot line shall involve bringing the soil surface to a smooth finished grade and installing sufficient trees, shrubs, ground cover and grass to soften building lines, provide shade and generally produce a pleasing visual effect of the premises.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 3-12
All rights reserved.
I. The selection of landscape materials shall take into consideration the "mature" growth and habit of such plants so that vegetation will not overhang or obstruct the public street or a sidewalk area in such a manner as to conflict with pedestrian and vehicular access.
J. The type of fencing should be compatible with the kind and intensity of the land use and the architectural style of the development and adjacent properties.
K. Whenever such screening is required, a screening plan for the area shall accompany the application for a zoning permit. Such plan shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission for their review and approval prior to the issuance of the zoning permit.
L. The screening plan shall be in such detail as to provide enough information to determine if the plan meets the above criteria. Such plan shall contain the location, type and height of any fence and the location, mature size and the type of any plant materials along with their common and botanical names. The sizing, grading and condition of the plant materials shall be specified according to the American Standard for Nursery Stock.
M. The Planning Commission may, in its discretion, temporarily or permanently waive the requirements for screenings and/or landscaping if:
1. The adjacent land use in the residential district may not necessitate nor benefit from such a requirement; or
2. The adjacent land use may already have provided adequate screening for which additional screening may be a duplication; or
3. The future land use for the adjacent area can not readily be determined at this time and that upon mutual agreement of the Planning Commission and the applicant, that the requirements may be waived and the matter reviewed at a specified date in the future. In the meanwhile, the Planning Commission shall require that either a letter of assurance or a covenant be submitted to run with the land; or a guarantee in the form of a corporate security bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other security be submitted to ensure that such requirements will be met when a determination is made. The Planning Commission may determine the sufficiency of the assurance based on the length of time anticipated before a decision, the size and cost of the potential work involved, and the need to ensure that the requirement is met regardless of any change in ownership.
4. Section 3-104M3 above shall not prevent the Planning Commission from requiring temporary screening on all or a portion of a side or rear yard wherein a nonresidential use is proposed for development adjacent to an existing single-family dwelling and thereby a potential nuisance or hazard may be created for the homeowner.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 3-13
All rights reserved.
N. All plant materials shall be healthy and/or fencing in place prior to issuance of an occupancy certificate. A temporary certificate may be issued as provided for in Section 9-101B2 without the landscaping installation; provided, written assurances are given satisfactory to the Zoning Administrator that the planting will take place when the proper season arrives.
O. Maintenance.
1. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain in good condition all of the required screening and landscaping improvements on his property. When it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that improvements required by Section 3-104 are not being maintained, it is his duty to give notice in writing to the property owner. Such notice shall specify in what manner the improvements are in need of maintenance and a date for compliance. The owner shall have not less than 30 days to comply with the notice; provided, however, that any person aggrieved by any such order and disagreeing with any of the requirements of the notice, may file an appeal under Section 10-106 within the 30-day period with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
2. If the owner of the land has failed, refused or neglected to make the necessary maintenance repairs within the time of the notice or time designated by the Board, then the Zoning Administrator shall cause such maintenance to be done to the property. The cost of maintenance shall be certified by the Administrator to the Clerk, who shall cause the costs to be assessed against the property on which the maintenance repairs were made.
P. To assist in reviewing screening and landscape plans, the Planning Commission may from time to time adopt design criteria in the form of policy statements which may include illustrations.
105 Site Plan Approval. The purpose and intent of requiring site plan approval is to encourage the compatible arrangement of buildings, off-street parking and loading, lighting, signage, landscaping, ingress and egress and drainage on and from the site, any or all of these, in a manner that will promote safety and convenience for the public and will preserve property values of surrounding properties. Once a site plan has been reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission, no changes shall be made except for minor revisions due to unforeseen circumstances as may be determined and approved by the Zoning Administrator. If other than minor revisions are requested, the changes must be shown on a revised plan, transmitted to and approved by the Planning Commission.
A. Applicability. All principal land uses shall submit site plans for approval by the Planning Commission except single-family dwellings and duplexes, unless the latter are arranged in courtyard or grouped settings. Such plans are applicable to all new developments, and for major alterations to an existing site or structure(s) which intensify factors affecting the overall design relationships.

107 P-O Protective Overlay District. This district may be applied as an overlay district in combination with any underlying zoning district. By limiting specific uses or requiring more restrictive development standards to individual projects or specific properties, this district is intended to:
(1) ensure compatibility among incompatible or potentially incompatible land uses;
(2) ease the transition from one zoning district to another;
(3) address sites or land uses with special requirements; and
(4) guide development of unusual situations or unique circumstances.
Development standards include, but are not limited to, lot sizes, bulk requirements, use limitations, off-street parking and loading provisions, accessory structures and uses, sign standards, miscellaneous requirements of Section 3-103 and screening and landscape requirements of Section 3-104.
A. Use and Development Standards. This district can be used to modify and restrict the use and development standards of an underlying zoning district. All requirements of this district are in addition to and supplement all other applicable standards and requirements of these regulations. Restrictions and conditions imposed by this district shall be limited to the following:
1. Prohibiting otherwise permitted or special or conditional uses and accessory uses; or making an otherwise permitted use a special or conditional use;
2. Decreasing the number or average density of dwelling units that may be constructed on the site;
3. Increasing minimum lot size or lot width;
4. Increasing minimum setback requirements in any yard;
5. Restrictions on access to abutting properties and streets, including specific design features; and
6. Any other development standards required or authorized by these regulations.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 4-20
All rights reserved.
B. Method of Adoption. Modifications and restrictions imposed through this district are considered part of this zoning text and accompanying map. All property included in the district shall be identified on the Official Zoning Maps by adding the letters "P-O" and a number to the base zoning district symbol. The number shall be assigned when the application is filed and numbers shall run consecutively beginning with number 1. The effectuating ordinance for zoning or rezoning property to the P-O district shall specifically state the modifications or restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 4-107A. Such modifications and restrictions imposed shall be considered part of the text of these regulations and a violation of them shall be a violation of these regulations. The modifications and restrictions shall continue in full force and effect until revised in accordance with the same amendment procedures as for the approval of the original P-O District.
C. Effect of P-O District Designation. When the P-O District zoning designation is applied in combination with an underlying zoning district, it shall always be considered to result in a more restrictive designation than if the district did not have the P-O classification. In the event that the P-O designation was not originally requested as part of the rezoning application, but is added instead during the public hearing process, renotification and readvertisement of the requested zoning amendment shall not be required.

108 PUD Planned Unit Development District. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District, herein referred to as a PUD District is:
(1) to encourage innovation in residential, commercial and/or industrial development by permitting greater variety and flexibility in type, design and layout of buildings; (2) to encourage a more efficient use of land reflecting changes in the technology of land development; (3) to encourage development which incorporates the best features of modern design, while conserving the value of land; and (4) to provide a procedure which relates the type, design and layout of residential, commercial and/or industrial development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of property values. The PUD District operates as an overlay zone in conjunction with all of the other districts in that it is necessary for an area to concurrently be zoned for one or more of the other districts in addition to the PUD District designation; however, such other districts may differ in one or more respects when utilized for the PUD District.
A. General Provisions.
1. The Governing Body may by ordinance approve the establishment of a PUD District on any parcel or tract of land which is suitable for and of sufficient size to be planned and developed, or redeveloped, as a unit and in a manner consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations and with the Comprehensive Plan.
2. A PUD District may be established for a residential development or for a general development. A development shall be deemed to be a residential development when it is limited to dwelling units in detached, attached or clustered, or multiple-storied structures, or any combination thereof; and nonresidential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational and business character that are primarily designed and intended to serve the residents of the residential development. A development shall be deemed to be a general development when it contains major business and/or industrial structures and uses exclusively, or when it blends residential structures or dwelling units in a unified plan with business and/or industrial structures and uses.
3. Any development that is proposing any of the following criteria shall be required to be established by approval of a PUD District:
a. To use multiple zoning classifications;
b. Land uses or standards that would not otherwise be allowed in an existing zoning district;
c. Innovation in a development, but which will preserve property values in the area;
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 4-22
All rights reserved.
d. A development of such a large size and/or intensity of land uses that, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, the design and processing of such a development would be facilitated by the establishment of a PUD District; or
e. Any combination of the above;
This does not preclude a developer from applying for a PUD District even though these regulations do not require it.
B. Standards and Criteria for Planned Unit Developments.
1. For all planned developments:
a. A development plan of the site that is not inconsistent with the standards set out in this section or with such general policies or specific rules and regulations for PUD Districts as may be adopted from time to time by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body and placed on public record in the office of the City Clerk shall prima facie be deemed to have qualified for preliminary approval. No such policies, rules or regulations shall be revised or added to which would be applicable to a specific proposal for a PUD District after an application for preliminary approval of a specific PUD plan has been filed. A PUD plan shall not be inconsistent with the following general standards for use of land, and the use, type, bulk, design and location of buildings, the density or intensity of use, the common open space, the public facilities and the development by geographic division of the site:
(1) The PUD District will not substantially injure or damage the use, value and enjoyment of surrounding property nor hinder or prevent the development of surrounding property in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
(2) The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development. Traffic control signals will be provided without expense to the City when it is determined that such signals are required to prevent traffic hazards or congestion in adjacent streets.
(3) The PUD District will not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities such as fire and police protection.
(4) The entire parcel of land to be occupied by the PUD District shall be held by a single landowner, or if there are two or more landowners, the application for such district
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 4-23
All rights reserved.
shall be filed jointly by all such landowners; however, the holder of a contract to purchase or other person having an enforceable proprietary interest in such land shall also be deemed a landowner for purposes of these regulations.
(5) The PUD plan shall contain such proposed covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the bulk, location and density of residential buildings, nonresidential uses and structures, and public facilities as are necessary for the welfare of the PUD District and are not inconsistent with the best interests of the area. Such covenants, easements and other provisions, if part of the PUD plan as finally approved, may be modified, removed or released only with the consent of the Governing Body after a public hearing before and recommendations by the Planning Commission as provided in Section 4-108C. All such covenants shall specifically provide for enforcement by the City in addition to the landowners within the development.
(6) The Planning Commission may designate divisible geographic units of the entire parcel of land to be developed as a unified plan. In the case of residential PUD plans and general PUD plans which contain residential buildings, the Planning Commission may permit in each unit deviations from the number of dwelling units per acre established for the entire plan; provided that, such deviation shall be adjusted for in other units of the plan so that the number of dwelling units per acre authorized for the entire PUD plan is not affected.
(7) For all business and industrial uses proposed for development within the plan, the standards and extent of uses shall not exceed the least restrictive requirements for the specific use as provided for in the business and industrial districts of these zoning regulations unless they meet the provisions of Sections 4-108B1a(12) and 4-108C9.
(8) The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, lighting and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a PUD plan not used for structures, parking and loading areas, or access ways, shall be landscaped or otherwise improved.
(9) When business or industrial structures or uses in a PUD District abut a residential district or residential buildings in the same development, screening shall be provided. In no event shall a business or industrial structure in a PUD District be located nearer than 100 feet to a residential building.

All rights reserved.
(10) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of these regulations, when a shopping center is developed as a PUD District, such shopping center shall have 300 square feet of space devoted to off-street parking for each 100 square feet of floor area in the structures located in the planned shopping center development. Such off-street parking facilities shall otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 5-100A of these regulations.
(11) The specifications for the width and surfacing of streets, alleys, ways for public utilities, for curbs, gutters, sidewalks, public parks and playgrounds, school grounds, reserves, storm water drainage, water supply and distribution, sanitary sewers and sewage collection and treatment adopted in the City Subdivision Regulations as amended from time to time, may, within the limits hereinafter specified, be waived or modified by the Planning Commission where the Commission finds that such specifications are not required in the interests of the residents or occupants of the planned development and that the waiver or modification of such specifications for PUD plans would not be inconsistent with the interests of the City. The Commission shall require guarantees for required public improvements and the filing of comparable engineering and survey data on final development plans.
(12) Any modifications of the zoning or other regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the site shall be warranted by the design of the PUD plan, and the amenities incorporated in it, and shall not be inconsistent with the interest of the public generally.
2. Standards for Residential Planned Developments and General Planned Developments Containing Residential Buildings:
a. Any PUD plan that does not propose to increase the number of dwelling units per acre that would otherwise be permitted on the property under the maximum zoning regulations otherwise applicable thereto in the districts which permit residences shall be prima facie qualified for preliminary approval insofar as residential density is concerned. A PUD plan may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per acre than would be permitted by these district regulations otherwise applicable to the site, but if the number of dwelling units per acre exceeds by more than 10% of that permitted by the zoning regulations otherwise applicable to the site, the developer has the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property. The Planning Commission, in determining the
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 4-25
All rights reserved.
reasonableness of a proposed increase in the number of dwelling units per acre, shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public services to be achieved by: (1) the amount, location and proposed use of common open spaces; and (2) the location, design and type of dwelling units. The Planning Commission shall also consider that the physical characteristics of the site may make increased densities appropriate in the particular location. In addition to establishing a maximum density, the plan shall specify either the minimum number of dwelling units and commercial or industrial uses or the minimum acreage allowances for each specific PUD District.
b. When common open space is provided in a PUD plan, the amount and location of such common open space shall be consistent with the declared type of development as described in Section 4-108A2 for a PUD District. The PUD plan shall include such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of the common open space as are reasonably necessary to ensure its continuity, care, conservation and maintenance, and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the City if the common open space is permitted to deteriorate or is not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interest of the PUD plan or of the City. If the City finds it necessary to carry out the obligations required to maintain the open space in order to avoid having it become a public nuisance, the costs shall be assessed against the properties within the development and shall become a tax lien on said properties.
c. When a PUD plan includes common open space, such common open space shall never be used for the construction of any structure, nor shall such open space ever be computed as a part of the required minimum lot area, or any required yard, of any other structure. Adequate safeguards, including recorded covenants, shall be provided to prevent subsequent development of, and the future construction of structures on, such open space.
d. The total ground area occupied by buildings and structures shall not exceed 35% of the total ground area of the PUD plan unless previous development in the neighborhood has a greater lot coverage, in which case the PUD plan may increase the lot coverage of buildings and structures to correspond with the bulk of the other structures in the neighborhood.
e. Nonresidential uses of a religious, educational or recreational nature shall be designed or intended primarily for the use of the residents of the PUD plan.

All rights reserved.
C. Preliminary PUD Plan Contents. An application to establish a PUD District shall be processed in the same manner prescribed for amending these Zoning Regulations. The same requirements for notice to property owners, advertisement of public hearing, protest petitions, and adoption by the Governing Body shall be required as in conventional zoning. (See Article 11.) The applicant shall also concurrently prepare and submit a preliminary PUD plan for review and recommendation by the Planning Commission which shall contain the following information and documents:
1. A development plan of the site showing the location, arrangement, bulk, type and use of all existing and proposed structures, the proposed traffic circulation pattern within and surrounding the development, the areas to be developed for parking, the points of ingress and egress, access streets where required, the relationship of abutting land uses and zoning districts, proposed lots and blocks, if any, and proposed public or common open space, if any, including reserves, parks, playgrounds, school sites and recreational facilities.
2. Applicable information as required for a preliminary plat pursuant to provisions in the City Subdivision Regulations.
3. A statement of the anticipated residential density (when applicable), the proposed total gross floor area of nonresidential uses, and the percentage of the development which is to be occupied by structures, i.e., total area of all such zoning lots.
4. Preliminary sketches and/or description of the proposed screening and landscaping features.
5. When a PUD plan is to be constructed in units the phasing of development for each unit in sequence shall be indicated. No such unit shall have a residential density that exceeds by more than 20% the proposed residential density of the entire PUD plan. When a PUD plan provides for common open space, the total area of common open space provided at any stage of development shall, at minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire plan as the units completed or under development bear to the entire plan.
6. Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the parcel of land to effectuate the proposed plan, including a statement of all the ownership and beneficial interests in the land and the proposed development.
7. When it deems necessary, the Planning Commission may require a traffic survey setting out and analyzing the effect that the PUD plan will have upon traffic in the streets and thoroughfare adjacent to and in the vicinity of the proposed development.

All rights reserved.
8. A statement of objectives showing the relationship of the PUD plan to the Comprehensive Plan with respect to land use for various purposes, density of population, direction of growth, location and function of streets and other public facilities, and common open space for recreation or visual benefit or both, and such other factors as the City may find relevant in making a finding whether a PUD plan shall be authorized as being in general conformity to the Comprehensive Plan.
9. In the case of general planned developments, a statement identifying the principal types of business and/or industrial uses that are to be included in the proposed development.
10. When a PUD plan includes provisions for common open space, or recreational facilities, a statement describing the provision that is to be made for the care and maintenance of such open space or recreational facilities. If it is proposed that such open space be owned and/or maintained by any entity other than a governmental authority, copies of the proposed articles of incorporation and bylaws of such entity shall be submitted.
11. Copies of any restrictive covenants that are to be recorded with respect to property included in the PUD plan.
D. Action on Preliminary PUD Plan.
1. Hearing, Findings and Recommendation of Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall, within 60 days after a preliminary PUD plan is filed with it, hold a public hearing on the plan after giving the notice required by Section 11-100D for hearings on amendments. Such public hearing shall consider all aspects of the preliminary PUD plan including all proposed units of development. Within 14 days after the last public hearing on such plan, the Commission shall prepare and transmit to the Governing Body and to the applicant specific findings of fact with respect to the extent to which the preliminary PUD plan complies with the standards set out in Sections 4-108B and C, together with its recommendations to the Governing Body with respect to the action to be taken on the PUD plan. The Commission may recommend approval, disapproval or approval with modifications, conditions or restrictions. Copies of the findings and recommendations of the Planning Commission shall be made available to any other interested persons.
2. Action by the Governing Body. After a 14-day period following the public hearing in which to receive protest petitions as provided by Section 11-103, the Governing Body shall under the adoption procedures of Section 11-104 consider the approval or disapproval of the preliminary PUD plan after it receives the findings and recommendations of the Planning Commission thereon. If the preliminary PUD is disapproved, the applicant shall be furnished with a written statement of the reasons for disapproval of the plan.

receiving from the applicant any acceptance required by Section 4-108D3, adopt an ordinance approving the preliminary PUD plan, and establishing a PUD District for the parcel of land included in the preliminary PUD plan.
3. Restrictions and Conditions. The Governing Body may alter the preliminary PUD plan according to the procedures of Section 11-104 (2) or (3) and impose such conditions and restrictions on the PUD plan as it may deem necessary to ensure that the development will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these regulations and with the Comprehensive Plan. When the Governing Body alters the preliminary PUD plan, the applicant shall have 30 days within which to file an acceptance of such alterations, conditions or restrictions.
4. Form of Ordinance. An ordinance establishing a PUD District and approving a PUD plan shall specify the Zoning Regulations and restrictions that will, pursuant to the PUD plan, apply in the PUD District and shall describe the boundaries of such district or set such boundaries out on a map that is incorporated and published as a part of such ordinance. Such ordinance shall also specify the conditions and restrictions that have been imposed by the Governing Body on the PUD plan, and the extent to which the otherwise applicable district regulations have been modified.
E. Status of Preliminary PUD Plan After Approval.

Within 15 days after the adoption of an ordinance establishing a PUD District and approving a preliminary PUD plan, a copy of such ordinance shall be filed by the City Clerk with the Zoning Administrator and a similar copy mailed to the applicant. When approval of such a preliminary plan has been granted, the establishment of the PUD District by name shall be noted on the Official Zoning Maps.
2. After being notified of the approval of a preliminary PUD plan by the Governing Body, the applicant shall within 15 days file with the County Register of Deeds a statement that such a plan has been filed with the City and has been approved and is applicable to certain specified legally described land and that copies of said plan are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator. Such statement recorded with the Register of Deeds shall also specify the nature of the plan, the proposed density or intensity of land uses and other pertinent information sufficient to notify any prospective purchasers or users of land of the existence of such a plan. The recorded statement shall specify that the preliminary PUD plan shall become binding upon all successors and assigns unless amended in conformance with these regulations.

3. Preliminary approval of a PUD plan shall not qualify such a plan for recording. A PUD plan which has been given preliminary approval as submitted or which has been given preliminary approval with alterations, conditions and restrictions, which have been accepted by the applicant (and provided that the applicant has not defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the preliminary approval), shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the City pending an application or applications for approval of a final PUD plan without the consent of the applicant; provided that, an application for a final PUD plan approval is filed within one year of the date of approval of the preliminary PUD plan, or in the case of unit developments, that a final plan of at least one unit shall be filed within one year from the date of approval of such preliminary plan and final plans of all such units shall be filed within five years from the date that such preliminary plan was approved. The Planning Commission on application of the applicant, may from time to time, recommend extensions of time to the Governing Body for their decision within which an applicant may submit such final PUD plans. Each such extension shall not be for more than one year.
4. In the event that a PUD plan is given preliminary approval and thereafter, but prior to approval of a final PUD plan, the applicant shall: (1) choose to abandon said plan and shall so notify the Planning Commission in writing; or (2) shall fail to timely file an application, or applications, for approval of a final plan, it shall be deemed to be revoked. When a preliminary plan is revoked, all that portion of the preliminary plan for which final approval has not been given shall be subject to those provisions of the Zoning Regulations and other local ordinances that were applicable thereto immediately prior to the approval of the preliminary plan and as they may have been amended from time to time. The Governing Body shall forthwith adopt an ordinance repealing the PUD District and the preliminary PUD plan for that portion of the development that has not received final PUD plan approval and reestablishing the zoning and other regulatory provisions that would otherwise be applicable. When a PUD District is revoked, such revocation shall be noted on the Official Zoning Maps.
F. Final PUD Plan Contents and Approval.
1. An application for approval of a final PUD plan may be filed for all the land included in a planned development or for a unit thereof. Such application shall be filed by the applicant with the Zoning Administrator within the specified time in Section 4-108E3, and shall be in substantial compliance with the preliminary PUD plan as approved. The application shall include:
a. A development plan of the site showing the physical layout and design of all streets, easements, rights of way, reserves, lots, blocks and common open space including statements, where applicable, on the residential densities, the types and uses of structures, the maximum

All rights reserved.
gross floor area, the percentage of the development by total area of such zoning lots to be occupied by structures, the height of structures, the height and size of signs, the building setback lines, and the boundary of units within which the phasing of construction would be scheduled.
b. Applicable information and certificates as required for a final plat pursuant to the provisions in the City Subdivision Regulations including such waivers and modifications as may have been agreed to in the preliminary PUD plan.
c. Plans for landscaping and screening.
d. A statement of dedication for easements or right of ways and a copy of any restrictive covenants.
e. Proof of the establishment and activation of any entity that is to be responsible for the management and maintenance of any common open space.
f. No lots, parcel or dwelling unit in such development shall be conveyed or leased prior to the recording of the final PUD plan.
g. Such guarantees and agreements that are required by the provisions and procedures of the City Subdivision Regulations regarding final plats.
2. A PUD plan submitted for final approval shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the preliminary PUD plan, as approved; provided that, any modification by the developer of the preliminary plan, as approved, does not: (1) vary the proposed gross residential density or intensity of use by more than 5%; or (2) involve a reduction of the area set aside for common open space; or (3) increase by more than 10% the gross floor area proposed for nonresidential use; or (4) increase by more than 5% the total area of zoning lots used for buildings or a substantial change in their height. A public hearing shall not be held to consider modifications in the location and design of streets or facilities for water and for disposal of sanitary sewerage and storm water.
3. Although a public hearing shall not be required on an application for approval of a final PUD plan to determine if it is in substantial compliance with the preliminary PUD plan, as approved, the Planning Commission may receive public input related to the final plan if deemed desirable. The burden shall be upon the applicant to show the Planning Commission good cause for any variation between the preliminary plan, as approved, and the final plan as submitted. When the application for final approval has been filed, together with all drawings, specifications and other documents required in support thereof, the Commission shall make a recommendation on such final plan; provided, however, that in the event the final plan as submitted contains variations from the
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 4-31
All rights reserved.
preliminary plan as approved, but remains in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan, as approved, the Commission may, after a meeting with the applicant, refuse to recommend approval of the final plan and shall so advise the applicant in writing of such refusal, setting out the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public interest. In the event of such refusal, the applicant may refile his application for final approval without the variations objected to by the Commission at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval. If the time for applying for final approval shall have expired at the time when the Commission advised the applicant that the variations were not in the public interest, then the applicant shall have 60 additional days within which to refile an application for final approval without the said variation. If the applicant shall fail to refile within said period, he or she shall be deemed to have refused to accept such requirements and final approval shall be deemed to have not been approved.
4. In the event the final PUD plan, as submitted for approval, is not in substantial compliance with the preliminary PUD plan as approved, the Planning Commission shall so notify the applicant in writing, setting out the particular ways in which the final plan is not in substantial compliance with the preliminary plan as approved. The applicant may make such changes in the final plan as are necessary to bring it into compliance with the preliminary plan as provided for variations in Section 4-108F3, or may file an application for an amended PUD District and/or a preliminary PUD plan in order to bring the proposed final plan into substantial compliance with such an amended District or plan. The time limit within which to file such amendments shall be the same as for a variation in Section 4-108F3. Such public hearing shall be held, notice thereof shall be given, and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in Sections 4-108D and E of these regulations including the provisions for protest petitions, Governing Body approval and filing a revised statement of the plan with the County Register of Deeds. In the event the applicant shall fail to take either of these alternate actions within said time, the applicant shall be deemed to have abandoned the plan.
5. After a final PUD plan, or any unit thereof, has been submitted for consideration by either the procedures prescribed in Sections 4-108F3 or 4, the plan shall be considered for final approval by the Governing Body within 30 days. A final PUD plan, or any part thereof, which has been given final approval by the Governing Body, shall be filed of record with the County Register of Deeds within 60 days following the satisfying of all conditions precedent and conditioned upon such approval as well as signatures for all certificates required for a final plat before recording. A copy of the recorded final plan shall also be filed with the Zoning Administrator before any building and/or zoning permits are issued or development takes place in accordance therewith. In the event the Governing Body fails to act, either by approval or by disapproval within the time prescribed, the final plan shall be deemed to be approved.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 4-32
All rights reserved.
Pending completion within a reasonable time of said PUD, or of any unit thereof, that has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said plan, or unit thereof, as finally approved, shall be made except with the consent of the applicant.
6. In the event that a final PUD plan or unit thereof is given final approval and thereafter the applicant shall abandon said plan or the unit thereof and shall so notify the City in writing, or in the event the applicant shall fail to commence the plan within 18 months after final approval, it shall terminate and shall be deemed null and void unless such time period is extended by the Governing Body upon written application by the applicant.
G. Enforcement and Modification. To further the mutual interest of the residents and owners of the final PUD plan and of the public in the preservation of the integrity of the plan, as finally approved and to ensure that modifications, if any, in the plan shall not impair the reasonable reliance of the residents and owners upon the provisions of the plan, nor result in changes that would adversely affect the public interest, the enforcement and modification of the provisions of the plan as finally approved, whether recorded by plan, covenant, easement or otherwise, shall be subject to the following provisions:
1. Enforcement by the City. The provisions of the final plan relating to:
a. The use of land and the use, bulk (height, yards and maximum coverage) and location of buildings and structures;
b. The quality and location of common open space; and
c. The intensity of use or the density of residential units shall run in favor of the City and shall be enforceable in law or in equity by the City without limitation on any powers or regulation otherwise granted the City by law.
2. Enforcement by the residents and owners. All provisions of the final plan shall run in favor of the residents and owners of the planned development, but only to the extent expressly provided in the plan and in accordance with the terms of the plan and to that extent such provisions, whether recorded by plan, covenant, easement or otherwise, may be enforced at law or equity by residents and owners, acting individually, jointly, or through an organization designated in the plan to act on their behalf; provided, however, that no provisions of the plan shall be implied to exist in favor of residents and owners of the development except as to those portions of the plan which have been finally approved and have been recorded.
3. Modification of the final plan by the City. All those provisions of the plan authorized to be enforced by the City under Section 4-108G1 may be modified, removed or released by the City (except grants or easements relating to the service or equipment of a public utility unless

All rights reserved.
expressly consented to by the public utility), subject to the following conditions:
a. No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of the plan by the City shall affect the rights of the residents and owners of the planned development to maintain and enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as provided in Section 4-108G2.
b. No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the plan by the City shall be permitted except upon a finding by the City, following notice of a public hearing called and held in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, that (1) the same is consistent with the efficient development and preservation of the entire final PUD plan; (2) does not adversely affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across a street from the plan or the public interest; and (3) is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon any person.
4. Modification by the residents and owners. Residents and owners of the planned development may, to the extent and in the manner expressly authorized by the provision of the plan, modify, remove or release their rights to enforce the provisions of the plan, but no such action shall affect the right of the City to enforce the provisions of the plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 4-108G1. If it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that such modifications would result in changes to the PUD District and/or the preliminary PUD plan, then application must be made for such amendment or amendments to be considered for re-approval of the district or plan in the same manner as the original. If it is determined that modifications resulting in changes to the final PUD plan are necessary and cannot be satisfied under Sections 4-108F2, 3, 4 and 5, then application must be made for such amendment or amendments to the original PUD District or preliminary PUD plan as may be necessary to consider such amendment(s).

109 C-O College Overlay District. This district may be applied as an overlay district in combination with the underlying residential districts, i.e. the R-1 Single-Family and the R-2 Multiple-Family Residential district. More specifically, the C-O District is intended to accommodate the development of a college as an institution of higher education. This may be accomplished by serving both as a permitted use for the main campus owned or leased by the college as well as being applied on adjacent residentially zoned properties as individual special uses. By delineating the boundary of the district on the latter residential area, such area is recognized as a logical and desirable direction for the expansion of the college itself and its many potential related activities.
A. Permitted and Conditional Uses. When the C-O District is applied as an overlay district, the following uses shall be permitted by-right in addition to all the permitted and conditional uses in any underlaying residential district:
Colleges including their buildings owned or leased as principal and accessory structures for administrative and faculty offices; classrooms; laboratories; chapels; auditoriums; lecture halls; libraries; student, faculty, and alumni centers; athletic facilities; maintenance buildings and dormitories, group residences, and day care facilities for student and faculty housing. Permitted outside activities shall include marching, drilling, band, athletics, campus celebrations and displays, graduations, scientific research, music and drama presentations, off-street parking, and similar functions.
B. Special Uses. When the C-O District is applied as an overlay district, the special uses allowed within the underlying residential district shall be special uses within the C-O overlay as well. In addition, the following uses related to the college activities shall also be designated as special uses in the C-O College Overlay District:
1. Offices, meeting rooms, laboratories, and other facilities for educational, fraternal, professional, religious, service, and research organizations and institutions having a demonstrated relationship to the college.
2. Libraries, art galleries, museums, and other nonprofit cultural groups.
Such special uses shall be expected to be accompanied by the parking space requirements of Article 5, the accessory uses allowed by Article 6, and the Signs of Article 7.
C. Property Development Standards. Each zoning lot developed under the C-O District provisions shall adhere to the Bulk Regulations, Lot Size Requirements, and Use Limitations of the underlying residential district, unless modified by processing the proposed new development as a special use case. Such cases shall be processed in the same manner as a zoning amendment in Article II, except not delineated on the Official Zoning Map.

ARTICLE 5. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
100 Off-Street Parking. In any applicable zoning district, all structures built and all uses established hereafter shall provide accessory off-street parking in accordance with the following regulations. When an existing structure or use is expanded, accessory off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with the following regulations for the area or capacity of such expansion. Plans showing the layout and design of all off-street parking spaces and loading areas must be submitted and approved by the Zoning Administrator before a zoning permit and/or occupancy certificate is issued for such spaces or areas.
A. General Provisions.
1. Utilization: Accessory off-street parking facilities provided for the uses hereinafter listed shall be solely for the parking of motor vehicles in operating condition of patrons, occupants or employees of such uses. Such parking facilities or any vacant lot shall not be used to display or store motor vehicles including recreational vehicles and utility trailers for sale other than where permitted specifically in a district. Such provision shall not prevent the display of a small temporary for sale sign not exceeding two square feet in size on a personal vehicle when parked periodically on a driveway or an identifiable parking area on a zoning lot of a residence or a business location. (See Section 2-102 for definition of STORAGE, OUTDOOR.)
2. Parking space dimension: An off-street parking space shall be at least eight feet six inches in width and at least 18 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps or columns, unless special parking is designated for variable sizes of vehicles.
3. Access: Each off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. No parking space shall be designed to exit or back directly onto a public street or use the public right of way for parking space, unless less specifically approved by the Governing Body. Such arrangements are to be discouraged, except in unusual circumstances wherein the traffic safety of the public can still be protected.

All rights reserved.
4. Open and enclosed parking: Off-street parking spaces open to the sky may be located in any yard, except that in residential districts no such spaces shall be located in a front yard setback other than for multiple-family dwellings. Principal buildings with garages and carports integrated into or attached to the buildings which contain or shelter off-street parking spaces shall be subject to the yard setback requirements applicable in the district wherein the buildings are located. Detached garages and carports which contain or shelter off-street parking spaces shall be subject to the provisions of the accessory uses contained in Section 6-100 and, in particular, the bulk regulations of Section 6-100C. (See Section 3-103F1 for canopies.)
5. Design and Maintenance:
a. Design: Off-street parking spaces shall comply with such design standards relating to curb cuts and curb length, stall depth, driveway width, island width, barriers, and the location of ingress and egress as may be established from time to time by the City. Off-street parking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed in a building or structure. Parking on driveways for single and two-family dwellings and all types of manufactured and mobile homes is considered to be permitted temporary parking and required parking spaces on such lots are not to be in the front yard setback. All parking spaces must be in an identifiable area where all spaces are contained thereon. (See Section 5-100A5c for screening.)
b. Surfacing: All open off-street parking spaces, whether required spaces or not, and driveways shall be graded and paved with an asphalt, asphaltic concrete or concrete which shall be maintained in good condition; provided, however, graveled parking areas are permitted in the agricultural and industrial districts, for church parking lots and in manufactured home parks.
c. Screening: Screening for parking spaces and loading areas is incorporated into the general screening and landscaping provisions of Section 3-104.
d. Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking spaces shall be shaded so that direct light is not cast upon property located in a residential district and so that glare is not a problem to traffic on any public street.
e. Repair and service: No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in association with any off-street parking spaces or structures, except as incidental repairs to a personal vehicle. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SALVAGE YARD.)

All rights reserved.
f. Computation: When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by these regulations results in a requirement of a fractional space, the fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, and a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
g. Collective provisions: Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so furnished is not less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use; provided, that wherever there is a common plan of parking for land in single ownership that the amount of required parking shall consider the joint use of such space whenever large places of assembly are present which vary in their times of use and season of the year to the end that all parking is contained on the site or on accessory parking lots except for infrequent periods of peak use. The off-street parking spaces required by Section 5-101 may be increased; however, where it is anticipated that peak parking periods will be a consistently reoccurring problem. All regulations must be adhered to which cover the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served.
h. Location: All parking spaces required to serve structures or uses shall be located on the same zoning lot as the structure or use served unless a conditional use permit is obtained under Section 5-102.
i. Employee parking: Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
j. Handicapped parking: Parking spaces according to the number of spaces and their designated signage shall be provided for persons with a disability in conformance to the standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as incorporated into state statutes. (See K.S.A. 58-1311 and 42 USCA 12101 et seq.)
6. Plans and approval required: Plans showing the layout and design of all off-street parking spaces whether required spaces or not, including driveways and loading areas, shall be submitted and approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to issuance of a zoning permit and/or occupancy certificate for the parking lot itself or as part of an application for a larger related project. Before approving any parking layout, the Administrator shall determine that the spaces provided are usable and meet standard design criteria as well as all parking requirements of these regulations. Parking spaces shall be clearly indicated or otherwise marked to designate the individual spaces.

ARTICLE 6. ACCESSORY USES, TEMPORARY USES AND HOME OCCUPATIONS
100 Accessory Uses Authorization. Accessory uses are permitted in any zoning district in connection with any principal use which is permitted.
A. Definitions. An accessory use is a structure or use which:
1. Is subordinate to and serves a principal building or use;
2. Is subordinate in area, extent or purpose to the principal building or use served; however, this does not preclude recreational areas for tennis, swimming, racquetball, basketball and similar activities;
3. Contributes to the comfort, recreation, convenience or necessity of occupants, business or industry in the principal building or use served; and
4. Is located on the same zoning lot as the principal structure or use served. (See Section 6-100D1 regarding beginning any accessory structure or use prior to the principal structure or use.)

1. Off-street parking and loading space as regulated by Article 5 of these regulations, including detached garages and carports. On lots which are not over 10,000 square feet in size for single and two-family dwelling units and all types of manufactured and mobile homes such structures may contain incidental space for storage and other uses and are limited to one each per zoning lot not over 960 square feet in gross floor area for a garage and 500 for a carport, unless a conditional use is approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals for a larger structure. Similarly, on lots over 10,000 square feet, detached garages and carports shall not be limited in size.
2. Signs, when permitted by Article 7 of these regulations.

3. Buildings for storage and other purposes; provided, that no such building on lots which are not over 10,000 square feet in size which is accessory to single and two-family dwelling units and all types of manufactured or mobile homes shall not exceed 400 square feet in gross floor area, unless a conditional use is approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals for a larger building. Similarly on lots over 10,000 square feet in size, such detached buildings are not limited in size.
No motorized vehicle of any type or any portion thereof such as a truck trailer may be used on a residential lot for storage or any purpose other than for periodic construction or vehicular parking according to Provisions of Article 5. Similarly, a railroad box car, construction trailer, dumpster, shipping container or portable storage unit are not permitted permanently on a residential lot. Motorized vehicles and portions thereof, construction trailers, dumpsters, shipping containers or portable storage units; however, may be used temporarily for refuse disposal or storage during a period of construction, reconstruction or moving including location on a driveway.

E. Home Occupation Authorization by Conditional Use. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Section 6-102A through D, an application may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use to allow a home occupation in an agricultural district which would permit a broader range of home occupations and less restrictions than otherwise required, so long as in the opinion of the Board under stated conditions that the effect upon adjacent areas is minimized to the extent feasible and the public interest is served. The intent of such a provision is to provide for a wider range of home occupational activities while at the same time protecting adjacent properties from the intrusion of incompatible uses and uses of too great an intensity. In addition to the procedures and standards for establishing conditional uses as provided for in Section 10-108, the Board may, using the use limitation restrictions of Section 6-102B as guidelines, permit the following variations:
1. Limited outdoor storage of goods, materials and equipment when screened wherever feasible.
2. Limited outdoor display of goods, when deemed essential to the proper merchandising of the product.
3. Limited number of additional employees other than members of the immediate family occupying the dwelling unit may be employed regularly or periodically.

6. Limitations as to stated periods of operational time such as hours, days and seasons.
7. Conditions may be attached to the premises and/or to the person(s) conducting the home occupation, including licenses and permits.

Electronic signs shall be classified as animated. No electronic message sign shall be erected or installed without dimming controls to ensure the sign is appropriately dimmed at night. Acceptable dimming controls include automated light sensing devices (photocells) and/or programmable controls that are set by the user to automatically dim the sign at night. Generally the maximum night time brightness and/or intensity shall not exceed 3,000 nits (or equivalent). For electronic message signs that have a maximum brightness and/or intensity of 3,000 nits or less, dimming controls shall not be required.
2. No flashing signs, rotating or moving signs, animated signs, signs with moving lights or signs which create the illusion of movement shall be permitted in any residential district, except for nonresidential structures and uses. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SIGN.)

All rights reserved.
K. Location. No private sign or structure thereof shall be permitted on a public right of way or public easement, except temporary real estate and garage sale signs may be placed on the public right of way with the approval of the adjacent landowner to provide direction to the property during a showing or sale provided such signs do not obstruct traffic visibility. No sign shall be permitted to project over a public right of way or public easement, except with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals as a conditional use, or as a permitted use in the B-2 Central Business District when the lowest part of such sign is at least eight feet above the walking surface. (See Section 7-102L2 for portable signs, Section 7-103A5 for garage sale signs and Section 7-103B5 for real estate signs.)
L. Portable Signs. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Article 7, the following provisions apply to the use of portable signs:
1. A portable sign is defined as a temporary on-site sign designed in such a manner as to be readily movable and not permanently attached to the premises, such as A-frames, trailer signs, signs placed on vehicles, beacon lights and other similar signs. Any such sign shall not exceed a height of 10 feet above grade level nor 60 square feet in gross surface area, unless otherwise indicated.
2. All the general standards of Sections 7-102A through K are applicable to portable signs, except that in Section 7-102K such signs may project over or be located on public easements, but not the public street right of way. No such signs shall be placed on the roof of structures.
3. Whereas portable signs are not required to set back any minimum distance from lot lines in any zoning district, the Zoning Administrator shall, in his or her discretion, strictly enforce the traffic safety provisions of Section 7-102J1, especially at corner intersections and driveway entrances and exits.
4. In all zoning districts, except agricultural and residential districts, portable signs are permitted; however, any such sign shall not be located closer than 50 feet to another such sign when measured along the frontage whether the latter is located on the same or another zoning lot, except that each business firm shall be permitted at least one such sign notwithstanding the 50-foot minimum spacing standard.
5. In all agricultural and residential districts only, portable signs are permitted which limit their messages to the following subjects, and no such sign shall exceed 60 square feet in the A-1 Agricultural Transition District or 32 square feet in all residential zoned districts.
a. Announcements of special occasions or activities of nonprofit organizations such as churches and fraternal and service clubs.

All rights reserved.
b. Announcements related to personal or family events such as "Happy Birthday" and the like.
The above signs are limited to a display period of not more than 15 days for any one announcement, with the gross surface area not to exceed 32 square feet and only one sign at a time permitted on the premises of the party making the announcement.
6. In addition to the provisions of Sections 7-102D and E, strobe light sources or flashing bulbs or signs which create the illusion of movement shall not be permitted on portable signs in any district. Electrified portable signs shall not be connected to any electrical power source except during the hours when the business, office or institution is open. Electrical lines shall not be permitted to lay on the ground where vehicular traffic or pedestrian passage is allowed and the use of extension cords for portable signs is prohibited. Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (G.F.C.I.) are required on all electrified signs.
7. A zoning permit for each portable sign shall be obtained for each 30 day period or part thereof when the sign remains on the zoning lot. Annual permits may be obtained for the use of such signs at one or more locations during the year. All portable signs shall bear an identification marker to indicate the owner's name and some system of identifying the individual sign, e.g., by number.
8. Any unauthorized portable sign placed on public property, including the public street or road right of way, is declared to be a public nuisance and be the cause of its removal and impoundment without notice. If not redeemed within 30 days by the owner paying a service charge, the City may dispose of the sign in any manner deemed appropriate. The Zoning Administrator may revoke the permit for any sign deemed to be in violation of this Section, i.e., 7-102L, or of any condition on which the permit was based and order its removal within a reasonable period consistent with public safety.
M. Damaged or Unsafe Signs. The Zoning Administrator shall require the immediate repair or removal of any conforming or nonconforming sign or sign structure which has been damaged or deteriorated so as to become a public hazard. Such a sign or sign structure may be restored to its original condition without obtaining a zoning permit, unless the sign is replaced and, thus, must conform to current regulations.

ARTICLE 8. NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
100 Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to (1) provide for the regulation of nonconforming lots, buildings, structures and uses; and (2) specify those circumstances and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue. The right to continue a nonconforming lot, building, structure or use shall not be affected by a change in ownership or operator of the structure or use unless such ownership or operator is a condition attached to an approval for a special or conditional use. Definitions of such nonconformities are as follow:
A. Nonconforming Lot of Record: A zoning lot which is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations and such lot now neither complies with the lot area requirements or the width for any permitted uses in the zoning district in which it is located.
B. Nonconforming Structure: An existing building or structure which does not comply with the maximum lot coverage and height or the minimum yard requirements which are applicable to new structures in the zoning district in which it is located.
C. Nonconforming Use: An existing use of a structure or land which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Nonconformity. A nonconforming lot, use or structure that does not comply with currently applicable regulations, but that complied with zoning regulations in effect at the time it was legally established. (See Sections 8-100A, B and C and 8-107 on Registration of Nonconformities and Exemptions.)
101 Nonconforming Lots of Record.
A. In Any Residential District.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of these regulations, a single-family detached dwelling or any type of manufactured or mobile home which is a permitted use and complies with the restrictions in Section 8-101A2 may be located on a lot(s) in the same ownership that is not less than 50 feet in width with public water and sewerage or meets the provisions of the County Sanitary Code outside the City and that consists entirely of a tract of land that:
a. Has less than the prescribed minimum lot area, width or depth, or all three; and
b. Meets the definition in Section 8-100A for a nonconforming lot of record.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 8-2
All rights reserved.
2. Construction permitted by Section 8-101A1 shall comply with all of the regulations except lot area, width and depth applicable to a single-family detached dwelling or any type of manufactured or mobile home permitted in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located; provided, however, that the following side yard requirements shall apply in place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable:
a. The structure shall be placed on the lot so as to provide a yard on each side of the dwelling.
b. The sum of the widths of the two side yards on each lot shall be not less than the smaller of:
(1) 20% of the width of the lot, or
(2) the minimum total for both side yards prescribed by the bulk regulations for the zoning district.
c. In any case, neither side yard resulting from the methods permitted in Section 8-101A2b shall be less than five feet wide.
d. When a yard is also considered to be a front yard on a corner lot, one of the front yards comprising part of the lot width may be reduced to 15 feet; provided, that a driveway to a parking space must maintain a length of at least 20 feet from the front lot line.
B. In Districts Other than Residential Districts.
1. Notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other provision of these regulations, a structure designed for any permitted use may be erected on a lot of the type described in Section 8-101A1.
2. Construction permitted by Section 8-101B1 shall comply with all of the regulations except lot area, width and depth applicable in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located; provided, however, that the width of any side yard must not be less than that derived by applying the following formula (wherein the width of any side yard required = w):
Minimum side yard required
Actual lot width X by district regulations
W=
Minimum lot width required by district regulations

102 Nonconforming Structures.
A. Authority to Continue. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements and/or the applicable bulk regulations, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in Section 8-102B through 8-102D.
B. Enlargement, Repair or Alterations. Any such structure described in Section 8-102A may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or structurally altered; provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure, except that as to structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side yard requirements shall be determined by Section 8-101A2 or 8-101B2, whichever is applicable.
C. Damage. In the event that any structure described in Section 8-102A is damaged, by any means except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located; provided, that structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements shall not in any event be required to provide a side yard that exceeds the yard requirements in Sections 8-101A2 or B2, whichever is applicable. When a structure is damaged to the extent of 50% or less of its fair market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. If the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in approving the percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination. (See Section 8-105 for Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses and Appendix for substantial improvement in the Floodplain Management Regulations.)
D. Moving. No structure described in Section 8-102A shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved. (See Section 3-103M for Moving Structures.)

103 Nonconforming Uses.
A. Authority to Continue. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of part or all of a structure or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure or only involving a structure which is accessory to such use of land, may be continued, so long as otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Sections 8-103B through 8-103J.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance.
1. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of Sections 8-103C through I of these regulations.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition provided that such restoration will not be in violation of Section 8-103F of these regulations.
C. Structural Alteration. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be structural altered unless the entire structure and use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
D. Extension.
1. Extension of a nonconforming use is permitted within a nonconforming structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent amendment heretofore that caused such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that no structural alterations shall be made unless such changes, and the use thereof, conform to the regulations of the district in which the structure is located.
2. Extension of a nonconforming use of a part of a structure is not permitted if all or substantially all of the structure is designed or intended for a use which is permitted in the district in which the structure is located, nor shall the use be changed to any other nonconforming use.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 8-5
All rights reserved.
3. Extension of a nonconforming use is not permitted to any structure or land area other than the one actually occupied or used by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of the original City Zoning Regulations or a subsequent amendment heretofore that caused such use to become nonconforming.
E. Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
F. Damage. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged, by any means except flooding, to the extent of more than 50% of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When such damage is 50% or less of the fair market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning permit is obtained, and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage and is diligently pursued to completion. If the applicant is aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Administrator in approving the percent of damage to the value of the structure based on data submitted by the applicant, an appeal may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a determination. (See Section 8-105 for Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses and Appendix for substantial improvement in the Floodplain Management Regulations.)
G. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. (See Section 3-103M for Moving Structures.)
H. Change in Use. If no structural alterations are made other than those necessary to repair or maintain the structure as described in Section 8-103B1, a nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a similar type of use or more restrictive use. Similarly, a nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving only an accessory structure may also be changed. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restrictive use or to any permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to a less restrictive use or to a nonconforming use. In determining whether a change in use is the same, similar or more restrictive, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the changes in environmental factors such as outdoor storage, loading, traffic, parking, noise, lighting, air pollution, hours of operation, screening and other factors, as well as the provisions available in Section 8-105. (See Section 9-101A for Zoning Permits and Section 9-101B for Occupancy Certificates.)

All rights reserved.
I. Abandonment.
1. When a nonconforming use of land, not involving a structure, or involving only a structure which is accessory to the nonconforming use of land, is abandoned for a period of six consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located.
2. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located is abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such structure is located.
3. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a structure which was not designed and intended for any use which is permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located, is abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such struc-ture is located.
J. Nonconforming Accessory Uses. No use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or terminate.
104 Nonconforming Residential Structures. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8-103C, D and E, any structure which is devoted to a residential use and which is located in a business or industrial district, may be structurally altered, extended, expanded and enlarged; provided, that after any such alteration, extension, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work, unless specifically permitted by the district.
105 Nonconforming Nonresidential Structures and Uses. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations and, in particular, Sections 8-102B and C and 8-103C, D, E, and F, nonconforming nonresidential structures and uses that existed on the day prior to the effective date of these regulations, may apply on a one time basis only to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a conditional use to structurally alter, enlarge or reconstruct after damage, or make extensions to structures or uses including the use of additional land when properly zoned for the use, so long as in the opinion of the Board under stated conditions that the effect upon adjacent areas is protected to the extent feasible and the public interest served. (See Section 10-107C6 for Authorized Variances.)

106 Status of Existing Permitted and Conditional Uses.
A. The following procedures are to be followed to determine the status of existing permitted and conditional uses after their reclassification as lawful permitted, special or conditional uses in these regulations to avoid nonconformities and to provide equitable conversions of such uses:
1. Where a use existed prior to the effective date of these regulations and was previously permitted as a conditional use, i.e., considered for a recommendation by the Planning Commission and approved by the Governing Body, such uses shall not be deemed to be nonconforming, but shall, without further action, be deemed to be a lawful special or conditional use as now classified with the same conditions applicable as originally established, unless reclassified now as a permitted use.*
Enlargement, extension or alterations to existing structures or land improvements for expansion of such lawful uses may be made within the area of the zoning lot which was actually used or occupied for such use on the effective date of these regulations and shall be subject to all requirements set forth in these regulations as a permitted use, unless application is made for a special or conditional use to enlarge, extend or alter structures or land improvements beyond the area heretofore described.
107 Registration of Nonconformities and Exemptions. (See Sections 8-100D for Nonconformities and 3-100E for Exemptions.)
A. Purpose. Registration of nonconformities and exemptions, among other purposes, is to provide a property owner with a record of their nonconformity or exemption which may be in effect for many years. Such a record is very desirable since most nonconformities or exemptions are established in the past and the availability of personal witnesses and written documentation to confirm their status becomes more difficult due to the passage of time. This is particularly important since the person claiming the nonconformity or exemption has the burden to prove their claim by the preponderance of the evidence. Registration can be especially useful to property owners who may have a nonconformity or exemption created by changing their zoning status from the unincorporated area of a county to the City regulations.
______________
* NOTE: As an aid to the administration and enforcement of this provision, the Zoning Administrator shall inventory and prepare a permanent map and file of all previous conditional uses approved by the Planning Commission with conditions attached.

All rights reserved.
B. Rights Conditioned. A lawfully established nonconformity including exemptions is a vested right protected by due process which is sometimes referred to as being "grandfathered-in". In order to establish such a right, it is essential that it be created or commenced prior to the enactment of the regulations which restricted its establishment. A nonconformity or exemption which violated the zoning regulations at its inception has no lawful right to continue. Once the validity of the nonconformity or exemption has been determined, it has the right to be sold, inherited, transferred or assigned unless restricted by a condition attached to a special or conditional use. Certain limitations, however, may be placed on the expansion, repair, maintenance and continuance of such nonconformities or exemption as may be determined by the provisions of Article 8 in these regulations. For example, continuance may be subject to abandonment or limited amortization of certain uses.
C. Registration Process. The Zoning Administrator shall establish a process for registration of nonconformities and exemptions and a system for making determinations thereof and keeping records of the same. While there shall be no deadline for registration, property owners anticipating the need for registration should do so at their earliest convenience.
D. Registration Determination. The Zoning Administrator shall determine the qualifications of the lot, use or structure for registration as to its legal, nonconforming status. Such determination in writing shall be based on the evidence submitted by the property owner requesting the registration.
E. Appeal. An aggrieved party may appeal the Zoning Administrator's determination whether to register or not register the nonconformity or exemption to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (See Section 10-106 pertaining to Appeals.)

101 Zoning Permits and Occupancy Certificates.*
A. Zoning Permits.
1. Unless a zoning permit shall first have been obtained from the Zoning Administrator, the construction, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration of any building or structure or the improvement of land prior to its use or the use of any land or structure being changed to any other use, shall not be commenced. For permits required on accessory uses, temporary uses, home occupations, plans for parking and loading space and signs, see Articles 5, 6 and 7. Such permits shall not be issued by any other official, employee, department, board or agency of the City, except as provided for as a temporary permit in Section 6-101. Any zoning permit issued in conflict with the provisions of these regulations shall be null and void. (See Section 8-103H for Change in Use.)
2. Except for a continuation of an existing use or occupancy, accessory structures or uses, or additions to existing structures or uses, permits must also meet the requirements of the City Subdivision Regulations and, thus, shall not be issued on land which is not shown on a recorded plat or replat, or a lot split or exempted from the platting requirements. If platting or replatting is not required, all of the public improvements necessary to carry out the requested permit nevertheless may be required, including dedications in lieu of platting such as for easements and additional rights of way.
.
3. No principal or accessory building or structure or use, or portion thereof, shall be permitted to locate on or project over any platted or recorded public easement or over any known utility installation, unless (1) as a sign permitted by Section 7-102K or (2) as an accessory structure or use which is moveable, relocatable or poses no significant problem to the maintenance of existing public improvement installations or to such future installations. Ground level extensions such as concrete slabs or other permanent-type materials are not permitted in or on a public easement except as extensions of parking spaces, driveways or sidewalks for which a zoning permit has been or is being issued. In any event, when such structures or uses are permitted to be located on or project over such easements, the property owner assumes the risk and liability for any reconstruction or replacement necessary including fences if any maintenance or other improvements are required by a governmental agency or a utility provider.
4. A zoning permit is not initially required for grading and/or excavating a proposed construction site, unless the site is located in a designated floodplain and would result in an increase in flood levels. (See Appendix for Floodplain Management Regulations.)
______________
* The City may issue zoning permits and occupancy certificates concurrently with the process of issuing building and occupancy permits under City building codes.

All rights reserved.
5. As a supplement to issuing permit for all new and existing single family or duplex dwelling units, the Zoning Administrator shall provide the applicant with information provided by the City Tree Board to encourage the occupant of the zoning lot to plant appropriate street trees within the parking area of the public right of way as well as on the private property. The applicant shall certify as part of the permit process that such information has been conveyed to the occupant.
6. Application. Every application for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by the following:
a. A drawing or copy of the recorded plat, in duplicate, of the piece or parcel of land, lot(s), block(s), parts or portions thereof, drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the zoning lot(s), including any easements thereon.
b. A drawing, in duplicate, drawn to scale and in such form as may, from time to time, be prescribed by the Zoning Administrator, showing the location, ground area, height and bulk of (1) all present and proposed structures, (2) drives, parking spaces and loading areas, (3) building setback lines in relation to lot lines, (4) waste disposal areas, (5) use to be made of such present and proposed structures on the land, and (6) such other information as may be required for the proper enforcement of these regulations.
One copy of such drawings shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator as a public record.
7. Issuance. A zoning permit shall be either issued or disapproved by the Zoning Administrator within 10 days after the receipt of an application thereof or within such further period as may be agreed to by the applicant. When the Administrator refuses to issue a zoning permit, he shall advise the applicant in writing of the reasons for the disapproval.
8. Period of Validity. A zoning permit shall become null and void 180 days after the date on which it is issued, unless within said period construction, reconstruction, moving or structural alteration of a structure is commenced or a use is commenced. If the construction or work is abandoned or suspended for any 180-day period after such a permit is issued, then application must be made to the Zoning Administrator for an extension of time to continue the project. The Zoning Administrator may grant reasonable extensions of time provided no changes have been made in any applicable regulations. If such changes have occurred, application must be made for a new permit based on the provisions of the new or amended regulations in order to continue the project, unless Section 2-101G applies pertaining to vesting of single-family residential developments. (See Section 2-101F for Effect of Existing Permits.)

B. Occupancy Certificates. No structure or addition thereto constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered after the effective date of these regulations shall be occupied or used for any purpose; and no land vacant on the effective date of these regulations shall be used for any purpose; and no use of any land or structure shall be changed to any other use, unless an occupancy certificate shall first have been obtained from the Zoning Administrator certifying that the proposed use or occupancy complies with all the provisions of these regulations.
1. Application. Every application for a zoning permit shall be deemed to be an application for an occupancy certificate. Every occupancy certificate shall be in such form and contain such information as the Administrator shall provide by general rule.
2. Issuance.
a. No occupancy certificate for a structure or addition thereto constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered or for the new or changed use of any structure or land shall be issued after the effective date of these regulations until such work has been completed and the premises inspected and certified by the Zoning Administrator to be in full and complete compliance with the plans and specifications upon which the zoning permit was issued including the requirements for utilities, streets and other public improvements in the City Subdivision Regulations which must either be installed or guaranteed. Direct access must be available from the frontage of each zoning lot to an opened public street or otherwise the street improvement must be guaranteed by such methods as stated in the Subdivision Regulations.
b. An occupancy certificate shall be issued or written notice shall be given to the applicant stating the reasons why a certificate cannot be issued within 10 days after the receipt of an application therefore or after the Zoning Administrator is notified in writing that the structures or premises are ready for occupancy or use. Pending the issuance of a permanent occupancy certificate, a temporary occupancy certificate may be issued to be valid for a period not to exceed six months from its date pending the completion of any addition or improvement(s) or during partial occupancy of the premises; provided, satisfactory guarantees are submitted including the possible use of performance bonds or escrow accounts.
C. Agricultural Compliance Certificate. Completion of an agricultural compliance certificate may be requested by the Zoning Administrator when such information is needed to determine the agricultural exemption status described in Section 2-102. No fees shall apply to obtaining this certificate from the Administrator.

102 Enforcement and Liability.
A. It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator or any deputies working under his direction to enforce the provisions of these regulations in consultation with the City Attorney in the following manner:

ARTICLE 10. BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
100 Authorization. The Planning Commission as previously established by the Governing Body has been designated to also serve as the Board of Zoning Appeals as prescribed by K.S.A. 12-759, as amended, and hereinafter in this Article will be referred to as the "Board."
101 General Procedures. All members of the Planning Commission are voting members of the Board whether they reside inside or outside the city limits and shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for expenses when authorized by the Governing Body. All officers of the Planning Commission are officers of the Board including the Secretary. Public records shall be kept of all official actions of the Board which shall be maintained separately from the Planning Commission by the Secretary. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing evidence presented, findings of fact, decisions and the vote of each member upon each question. If absent, abstaining or disqualified from voting, such fact shall be indicated. Special meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine in its bylaws. Board meetings may be held separately from a Planning Commission meeting or in conjunction with such a meeting wherein the Planning Commission may recess a portion of its meeting to conduct business of the Board and to reconvene to continue the Planning Commission agenda. When a quorum is declared present, all actions of the Board including appeals, variances and conditional uses as exceptions shall be made by motion and decided by a majority vote of the members present and voting.
The Board shall adopt rules for its operation in the form of bylaws which shall include hearing procedures and will not be in conflict with the ordinance designating the Planning Commission as the Board, the applicable state statutes and the provisions of these regulations. Such bylaws shall be subject to the approval of the Governing Body. The Governing Body shall establish a scale of reasonable fees to be paid in advance by the appealing party.
102 Jurisdiction. The Board shall have the following jurisdiction and authority as a quasi-judicial body:
1. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination (all hereinafter referred to collectively as "decision") made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of these regulations subject to the procedure and standards set out in Section 10-106.
2. To hear and decide on variances from specific terms of these regulations subject to the procedure and standards set out in Section 10-107.
3. To hear and decide on conditional uses as exceptions subject to the procedure and standards set out in Section 10-108.

All rights reserved.
103. Notice of Hearing. For the hearing on each appeal for a decision, variance or conditional use, public notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, the legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration, and a brief description of the subject of such hearing shall be published once in the official newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date for the hearing. All notices shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and shall indicate where such information is available when only a general description of the property is provided in the notice. A copy of such notice shall be mailed to each party making the appeal and to the Secretary of the Planning Commission.
For land inside the city limits, the Board shall also provide notice to all owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the property under consideration both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary. If the applicant's property is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the area of notification in addition to the 200 feet inside the City, shall be extended to 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits, the area of notification shall extend for 1,000 feet and, if such notification extends into the city limits, then 200 feet inside the city limits must also be included. Such notice shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date. A list of such owners of record of real property with their addresses and zip codes shall be provided by the applicant. Failure to receive such notice after it has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Board. If there is no quorum present for the meeting or at the time of the hearing, the members in attendance may agree to hold another meeting in the future at a stated date, time, and place for which, when announced at the present meeting, no further public notice need be given.
The Board may give additional notice to other persons as it may from time to time provide by its rules. Such rules may include requirements for additional notice to be provided for by the posting of signs on the property to be considered in the appeal application.
104 Conduct of Hearing. The Board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing on each appeal of a decision, variance or conditional use as an exception. All hearings shall be open to the public; however, when hearing such appeals the Board exercises quasi-judicial functions and, thus, may upon proper motion proceed to deliberate in closed session according to K.S.A. 75-4318(a). No binding action may be taken and all voting must be conducted in an open meeting. Any person may appear and testify at a hearing, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney. Every decision of the Board shall be filed without unreasonable delay with the Zoning Administrator and shall be open to public inspection during reasonable business hours.

105 Finality and Judicial Review of Decisions. Any order or determination of the Board on an appeal for a decision, a variance or a conditional use as an exception, shall be final decisions and shall be subject to judicial review, but not appealable to the Planning Commission or the Governing Body. Any person, official or governmental agency, jointly or separately dissatisfied by any decision of the Board, may present to the County District Court, a petition, duly verified, stating that such decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality and asking for relief therefrom based on a determination of the reasonableness of any such order or determination. Such petition shall be filed with the Court within 30 days after the date of filing the final decision with the Zoning Administrator.
106 Appeals. An appeal from a decision of the Zoning Administrator with respect to the interpretation, application or enforcement of these regulations may be taken to the Board by any person aggrieved, or by any officer of the City, county or any governmental agency or body affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator.
A. Time for Appeals. Appeals shall be made within 30 days after a decision has been made by the Zoning Administrator by filing an application for appeal. Upon the Chairperson's receipt of an application for appeal and notification to the Zoning Administrator, the Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Chairperson all of the papers constituting the record upon which the decision being appealed was based.
B. Application. An application for an appeal shall (1) be filed with the Chairperson, (2) specify the grounds for such an appeal, (3) include the legal description of any property involved with the appeal, (4) be accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (5) provide such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Board.
C. Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board, after the application for appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on petition with notice to the Zoning Administrator and on the basis of due cause shown.
D. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such an appeal shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103 and 104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records required by Section 10-101.

All rights reserved.
E. Decision. The Board may affirm or reverse, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning Administrator, and may issue or direct the issuance of a zoning permit and/or occupancy certificate. No conditions may be attached to such a decision that could not otherwise have been available to the Zoning Administrator in making his initial decision. The Board shall render a written decision in the form of a resolution on the appeal without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing and, in all cases, within 45 days after the close of the hearing.
107 Variances. The Board may authorize such variances from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest and provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Variances may be authorized only in those specific instances enumerated in Section 10-107C and then only when the Board has made findings of fact based upon the standards set out in Section 10-107D that owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee or occupant of land or structures. According to K.S.A. 12-759(e), any such variance shall not permit any use not permitted by these regulations in the zoning district in which the variance is requested.
A. Application. An application for a variance shall (1) be filed with the Zoning Administrator, (2) provide the legal description of the property involved with the variance, (3) be accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (4) contain the following information as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Board:
1. The particular requirements of these regulations which prevent the proposed use or construction;
2. The characteristics of the subject property which prevent compliance with the requirements of these regulations;
3. The reduction of the minimum requirements of these regulations which would be necessary to permit the proposed use or construction; and
4. The particular hardship which would result if the particular requirements of these regulations were applied to the subject property.
5. Submit a sketch drawn to scale showing the lot(s) included in the application, the structures existing thereon and the structures proposed that necessitate the request.
B. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such a variance shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103 and 104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records required by Section 10-101.

All rights reserved.
C. Authorized. Variances from the provisions of these regulations shall be granted by the Board only in accordance with the standards set out in Section 10-107D, and may be granted only in the following instances and in no others:
1. To vary the applicable minimum lot area, lot width and lot depth requirements.
2. To vary the applicable bulk regulations, including maximum height and lot coverage and minimum yard requirements.
3. To vary the dimensional provisions for permitted obstructions in required yards including fences in Sections 3-103F.
4. To vary the applicable number of required off-street parking spaces and the amount of off-street loading requirements of Article 5.
5. To vary the applicable dimensional sign provisions of Section 7-102 regarding general standards and Section 7-104 regarding district regulations.
6. To vary the applicable requirements in Sections 10-107C1 through 5 above in conjunction with conditional use applications for nonconforming, nonresidential structures and uses under provisions of Section 8-105.
7. To vary the applicable provisions permitted by the floodplain regulations. (See Appendix for Floodplain Management Regulations.)
D. Standards:
1. The Board may grant a variance upon specific written findings of fact based upon the particular evidence presented to it at the hearing that all the conditions required by K.S.A. 12-759(e) have been met which are listed below:
a. That the variance requested arises from such condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zoning district, and is not created by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant;
b. That granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
c. That strict application of the provisions of these regulations from which a variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
d. That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general welfare; and
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 10-6
All rights reserved.
e. That granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of these regulations.
2. In determining whether the evidence supports the conclusions required by Section 10-107D1, the Board shall consider the extent to which the evidence demonstrates that:
a. The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon or for the owner, lessee or occupant, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of these regulations were literally enforced;
b. The request for a variance is not based exclusively upon a desire of the owner, lessee, occupant or applicant to make more money out of the property;
c. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located; and
d. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion on public streets or roads, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
E. Conditions. In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions upon the premises benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in Section 10-107D which would reduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations, including methods for guaranteeing performance such as are provided for in Section 10-108D. Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a variance which are later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations. If an applicant desires to make a change in a condition at a later date, it is necessary to apply for a rehearing and a decision be made in the same manner as the original variance; however, only the requested condition is to be reconsidered at the hearing.
F. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an application for a variance without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing, but in all cases within 45 days after the close of the hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all actions of the Board with respect to applications for variances in order to properly issue permits.

All rights reserved.
G. Period of Validity. No variance granted by the Board shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board grants the variance, unless within such 180-day period a zoning permit is obtained and the variance requested is started. The Board may grant additional extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written application, without further notice or hearing.
108 Conditional Uses. The Board may grant as an exception to the provisions of these regulations, the establishment of only those conditional uses that are expressly authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district or in one or more zoning districts. No such conditional use shall be granted unless it complies with all of the applicable provisions of these regulations.
A. Application. An application for a conditional use shall (1) be filed with the Zoning Administrator, (2) provide the legal description of the property involved with the conditional use, (3) be accompanied by an ownership list as required by Section 10-103 and the filing fee, and (4) contain the following information as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by rule of the Board:
1. A statement or diagram showing compliance with any special conditions or requirements imposed upon the particular conditional use by the applicable district regulations or Section 10-108D if applicable;
2. A statement as to why the proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood;
3. A statement as to how the proposed conditional use is to be designed, arranged and operated in order to permit the development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations; and
4. Present data in support of the standards specified in Section 10-108C.
5. Submit a sketch drawn to scale showing the lot(s) included in the application, the structures existing thereon and the structures proposed which necessitate the request.
B. Hearing and Notice. A hearing on the application for such a conditional use as an exception shall be held and notice thereof given as specified under Sections 10-103 and 104 and which are consistent with the general procedures and records required by Section 10-101.
C. Standards. The Board may grant a conditional use when it makes specific written findings of fact based upon the particular evidence presented to it at the hearing which support conclusions that:
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 10-8
All rights reserved.
1. The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable regulations, including lot size requirements, bulk regulations, use limitations and performance standards; unless a concurrent application is in process for a variance.
2. The proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood.
3. The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that the conditional use will not dominate the immediate neighborhood so as to prevent development and use of neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district regulations. In determining whether the conditional use will so dominate the immediate neighborhood, consideration shall be given to:
a. The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls and fences on the site; and
b. The nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.
4. Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance with the standards set forth in Article 5 of these regulations. Such areas will be screened from adjoining residential uses and located so as to protect such residential uses from injurious effects.
5. Adequate utility, drainage and other such necessary facilities have been installed or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or guarantees.
6. Adequate access roads, entrance and exit drives and/or access control is available or will be provided by platting, dedications and/or guarantees and shall be so designed to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets and roads.

All rights reserved.
D. Conditions. In granting a conditional use, the Board may attach such conditions upon the premises and/or the applicant benefitted by the conditional use as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in Section 10-108C in order to reduce or minimize any potentially injurious affect upon other property in the neighborhood and to carry out the general purpose and intent of these regulations. Such conditions may include, but not be limited to, further restrictions on bulk regulations; time of operation and ownership limitations; screening, landscaping and fencing; provision of utilities, drainage and other public improvements; additional access or access control; off-street parking and loading requirements; and platting, dedications and/or guarantees. In addition to the guarantees referred to below for parking and/or screening, covenants which run with the land or the property to guarantee that conditions will be carried out at a future date may be filed with the County Register of Deeds. Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a conditional use which is later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations. If an applicant desires to make a change in a condition at a later date, it is necessary to apply for a rehearing and a decision be made in the same manner as the original conditional use, only the requested condition is to be reconsidered at the hearing.
In lieu of actual construction of required off-street parking or the initial provisions for screening, the Board may accept, in the name of the City, a corporate surety bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other like security in an amount to be fixed by the Board and conditioned upon actual completion of such improvement within a specified time. Such securities shall be filed with the Clerk. The Governing Body may enforce such securities by all equitable means.
E. Decisions and Records. The Board shall render a written decision containing specific findings of fact in the form of a resolution on an application for a conditional use without unreasonable delay after the close of a hearing, but in all cases within 45 days after the close of the hearing. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain complete records of all actions of the Board with respect to applications for conditional uses in order to properly issue permits.
F. Period of Validity. No conditional use granted by the Board shall be valid for a period longer than 180 days from the date on which the Board grants the conditional use, unless within such period a zoning permit is obtained and the conditional use requested is started. The Board may grant extensions not exceeding 180 days each, upon written application, without further notice of a hearing.

ARTICLE 11. AMENDMENTS
100 General Provisions for Amendments and Special Uses. These regulations and the districts created under the authority of these regulations may be amended from time to time by the Planning Commission following a public hearing and the approval by the Governing Body. No such amendment shall be adopted except in accordance with the procedures of this Article 11. Special use applications are not amendments, but are processed for the hearing in the same manner. (See Section 11-101 for special uses.)
A. Proposal. Amendments or special uses may be proposed: (1) by the Governing Body, (2) by the Planning Commission or (3) upon application by, or on behalf of the owner of the property affected, but only in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 11-100B. When the Governing Body proposes an amendment or special use, it shall transmit its proposal to the Planning Commission for a public hearing and recommendation thereon. (See Section 11-100D3 for special notice of hearing procedure for Governing Body and Planning Commission applications.)
B. Application. When the owner of the property affected proposes an amendment to any of these regulations or to any zoning district created thereby or applies for a special use, an application shall (1) be filed with the Zoning Administrator who refers it to the Planning Commission for a hearing, (2) be in such form and contain such information as shall be prescribed from time to time by the Commission, and (3) in all instances contain the following information:
1. The applicant's name, address and telephone number;
2. The precise wording of any proposed amendment to the text of these regulations or the exact description of the special use requested.
3. In the event that the proposed amendment would change the zoning district classification or add a special use to any specific property:
a. The name, address and telephone number of the owner of the property and, if any, the agent representing the owner;
b. The legal description of the property and a general description such as a street address sufficient to identify the property;
c. The present and proposed zoning district classifications and existing uses of the property and structures thereon;
d. The dimensions of the property and the zoning lot area stated in square feet or acres or fractions thereof; and

All rights reserved.
e. For land inside the city limits, an ownership list of the names, addresses and zip codes of the owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the area described in the application both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary.
f. If such area is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the ownership list, in addition to the 200 feet inside the city limits, shall provide similar information extending to 1,000 feet into the unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits, the ownership list shall extend for 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area and, if the latter extends into the city limits, then such owners for 200 feet inside the city must also be included on the list.
C. Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on each proposed amendment that is filed with, referred to, or initiated by the Commission. The Commission shall select a reasonable time and place for such public hearing, and it shall hold such hearing within 45 days from the date on which the proposed amendment is received or initiated. An applicant for an amendment may waive the requirement that such hearing be held within 45 days.
D. Notice of Hearing. One of the following three procedures shall be selected to provide proper notice for a public hearing for any zoning amendment application:
1. Public notice of a hearing by the Planning Commission on a proposed amendment shall be published once in the official newspaper by the Zoning Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice shall state the date, time and place of the hearing and shall contain a statement regarding the proposed changes in regulations or the zoning classification or zoning district boundaries of any property. If the proposed amendment would change the zoning classification of any specific property or the boundaries of any zoning district, such notice shall contain the legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration. If a general description is used, the notice shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and where such description is available.

All rights reserved.
In addition to such publication notice, the Zoning Administrator shall mail a written notice of the hearing containing information similar to the published notice thereof to the applicant and to the owners of record of all real property within the area to be altered or changed and to all owners of record of real property located within 200 feet of the exterior boundary of the area described in the amendment application both within the city limits and extending outside the city limits when necessary. If such area is located adjacent to but within the city limits, the area of notification shall, in addition to the 200 feet inside the city limits, be extended to 1,000 feet in the unincorporated area. If such area is located outside the city limits, the area of notification shall extend for 1,000 feet and, if such notification extends into the city limits, then 200 feet inside the city limits must also be included. The notice to adjacent property owners including the applicant shall be mailed so that 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Commission or the Governing Body.
2. Whenever five or more owners of record of real property owning 10 or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts or parcels of the same zoning classification initiate a rezoning of their property from a less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification, such amendment shall require notice by publication only and hearing in like manner as required by Section 11-100C. Such zoning amendment shall not require written notice and shall not be subject to the protest petition provision of Section 11-103.
3. Whenever the Governing Body or the Planning Commission initiates a rezoning from a less restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification of 10 or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots, tracts or parcels of the same zoning classification having five or more owners of record of real property, such amendment shall require notice by publication and hearing in like manner as that required by Section 11-100C. In addition, written notice shall be required to be mailed to only owners of record of real properties to be rezoned and only such owners shall be eligible to initiate a protest petition under Section 11-103.
The Commission may give additional notice to other persons as it may from time to time provide by its rules. Such rules may include requirements for additional notice to be provided for by the posting of signs on the property to be considered in the amendment application.

No binding action can be taken in such a session and all voting must be conducted in an open meeting.
2. Any interested person or party may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent or by attorney.
3. The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner and according to such procedures as the Commission may from time to time prescribe by rule or bylaws which are not in conflict with these regulations or applicable state statutes.
4. The Commission shall keep minutes of the proceedings showing evidence presented at hearings, findings of fact by the Commission, motions made and the vote of each member upon any question or recommendation. If a member is absent, abstains or disqualified, such fact shall be indicated.
5. The Commission may request a report on any proposed amendment from any governmental official or agency, or any other person, firm or corporation. If such a report is made, a copy thereof shall be made available to the applicant and any other interested person prior to or at the public hearing.
6. The Commission may make recommendations on proposed amendments to specific properties which affect only a portion of the land described in the hearing notice or which give all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice. A recommendation for a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice shall not be valid, however, without republication and, where necessary, re-mailing of notices, unless the Commission shall have previously established a table or publication available to the public which designates what zoning classifications are lesser changes authorized within the published zoning classifications.

7. For action on zoning amendments, a quorum of the Commission must be more than one-half of the membership as established by ordinance. A majority vote of the members of the Commission present at the hearing shall be required to recommend approval or disapproval of the amendment to the Governing Body. If the Commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request, the Commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval.
8. A hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue in the future at some stated date, time and place. At the conclusion of a hearing, the Commission shall prepare its findings and the factors on which to base its recommendation and vote.
9. If a meeting is called or a hearing is on the agenda and no quorum is present, the members in attendance may agree to hold the hearing at another meeting in the future at a stated date, time and place or at the next regular meeting for which, when announced at the present scheduled meeting, no further public notice need be given to continue the hearing.
F. Report by Planning Commission. Within 14 days after the close of the public portion of the hearing and voting on a proposed amendment or special use, the Planning Commission shall submit a report to the Governing Body. A copy of this report shall also be filed with the Clerk and the Zoning Administrator and such copies shall be kept available for public inspection. A copy of the report shall also be mailed to the applicant. Such report shall contain a recommendation as to whether the proposed amendment or special use should be approved or disapproved and specific written determinations on the items listed in Sections 11-100G or 11-100H and on such other items as the Commission may consider relevant. The report submitted to the Governing Body shall be accompanied by a summary of the hearing as required by K.S.A. 12-756(b). In lieu of a report, the above information may be contained in the minutes of the meeting and submitted to the Governing Body.
G. Amendments to Text. When a proposed amendment by the Governing Body or Planning Commission would result in a change or revision in the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of zoning classification of any specific property, a legislative hearing shall be held by the Commission and the report or minutes shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such proposed amendment.

H. Review Criteria for Amendments or Special Uses. When a proposed rezoning amendment or special use would result in a zoning change for any specific property, the report of the Planning Commission accompanied by a summary of the hearing shall contain statements as to (1) the present and proposed district classifications or description of the special use, (2) the applicant's reasons for requesting such reclassification or special use, and (3) a statement of the factors where relevant upon which the recommendation of the Commission is based using the following criteria as guidelines: *
1. What is the character of the subject property and the surrounding neighborhood in relation to existing uses and their condition?
2. What is the current zoning of the subject property and that of the surrounding neighborhood in relation to the request?
3. Is the length of time that the subject property has remained undeveloped or vacant as zoned a factor in the consideration?
4. Would the request correct an error in the application of these regulations?
5. Is the request caused by changed or changing conditions in the area of the subject property and, if so, what is the nature and significance of such changed or changing conditions?
6. Do adequate sewage disposal and water supply and all other necessary public facilities including street access exist or can they be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the subject property?
7. Would the subject property need to be platted or replatted or in lieu of dedications made for rights-of-way, easements, and access control or building setback lines?
8. Would a screening plan be necessary for existing and/or potential uses of the subject property?
9. Is suitable vacant land or buildings available or not available for development that currently has the same zoning as is requested?
10. If the request is for business or industrial uses, are such uses needed to provide more services or employment opportunities?
11. Is the subject property suitable for the uses in the current zoning to which it has been restricted?
______________
* NOTE: All the factors stated in the decision of Golden v. City of Overland Park, 224 Kan. 591, 584 P.2d 130 (1978) are included in this list. In using these factors as guidelines, modifications may be made in the criteria to more specifically relate them to the particular zoning change in classification or special use.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 11-7
All rights reserved.
12. To what extent would the removal of the restrictions, i.e., the approval of the zoning request detrimentally affect other property in the neighborhood?
13. Would the request be consistent with the purpose of the zoning district classification and the intent and purpose of these regulations?
14. Is the request in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan and does it further enhance the implementation of the Plan?
15. What is the nature of the support or opposition to the request?
16. Is there any information or are there recommendations on this request available from professional persons or persons with related expertise which would be helpful in its evaluation?
17. By comparison, does the relative gain to the public health, safety or general welfare outweigh the loss in property value or the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not approving the request?
Of those factors considered as relevant to the requested change in zoning district classification or boundary or special use, not all factors need to be given equal consideration by the Commission in deciding upon its recommendation.
101 Special Uses. Because of particular factors associated with their activities, certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts, but are allowed as "special uses" when their proposed location is supplemented by additional conditions such as to make the use considered compatible with the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the zoning district.
In granting a special use, the minimum requirements of approval for all similar types of permitted uses in the same district must be met, unless otherwise reduced by a specific reference in these regulations. The requirements may be made more stringent if there is a potentially injurious effect which may be anticipated upon other property and the neighborhood or contrary to the welfare and convenience of the public. Such additional conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirements affecting the lot size or yard dimensions; changing street width; the extent and location of entrance or exit drives; controlling the size, location and number of signs; the period and time of operation; lot coverage and height of buildings; screening, fencing and/or landscaping to protect the surrounding property; establishing environmental standards for air and water pollution, noise, vibration, lighting and other such conditions; protection from flooding; and additional improvements such as street construction, sidewalks, utilities and storm drainage, if necessary, including platting and/or dedications. Such conditions may be placed upon the property which is the subject of the special use application or upon the applicant or both.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015 11-8
All rights reserved.
Although the Official Zoning Map is not amended, the procedure for approval of a special use shall otherwise be the same as for an amendment to change a zoning district classification or boundary which is set forth in Section 11-100 of this Article including the provisions for filing protest petitions in Section 11-103; provided, that any conditions which are further imposed upon the special use shall be made a part of the effectuating ordinance. Applications for a special use shall be accompanied by a plot plan of the proposed development. Concurrent applications may be processed for changing zoning district classifications as amendments and approving special uses on the same property wherein joint notices are advertised and mailed and hearing held; however, separate motions, review criteria and effectuating ordinances are necessary.
Failure to comply with any of the conditions for a special use which are later attached to a zoning permit shall constitute a violation of these regulations. Upon a finding by the Zoning Administrator of such a violation, the zoning permit may be declared null and void. If an applicant desires to make a change in a condition at a later date it is necessary to apply for a rehearing and a decision be made in the same manner as the original special use; however, only the requested condition is to be reconsidered at the hearing.
No special use approval by the Governing Body shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the publication date of the effectuating ordinance unless (1) another time period is designated as a condition attached to the special use; (2) an application is filed and a zoning permit is approved during the period of validity. In such instance the special use shall be valid for the period of validity of the zoning permit. The Governing Body may authorize extensions of the validity period without notice or public hearing for more than one year upon a written request received within a valid period. Upon expiration of any validity period, the effectuating ordinance automatically becomes null and void unless an extension has been granted or a zoning permit has been obtained.
102 Project Review. In the event that certain public improvements, facilities or utilities of a type embraced within the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan are classified as special uses or are the subject of a change in zoning district classification or boundary, the consideration of such uses by the Planning Commission in conjunction with a zoning application may also constitute their project review of such proposed use if concurrently processed under procedures required by K.S.A. 12-748, as amended; provided, that a statement of findings is included in the Commission's approval or disapproval as to whether such proposed use is or is not in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. In case the Commission finds that the proposed use is not in conformance to the Plan and states in writing the manner in which it is not in conformance, then the Governing Body shall not proceed with construction of such a proposed use unless the Governing Body by a majority vote overrides the disapproval of the Commission and the Plan shall be deemed to have been amended and the Commission shall make the necessary changes in the Plan to reflect the vote of the Governing Body.

All rights reserved.
103 Filing of Protest. Whether or not the Planning Commission approves or disapproves a zoning change, if a written protest against a proposed amendment for a specific property or a special use shall be filed in the office of the Clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the hearing by the Commission which is signed and acknowledged and an accurate legal description of their property provided by the owners of record of 20% or more of any real property proposed to be altered or changed, excluding streets or public ways, or by the owners of record of 20% or more of the real property within the total area required in the official area of notification by Section 11-100D, excluding streets and public ways and specific statutorily excluded property as described below, then the effectuating ordinance shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 vote of all the members of the Governing Body. (See Sections 11-100D2 and D3 for protest petition exceptions for rezoning from a lesser restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification.)
Property statutorily excluded by K.S.A. 12-757(f) from determining the sufficiency of a protest petition when calculating the total real property within the notification area is that which was (1) requested by the owner of the specific property for rezoning or a special use; or (2) the owner of the specific property requested for rezoning or a special use who does not oppose in writing such rezoning or special use. (See Sections 11-100 D2 and D3 for protest petition exceptions for rezoning from a lesser restrictive to a more restrictive zoning classification.)
104 Adoption of Amendments or Special Uses by the Governing Body. When the Planning Commission in its report submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of a proposed amendment or special use including the basis therefore, the Governing Body may: (1) Adopt such recommendation by an effectuating ordinance; (2) override the Commission's recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the Governing Body; or (3) return such recommendation to the Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendation, the Commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendation giving the reasons therefore or submit a new or amended recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by the effectuating ordinance or it need take no further action thereon. If the Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the Governing Body following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and proceed accordingly.
In considering its decision under each of the above set of circumstances, the Governing Body shall take into account the guidelines in Section 11-100H which are relevant to the proposed amendment or special use and, having reviewed the Commission's findings of fact and the factors upon which their recommendation is based, the Governing Body either adopts the Commission's findings and factors by reference or records their own findings of fact and the factors upon which their decision is based.

All rights reserved.
The proposed amendment or special use shall become effective upon publication of their respective adopting ordinance. If such an amendment affects the classification or boundaries of any zoning district, the respective ordinance shall legally describe the classification or boundaries as amended, shall order the Official Zoning Map to be changed to reflect such amendment, and shall reincorporate such map as amended.
105 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations including the Official Zoning Map(s), the Planning Commission shall annually hold a public review at their first regular meeting in February to consider amendments, if any, to these regulations. Preceding such a review, the Governing Body and other affected governmental agencies and interested parties should be notified of the intent to review and their ideas requested. In preparation for such a review, the Zoning Administrator shall maintain a master copy of the current zoning regulations on which are recorded comments and ideas brought to the attention of the Administrator during the preceding year in order to maintain the intent and purpose of these regulations under changing conditions and to implement the Comprehensive Plan. Information on any relevant changes in state statutes shall be compiled for the review.
106 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance, regulation, amendment, special use or other zoning decision provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an action against the City within 30 days after a final decision is made by the City. In the event that an amendment to these regulations or a special use is approved by the Governing Body, the 30-day period commences when the effectuating ordinance is published. Such action shall be brought in the County District Court.
According to K.S.A. 12-757(a), if a proposed amendment is not a general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, such an amendment shall be presumed to be reasonable if it is in accordance with the land use plan or the land use element of the comprehensive plan.

ARTICLE 12. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE
100 Severability. If any provisions of these regulations are held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be considered separately and apart from the remaining provisions of these regulations, so as to be completely severable and the remaining provisions of these regulations shall remain in full force and effect.
101 Effective Date. These regulations shall be in full force and effect from and after their adoption by the Planning Commission, approval by the Governing Body by an ordinance incorporating these regulations by reference as a model code in book form and publication of such ordinance in the official city newspaper.

APPENDIX
TABLE OF COMPARABILITY FOR ZONING DISTRICTS
In accordance with provisions provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(b) and in Section 11-100E6 of the Zoning Regulations of the City of Sterling, Kansas, the Sterling City Planning Commission hereby establishes a "Table of Comparability for Zoning Districts" as listed below. This table designates the zoning districts which are considered to be "lesser changes" due to their more restrictive characteristics as set forth in the Zoning Regulations.
When considering zoning district amendments, the Planning Commission and the Governing Body may recommend and approve a lesser change in zoning districts for the property already advertised for a public hearing without republication of a notice or redistribution of notices to property owners when such change is more restrictive than the district which is applied for as shown on the table below; provided, however, that such recommendation and approval shall not be for a lesser classification than the existing zoning district. If the applicant at the Governing Body meeting at which a zoning amendment is being considered desires to amend the application and/or the Governing Body desires to consider a "lesser" zoning change, then such a proposed change shall be returned to the Planning Commission for reconsideration and further recommendation to the Governing Body without further publication or notice as provided for in K.S.A. 12-757(c) and in Section 11-104 of the Zoning Regulations.
MOST RESTRICTIVE: R-1 Single-Family Residential District
R-2 Multiple-Family Residential District
B-1 General Business District
B-2 Central Business District
LEAST RESTRICTIVE: I-1 Heavy Industrial District
Because of the uniqueness and special purpose for which the MH-1 Manufactured Home Park, P-O Protective Overlay, PUD Planned Unit Development and C-O College Overlay districts serve, these districts are excluded from the Table of Comparability as well as the overlay zones established by the Floodplain Management Regulations.

All rights reserved.
EXAMPLE: If an application is advertised for a public hearing requesting a change from a R-1 Residential District to an I-1 Industrial District, the Planning Commission may recommend the lesser, i.e., more restrictive B-1 Business District without republication or mailing of new notices.
If an application, however, is advertised for public hearing requesting a change from the existing B-1 Business District to the I-1 Industrial District, the recommending of the lesser R-1 Residential District shall not be valid without republication and the mailing of new notices.
Although the notification for a "Special Use" is processed in the same manner as a zoning district amendment, it is not an actual change in zoning districts and, therefore, the Table of Comparability does not apply and reapplication is necessary for consideration of a different "Use" even if in the same zone. Part of the property considered for a Special Use, however, may be withdrawn by the applicant or a lesser amount recommended for approval without renotification.

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
of the
CITY OF STERLING, KANSAS
ARTICLE 1. TITLE, PURPOSE, AUTHORITY, JURISDICTION, APPLICABILITY AND EXEMPTIONS
100 Title. These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision Regulations of the City of Sterling, Kansas", and shall hereinafter be referred to as "these regulations."
101 Purpose. Responsible land subdivision is the initial step in the process of orderly community development. Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is difficult and costly. These regulations are designed and intended to serve the following purposes:
A. To provide for the harmonious development of the City of Sterling and for a portion of the surrounding unincorporated area of Rice County;
B. To provide for (1) desirable lot layouts, (2) efficient and orderly location of streets and roadways and the extent and manner in which they shall be improved, and (3) storm water drainage;
C. To provide for adequate water supply, sewage disposal, various utility services and other improvements to protect public health, safety and general welfare;
D. To provide for and secure to the proper governmental agencies the actual construction of all such necessary on-site and off-site public improvements including the reservation or dedication of land for park and recreational purposes;
E. To provide protection from periodic flooding conditions;
F. To reserve or dedicate land for open space to preserve natural areas for water-courses, drainage ways, wetlands, woodland, rugged topography, wildlife habitat, and for water quality and quantity, and to protect land from soil erosion;
G. To avoid water and air pollution and the congestion of population and traffic;
H. To facilitate safety by adequate access for firefighting equipment and police protection;
I. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning regulations, various construction codes and other City and County regulations which also affect the development of the land;

All rights reserved.
J. To establish administrative procedures necessary to assure a fair and uniform basis for a working relationship with subdividers, utility providers and various governmental agencies, all of whom are contributing to the development of the community; and
K. To realize the goals, policies and planning proposals as contained in the adopted Comprehensive Development Plan.
102 Authority. These regulations are adopted under authority established by K.S.A., 12-741 et seq., as amended, 12-3009 to 12-3012 inclusive, 12-3301 and 12-3302.
103 Subdivision Jurisdiction. These regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land within the corporate limits of the City of Sterling as presently exists or are hereinafter established by annexation.
All such land is included in the Planning Area for the Comprehensive Development Plan which has been adopted by the Planning Commission and approved by the Governing Body.
104 Applicability. The owner(s) of any land within the jurisdiction of these regulations desiring to vacate rights of way, easements, other public reservations or recorded plats or to:
A. Divide or further divide land into two or more lots or parcels; or
B. Otherwise alter the boundaries of lots or parcels of land; or
C. Establish land for use as streets, alleys or other property intended for public use or for the use of a purchaser or owner(s) of lots or parcels;
shall cause a plat to be made in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, unless exempted under Section 1-105.
105 Exemptions. Notwithstanding the requirements of Sections 1-103 and 104, these regulations shall not apply in the following instances or transactions:
A. Whenever any lot, parcel or tract of land located within the area governed by these regulations has been legally subdivided, resubdivided or replatted and recorded prior to the effective date of these regulations.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015. 1-3
All rights reserved.
B. The division of land in the unincorporated area which creates no more than one additional lot or tract of land than specified in Section 1-105A, and which (1) does not involve any new streets or easements of access; (2) is not located in a floodable area as determined by Section 6-104 of these regulations; (3) is to be used for agricultural or single-family residential purposes only; (4) meets the standards set by these regulations for the disposal of sewage and for water supply including lot size; (5) conforms with any applicable zoning regulations; and (6) no part of the lot area shall be located closer than 300 feet to the city limits. Dedications to widen rights of way to meet standards established in the Comprehensive Plan may be required at such time as application is made for a building and/or zoning permit.

Fifteen copies of the sketch plan should be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator in a simple format sufficient to convey the location of proposed streets and utilities, the general layout of lots, and to note any particular design situations which could benefit from an early discussion of the problems. One copy of the sketch plan shall be returned to the subdivider with notations marked as to the comments resulting from such a review process. No fee shall be charged for the sketch plan review.
101 Filing of Preliminary Plat. An application shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator at least 30 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission and such number of copies of the preliminary plat as may be determined necessary by the Administrator for proper review by affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations.

A lack of response in 15 days shall, at the discretion of the Commission, signify approval, unless during this period a written request for an extension of one time only not to exceed 15 days is submitted to the Commission.
103 Action by the Planning Commission on Preliminary Plat. The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plat and consider the comments and recommendations of the organizations to whom the preliminary plat had been submitted for review. If deemed desirable, the Commission may mail notices or copies of agendas to interested parties and conduct a public hearing for the purpose of receiving information supporting or opposing the preliminary plat.
A. The Planning Commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat generally meets the design standards and requirements of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan, the applicable zoning regulations and other applicable provisions of the ordinances of the City.
B. If satisfied, the Planning Commission shall approve the preliminary plat with or without conditions by a majority vote of the members present and voting, and so notify the subdivider in writing.

All rights reserved.
C. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the foregoing conditions, it may suggest modifications so as to satisfy such conditions and in such event:
1. The subdivider may amend the preliminary plat so as to incorporate such modifications and resubmit the plat to the Commission, which shall then grant its approval if such amendments satisfactorily incorporate the suggested modifications; or
2. The subdivider may reject the suggested modifications or, within the time allowed for Commission action, may refrain from taking any action thereon. In either event, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been disapproved and the Commission shall thereupon furnish the subdivider with a written statement setting forth the reasons for disapproval of the preliminary plat.
D. If the Planning Commission determines that the preliminary plat does not satisfy the conditions of these regulations and that modifications would be too extensive or impractical, it shall disapprove the preliminary plat and immediately notify the subdivider in writing of its action, all within 60 days.
104 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Preliminary Plat. If the Planning Commission fails to approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within 60 days after the date such plat is filed with the Subdivision Administrator or from the date the subdivider has filed the last item of required data, whichever date is later, then such preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been approved, unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation.
105 Effect of Approval of Preliminary Plat.
A. Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the subdivision by the Planning Commission, but shall signify in general the acceptability of the proposed subdivision.
B. Such approval shall be considered permission to submit the final plat accompanied by the information required by Section 5-101R.
C. Such approval shall be effective for no more than 12 months from the date approval was granted, unless, upon application from the subdivider, the Planning Commission grants an extension of time beyond such period. If a final plat for the entire subdivision or a unit thereof has not been filed with the Subdivision Administrator within such period, or any extensions granted thereto, the preliminary plat must be resubmitted to the Commission as if such plat had never been approved, except that no additional fee shall be charged for such resubmittal if there are no substantive changes from the previous preliminary plat approval.

106 Filing of Final Plat. An application for final plat approval, together with a sufficient number of copies as determined by the Subdivision Administrator for proper review, shall be filed with the Administrator at least 20 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission and within 12 months after the date that the preliminary plat has been approved. The Administrator shall transmit the final plat to the Commission and to other affected and interested governmental and public and private organizations as desirable for any further recommendations. The final plat shall contain the information as set out in Section 5-101 of these regulations. An application for a replat approval is processed in the same manner as a final plat. (See Section 2-102 for definition of a REPLAT under the heading of PLAT.)
107 Planning Commission Action on the Final Plat. The Planning Commission shall, within 60 days after the first meeting of the Commission following the date that the plat with all required data is filed with the Subdivision Administrator, review and approve the final plat by a majority vote of the members present and voting if:
A. It is substantially the same as the approved preliminary plat; or
B. There has been compliance with all conditions which may have been attached to the approval of the preliminary plat; and
C. It complies with all of the provisions contained in these regulations and of other applicable regulations or laws.
108 Failure of Planning Commission to Act on Final Plat. If the Planning Commission fails to approve or disapprove the final plat within the 60 days designated by state law for its consideration as stated in Section 4-107, it shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate shall be issued by the Secretary upon demand, unless the subdivider shall have consented in writing to extend or waive such time limitation. (See K.S.A. 12-752[b].)
109 Submittal to Governing Body of Final Plat. Before a final plat is recorded, it shall be submitted to the Governing Body for its acceptance of dedications for street rights of way and other public ways, drainage and utility easements, and any land dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the installation of required improvements according to Section 7-104.
110 Governing Body Action on Final Plat. The Governing Body shall either accept or not accept the dedication of any land for public purposes by a majority vote within 30 days after the first meeting of the Governing Body following the date of the submission of the plat to the Clerk. The Governing Body may defer action for an additional 30 days for the purpose of allowing for modifications to comply with the requirements established by the Governing Body. If the Governing Body defers action on the plat or declines to accept the dedications thereto, it shall advise the Planning Commission and the subdivider in writing of the reasons therefor. Acceptance of the dedications on the plat shall be shown over the signature of the Mayor and attested to by the Clerk.

111 Acceptance of Dedications by County. All final plats outside the City shall also be submitted by the subdivider to the appropriate County official for presentation to the Board of County Commissioners for their acceptance of dedications for street rights of way and other public ways, drainage and utility easements, and any land dedicated for public use and accompanied by guarantees for the installation of required improvements according to Section 7-104.
112 Recording of Final Plat. The final plat with all required signatures and in the exact form as accepted by the Governing Body shall be recorded by the subdivider with the County Register of Deeds. The subdivider shall pay the recording fee and any outstanding real estate taxes and special assessments. Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commis-sion and acceptance by the Governing Body shall be null and void if (1) the plat is not acceptable for recording in the office of the Register of Deeds; or (2) is not recorded within 60 days after final acceptance by the Governing Body; or (3) is not recorded within 15 days after final acceptance by the applicable County Governing Body under the preconstruction procedures of Section 7-104C. The subdivider shall submit to the Subdivision Administrator such number of copies of the recorded plat as are necessary for record keeping purposes of the City and other affected governmental agencies as well as a DWG or DXF file and a PDF file. (See Section 5-101R1 for title report and Section 10-100C for Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.)
113 Unit Developments. The foregoing provisions of these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, an approved preliminary plat may be submitted for final approval in separate geographic units rather than as a whole, provided the following conditions are met:
A. Each unit of a plat of subdivision shall contain an area of sufficient size based on physical conditions and ability to install improvements economically.
B. The approval of the Planning Commission as to the feasibility of such development, in separate units, including the feasibility of the proposed sequence of development, shall be secured.
C. A final plat of at least one unit shall be filed within 12 months from the date of approval of the preliminary plat, and final plats of all such units shall be filed within five years from the date that the preliminary plat was approved. The Planning Commission on application of the subdivider, may, from time to time, grant extensions of time within which to submit such final plats, provided that each such extension shall be for no more than one year.
D. All steps required for the approval of final plats, including the recording thereof, shall be adhered to with respect to each unit so submitted.
E. A replat of all or a portion of a recorded final plat may be submitted at any time.

114 Approval of Plats for Small Tracts.
A. Authorization. Any other provision of these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, if a proposed plat of subdivision or resubdivision complies with the requirements of Section 4-114B, then the Planning Commission may approve a final plat of such subdivision or resubdivision when neither a sketch plan nor a preliminary plat has been filed by the subdivider and a preliminary plat has not been approved by the Planning Commission.
B. Requirements. In order to qualify for approval in the manner provided in Section 4-114A, a proposed plat of subdivision shall comply with the following requirements:
1. The proposed plat of subdivision shall include not more than 10 acres if a residential plat, nor more than five acres for any other type of plat, unless approved for a larger acreage by the Planning Commission.
2. The proposed plat of subdivision shall create not more than five lots, tracts or parcels of land, unless approved for a larger number by the Planning Commission.
3. No public street or easement of access, e.g., a utility or drainage easement, is sought to be dedicated or is contemplated or projected through (as opposed to adjacent to) the lot, tract or parcel proposed to be subdivided or resubdivided.
4. The proposed plat of subdivision shall be in the form required by Section 5-101 and shall contain all the data, information and certificates required on final plats as well as the supplemental information.
5. Submission of the fees as required by Section 3-109.
C. Procedures.
1. Final plats filed for approval pursuant to Section 4-114 shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator who may submit such plat for review and recommendations to affected and interested governmental agencies and public and private utility providers as deemed desirable. The Administrator may require the subdivider to submit topographic information whenever the property proposed to be subdivided or resubdivided is traversed by or is adjacent to a known watercourse, including intermittent streams or is subject to flooding as defined in Section 6-104.
2. The approval of final plats by the Planning Commission pursuant to Section 4-114 shall be subject to the same procedural provisions of a final plat, except insofar as the said sections require prior approval of, or compliance with, an approved preliminary plat.

10. Subdivisions which lie outside the city limits for which requests have been made for the extension of one or more City utility services shall agree to a waiver of protest of potential future annexation by a statement reading "Owners of lands within this subdivision do hereby bind themselves to waive any protest to annexation by the City of Sterling, Kansas," which shall be shown on the final plat and included in restrictive covenants of the subdivision. When such an agreement is contained in such restrictive covenants and filed by the City with the County Register of Deeds within 30 days after being executed by all parties, it shall be deemed to be sufficient consent to annexation under K.S.A. 12-520, as amended, to bind the owner(s) of the land to be subdivided and any successors in interest. (See Section 5-101R3 for restrictive covenants.)
11. Provision for all other certifications, approvals and acceptances which are now, or which may hereafter be, required by any statute, ordinance or regulation. The form of these certifications may be modified as necessary by the City's legal counsel to meet statutory or other requirements.

3. A copy, if any, of restrictive covenants applicable to the subdivision. As a service to the subdivider, such restrictions may be reviewed by the Planning Commission and other officials to determine if any potential conflicts exist with the City's laws.

ARTICLE 6. DESIGN STANDARDS
100 Scope. All subdivision of land subject to these regulations shall conform to the minimum design standards of this Article according to the classifications of urban and rural type subdivisions as defined in Article 7-100.
101 Comprehensive Development Plan. Subdivisions shall conform with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
102 Land for Public Facility Sites. Public agencies using the Comprehensive Plan as a guide may use the following procedure for acquiring sites for public facilities which does not preclude voluntary dedication and mutual negotiations for land or the use of the condemnation laws of the State: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE.)
A. The subdivider offers to sell to the appropriate public body, agency or authority, lands, sites and locations for parks, recreational areas, schools, fire stations or other public facilities. As soon as the preliminary plat has been received and reviewed, the Planning Commission shall give 45 days notice to the public body, agency or authority that it appears that lands should be considered for public acquisition. If within that 45 days the body receiving notice fails to act or submits a negative report on acquisition, then the subdivision and design thereof shall be treated as if no such request for land had been made.
B. If the organization receiving notice replies in writing that they desire to acquire land within the subdivision, they shall have an additional 45 days after making such reply to make arrangements for such land acquisition.
C. The time allocated for making the above determination may be extended with the mutual consent of the subdivider and the organization involved.
103 Land for Open Space. The following conditions may be required as part of the approval of any subdivision plat: (See Section 2-102 for definition of RESERVE and WETLAND.)
A. That the subdivider provide appropriate dedication of land or easements for the preservation of open space areas within a subdivision. Such open space may be needed to preserve areas containing natural watercourses, drainage ways, areas subject to periodic flooding, wetlands, substantial woodland, rugged topography and wildlife habitat; to maintain water quality and quantity; and to protect land from soil erosion. In general, such land is not normally considered as buildable land and should not be developed in order to maintain the quality of the environment.

104 Land Subject to Flooding.
A. Whenever a subdivision of land including platting for manufactured home parks and other developments on one-lot plats is located on flood prone land identified on a Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (F.I.R.M.) prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following requirements shall apply: (See City Zoning Regulations for Floodplain Management Regulations in the City and County Zoning Regulations for floodplain regulations in the unincorporated area.) (See Section 5-101O for minimum pad elevations.)
1. Show on the preliminary and final plats the boundary lines and elevations for both floodway, if any, and base flood elevation; and
2. Assure that (a) all such subdivisions are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, (b) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, water, gas and electrical systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (c) adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
105 Land Subject to Excessive Erosion by Wind or Water. On land subject to excessive soil movement by the forces of wind and/or water and that may cause environmental health hazards, necessary preventive measures shall be a part of the subdivision plat. Conservation standards applicable to subdivisions shall be adhered to which are used by the Rice County Conservation District.
106 Access. All lots located in any subdivision must contain at least 40 feet of frontage in the City and 30 feet in the unincorporated area for driveways directly connected to an opened public street and not across the land of others. Flag lots are not permitted, unless warranted by an unusual shape of the land or the ownership of property. (See Section 2-102 for definition of FLAG LOT.)
107 Streets-Layout and Design.
A. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the intent of the Comprehensive Plan, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjoining lands; to topographical conditions; to the run-off of storm water; to public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
B. Where such is not shown on a Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
1. Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in surrounding areas; or

All rights reserved.
2. Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
C. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
D. If a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed limited access highway, arterial street or railroad right of way, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with access control provisions along the rear property line and screening, deep lots with rear service alleys or such other design as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
E. Reserve strips controlling access of streets shall be prohibited except where their control is placed with the applicable Governing Body under acceptable conditions.
F. Street right of way requirements for other than arterials shall be determined by the total aggregate needs for the functional components for the particular system being considered. The total aggregates shall be in increments of even feet, even numbers only. The components involved shall be as follows depending upon the urban or rural type of characteristics of the street needed based on land use, traffic and density:
1. Moving or traffic lanes may be variable from nine to 12 feet depending on function, e.g., low density residential, cul-de-sac residential, collector, industrial, etc., and on design speed of the roadway. A moving lane may utilize a portion of the surface of certain types of curb construction.
2. Parking lanes for on-street storage of vehicles shall be at least eight feet in width. For computation purposes, up to two feet for curb or shoulder may be included as part of the parking lane.
3. A curb and gutter shall be considered to require two feet irrespective of construction type.
4. Shoulders for rural type roadways shall be not less than three feet in width.
5. Parking strips for streets shall be at least 14 1/2 feet in width from the back of curb to the right of way line. This area shall be used for the installation of utilities, street signs, street lights, traffic control devices, fire hydrants, sidewalks, driveways, street furniture, street trees from an approved City list and to provide a transition area in grades, if necessary, between the roadway and the property adjacent to the right of way. Ditches and border strips for rural type roads shall be variable in width based on drainage, utility installations and other needs.

borders.)
─────────────────
***Includes three-foot shoulder on each side.
These widths may be modified by the Planning Commission on a showing that special conditions exist such as drainage and utility requirements, safe and efficient traffic and pedestrian movement, intersection design, etc. In applying these standards, workable street systems must be established. When a pattern of widths based on function for a given area has been established, the pattern shall be followed until another system can be established or ties into a collector or arterial system. Access control and acceleration and deceleration lanes may be required to properly handle traffic flow and to protect the carrying capacity of the street.
─────────────────
*Note: For arterial standards, see Sections 6-107G and H.

All rights reserved.
G. Arterial right of way widths shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan and where not shown thereon shall be between 80-100 feet with 120 feet needed for special storm water drainage purposes. Arterial roadway widths may vary from 24 to 52 feet.
H. For streets and roadways on the Functional Classification System of the County, prevailing design standards shall apply.
I. Wherever possible, there shall be an inside tangent at least 100 feet in length introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
J. Streets shall be laid out so as to provide for horizontal sight distances on all curves depending upon design speed. These distances shall be:
Arterial Streets: 500 feet
Collector Streets: 300 feet
Local Streets: 200 feet
The sight distance shall be measured within street rights of way from a height of four and one-half feet above the proposed pavement surface in the right hand lane of the roadway.
K. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 80 degrees.
L. Street jogs are to be avoided on arterial and collector streets. On local streets, center line offsets of less than 150 feet should be avoided.
M. Roadway grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves:
Roadway Type Percent Grade
Arterial 3%
Collector 4%
Local 5%
Marginal Access 5%
N. No roadway grade shall be less than 0.32 of one percent, unless approved by the applicable engineer. Greater percentages of grade may be required where necessary to provide adequate drainage.

O. Roadway pavement at intersections shall be rounded by the following minimum radii:
Minimum
Type of Roadway Intersection Width Curb Radii
Local Residential Local Residential 20 feet
Local Residential Collector 30 feet
Local Residential Arterial 30 feet
Commercial/Industrial Commercial/Industrial
Collector or Arterial Collector or Arterial 50 feet
P. Half-streets shall be avoided, except for arterial streets and collector streets where applicable, or where they are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; or, when the Planning Commission finds that it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half-street, or portion thereof, exists and is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. No construction of the roadway shall occur until the full right of way is provided.
Q. The length of cul-de-sacs and the dimensions of the turnaround shall be determined as follows:
1. Cul-de-sacs in single-family areas should not generally be longer than seven times the average lot width or 500 feet, whichever is less. In multiple-family residential areas, such streets shall not exceed 300 feet.
2. In urban type subdivisions, they shall have a turn diameter of at least 70 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet, or shall have a turnaround area such as hammerheads, etc., as providing service equal to the foregoing requirement when an alternative design is warranted by the particular design features of the subdivision.
3. For rural type subdivisions, a minimum street property line diameter of 120 feet or more may be required for fire protection and other equipment.
R. Subdividers are encouraged to consider projects designed to maximize solar access when not in conflict with existing contours or drainage. When the long axis of individual structures is parallel to the street, streets should be oriented as nearly as possible in an east/west direction. If the long axis of structures is perpendicular to the street, north/south street orientation is preferable for solar access purposes.

108 Alleys.
A. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial areas, except that the Planning Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking spaces consistent and adequate for the uses proposed. Alleys in residential districts are to be discouraged.
B. When provided, the minimum right of way of an alley shall be 20 feet.
C. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, a turning radius shall be provided to permit safe vehicular movement.
D. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end.
109 Blocks and Pedestrian Ways.
A. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
1. Provision of adequate building sites suitable for the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
2. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions, off-street parking and loading, etc.
3. Need for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic.
4. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
B. A block should not exceed 1,340 feet in length, unless the previous layout or topographic conditions justify a modification. In general, blocks shall not be less than 400 feet unless necessary because of existing street patterns.
C. All blocks shall be so designed so as to provide two tiers of lots, unless a different arrangement is required in order to comply with or be permitted by other sections of these regulations.
D. Blocks may be irregular in shape, provided they are harmonious with the overall pattern of blocks in the proposed subdivision.
E. In extra long blocks, a public pedestrian way may be required to provide access to public or private facilities such as schools or parks. (See Section 2-102 for definition of PEDESTRIAN WAY [CROSSWALK].)

All rights reserved.
110 Lots.
A. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building setback lines, if any desired, shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of urban and rural development and use contemplated. (See Section 6-106 for flag lots.)
B. Lot dimensions shall conform to the minimum requirements of applicable City or County zoning regulations and County sanitary code, unless higher standards are established in accordance with this subsection:
1. All subdivisions in the City shall be connected to public water supply and sewage disposal systems as well as subdivisions in the surrounding jurisdiction wherever the latter is deemed feasible by the Governing Body.*
2. If the proposed subdivision is serviced with a public water supply, but intends to use a septic tank and tile field for a sewage disposal system, the minimum lot size requirement shall be acres ( square feet) in the unincorporated area only.**
3. If the proposed subdivision in the unincorporated area is serviced by neither a public water supply or a public sewage disposal system and intends to usean on-lot well for water supply and a septic tank system for sewage disposal, the minimum lot size requirement shall be acres ( square feet).**
4. Notwithstanding the provisions of these regulations in Sections 6-110B2 and 3, it is the intent of these regulations to encourage the installation of public water supplies and public sewage disposal systems wherever feasible. In order to determine such feasibility, the Planning Commission may require the subdivider to provide certain basic engineering data and cost estimates on which to base such a decision. Furthermore, if on-lot water supply and sewage disposal installations are used, additional lot area may be required if the area to be subdivided has a high water table, is periodically flooded with water or if the soil conditions prove to be unsuitable based on percolation tests which may be required of the subdivider. If a lagoon system is used for sewage disposal, the lot size must be a minimum of five acres, the lagoon fenced and the edge of the lagoon not less than 300 feet from any existing off-premises dwelling or 100 feet from the nearest property line.**
────────────────────────
*NOTE: All public sanitary sewer systems and sewage treatment plants are further subject to the regulations of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
**NOTE: In calculating the size of the zoning lot, the land in an adjacent right of way may not be included if it is part of the legal description of the lot.

All rights reserved.
C. In those areas where there may be municipal-type water and/or sanitary sewer facilities anticipated in the foreseeable future, but which are not yet available, the Planning Commission may require that lots be so designed and arranged that they may readily be converted to urban type building sites without replatting. When such a condition prevails, land should be subdivided into lots so that by combining lots, a building site is created initially with an area of not less than that required for on-lot wells and/or sewage treatment systems. The creation of such a building site through use of multiple groups of lots shall be contingent upon the establishment for record of restrictive covenants satisfactory to the legal counsel of the Planning Commission, providing that no more than one dwelling unit shall be built on such an aggregate group of lots until such time as municipal-type water and sewer service is available.
D. As a general guideline, the maximum depth of all residential lots shall not exceed two and one-half times the width thereof. For all other types of lots, the depth shall not exceed three times the width.
E. Both in the City and unincorporated area, the area of the street right of way shall not be included and calculated in the size of the lot with respect to minimum lot size requirements of these regulations or of any zoning regulations applicable to the property. Lots shall be required to have more than the minimum area dimensions provided for in this section where such greater area or dimensions are required to meet the yard requirements of the zoning regulations.
F. There shall be no double frontage lots for individual dwellings (e.g., single and two-family units), except where the lots abut upon a limited access highway or arterial street or where the topography of the land prevents reasonable subdivision in small units. Double frontage lots shall not have vehicular access between such lots and an abutting limited access highway or arterial street.
G. Reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except where such are essential to provide a separation of residential development from limited access highways and arterial streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
H. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width, if necessary, to permit appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
I. Side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the street line or substantially so.

All rights reserved.
111 Easements.
A. Utility easements shall be provided where necessary and centered on rear or side lot lines. Such easements shall be at least 20 feet wide along rear lot lines and 10 feet wide along side lot lines, except that easements for street lighting purposes shall not in any event be required to exceed 10 feet. Side lot easements, when needed for other than street lighting purposes such as drainage, may exceed 10 feet.
B. Drainage Easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or channel or a detention pond is constructed, then a storm water easement or drainage right of way shall be provided. Such easement or right of way shall conform substantially to the lines of such watercourse and location of a detention pond and shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary to assure adequate storm water drainage and for access for maintenance thereof. All drainage easements shall be vegetated with perennial grasses or otherwise stabilized to prevent soil erosion and sediment movement by wind or water. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. (See Section 2-102 for definition of DETENTION POND.)
In rural type subdivisions, a triangular drainage and utility easement may be required at the corners of intersecting street rights of way. Where street rights of way intersect at 90 degrees, the limit of such easement would be defined by a line drawn between two points located on the right of way lines which are 25 feet back in each direction from the corner.
C. Vision triangle easements may be required on any corner lot to provide an open and usable vision path for drivers of vehicles approaching the intersection. The extent of vision triangle easements shall be based on the type of intersection (3-way, four, protected, unprotected, etc.); the type of street (local, collector, arterial, commercial or industrial); topography; proposed street grades (if any); and the design speeds contemplated for such roadways. (See Section 2-102 for definition of VISION TRIANGLE.)
D. Wherever a lot or group of lots side or back on to an existing high pressure oil or gas transmission line, a building setback easement shall be established on each side of such line to the minimum safe standards as provided by the applicable oil or gas company to the subdivider or to such standards as may be adopted by the City, state or federal governments, whichever provides the most setback distance. The easement shall be provided on that part of the lot which abuts the oil or gas line and no principal buildings or structures shall be located or constructed within such an easement. Because of the many variables inherit in the establishment of such a setback easement, the City assumes no liability in such a determination.
E. A screening easement may be required to provide for fencing and/or an adequate area for the mature growth of landscaping with appropriate maintenance. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SCREENING.)

112 Commercial and Industrial Subdivisions.
A. Streets. Notwithstanding the other provisions of these regulations, the minimum width of streets adjacent to areas designed, proposed or zoned for commercial or industrial use may be increased by the Planning Commission to such extent as may be deemed necessary to assure the free flow of through traffic without interference from parked or parking motor vehicles.
B. Blocks and lots intended for commercial or industrial use shall be designed specifically for such purpose with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading.
C. Marginal Access Street. When lots or blocks in a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision front on any limited access highway or arterial street, the subdivider may be required to dedicate and improve a marginal access street to provide ingress and egress to and from such lots or blocks.

ARTICLE 7. INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
100 Subdivision Types. For the purposes of these regulations, subdivisions shall be classified as follows:
A. Urban Type Subdivisions.
1. All subdivisions located wholly within the corporate limits of the City.
2. All subdivisions located partially within, adjoining or touching the corporate limits of the City.
3. All subdivisions adjoining or touching the boundary of a tract of land for which annexation proceedings have commenced by the City or the owner has a pending request to be annexed.
4. All subdivisions adjoining or touching another subdivision which has previously received final plat approval by the City and adjoins or touches the corporate limits of the City.
5. All subdivisions which have or intend to have both municipal type water supply and sewage disposal systems, or are subdividing all or portions of the subdivision for commercial or industrial purposes, or for public or semi-public purposes which are directly related to an urban type residential subdivision. (Note: Service by a rural water district could be considered a "municipal type" if the particular size of pipes in that location permitted adequate quantity and pressure commensurate with urban needs.)
B. Rural Type Subdivisions. All other subdivisions required to be platted by these regulations not otherwise classified as the urban type as described in Section 7-100A.
101 Engineering and Governmental Jurisdiction. In setting certain standards and specifications, approving engineering drawings, inspecting improvements, recommending acceptance of improvements, preparing petition forms and establishing the amount of surety for guaranteeing the installation of such improvements; the engineer designated by the City, the County Engineer, or utility provider representative shall be designated as responsible for the improvements within their respective jurisdictions. The term "applicable" Governing Body may mean either the City Commission for urban type subdivisions in the City, or the township trustees or County Board of Commissioners for urban and rural type subdivisions in the unincorporated area. "The” Governing Body refers to the City only. Coordination to achieve cooperation among the governing bodies is the responsibility of the City and, in particular, the Subdivision Administrator.

All rights reserved.
102 Required Improvements. As a condition to final plat acceptance, the subdivider of a proposed subdivision shall be responsible to install or, in cooperation with governmental bodies and utility companies, cause to be installed the following necessary facilities and improvements as listed below. The design and installation of such facilities and improvements shall include such sizing of pipes and extensions of streets as may be deemed desirable within the subdivision to facilitate development of adjacent land. All requirements are applicable to both urban and rural- type subdivisions as defined in Section 7-100 unless specifically described otherwise.
A. All streets, alleys, curbs, gutters and street drainage facilities in urban type subdivisions shall be constructed in accordance with established City standards. All urban type streets shall be constructed of concrete, asphalt or asphaltic concrete and no gravel or sanded roadways shall be constructed. All roadways in rural type subdivisions shall be constructed in accordance with standards established by the County Engineer with gravel or sanded surface and no other materials such as oiled surface, macadam or similar materials shall be used. If other than gravel or sanded surface materials are particularly required, urban construction standards as described above shall apply. To accommodate any future improvements in both urban and rural areas, the entire right of way of collector and local streets and roadways shall be graded to match the level of the road surface. All stumps, trees that cannot be saved, boulders and similar items shall be removed from such right of way. In the unincorporated area, streets and roadways are subject to final acceptance by the applicable township trustees or the County.
B. A storm drainage system shall be provided, separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system, meeting all of the specifications and requirements of the City in urban type subdivisions or the County Engineer in rural types. Such storm drainage system shall be connected to any existing storm sewer system, where available, or if such connection is not available, other adequate means for the discharge of such storm water including the use of detention ponds shall be pro-vided by the subdivider into the nearest major water channel. If it is determined that adequate drainage can be accomplished by a natural drainage way across private property, a drainage easement may be required; however, any initial channelization is the responsibility of the subdivider and continued maintenance the responsibility of the adjacent property owner(s). *
C. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City in urban type subdivisions under the following conditions: (Also, see Section 6-109E for pedestrian ways.)
1. Sidewalks may be required on one or both sides of the street when needed to service pedestrian traffic flow leading to schools, parks, shopping areas or places of public assembly and where heavy traffic would warrant sidewalks for safety purposes. Sidewalks may also be required in residential areas where the lot frontage is less than 150 feet. Sidewalks shall be required to extend or complete connecting links in the sidewalk system.
* Note: When required by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, non-point source storm water permit applications must be filed before construction begins under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (N.P.D.E.S.).

All rights reserved.
2. In general, sidewalks shall be constructed with the inside edge of the sidewalk one foot outside the property line, except in the central business district.
3. All sidewalks shall provide handicap access in conformity with K.S.A. 58-1301 et seq. and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 USCA 12101, as may be amended.
D. Street signs shall be installed in accordance with specifications set by the applicable Governing Body subject to the standards of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices as adopted by the Secretary of the Kansas Department of Transportation and endorsed by the Federal Highway Administrator. (See K.S.A. 8-2003 for sign manual.)
E. Wherever a municipal-type water supply system or its equivalent is required to be constructed by these regulations, such construction shall be in accordance with the standards and requirements set by the applicable agency supplying the water. In all other areas, a water supply shall be provided which meets the standards of the County sanitary code. In those areas where there is a municipal type water supply system, mains shall be of such size as to support the use of fire hydrants as required by Section 7-102F.
F. Fire hydrants of the type and quality specified by City standards, but not less than the minimum standards of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), shall be provided wherever there shall be constructed a municipal type water supply system. Such hydrants shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the applicable Fire Chief.
G. Sanitary Sewer Systems.
1. Wherever sanitary sewers are to be installed as required by these regulations, such sewers are to be constructed in accordance with standards set by the City subject to the regulations of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
2. Wherever septic tank systems or wastewater lagoons are to be used for sewage disposal on individual lots, the determination of the suitability of the lot(s) and the standards for installation and inspection of such facilities shall be governed by the County sanitary code.
H. Underground wiring in residential subdivisions, unless found to be unfeasible, is required for electric power, street lights and telephone service in urban type subdivision, except:
1. For lines rated over 12,000 volts;
2. Appurtenance serving such lines which may be mounted on the ground, such as transformers, transformer pads, telephone service pedestals and street light poles; or

All rights reserved.
3. For those proposed subdivisions or replats of existing subdivisions located in areas which presently have an overhead type utility distribution system.
All such installation shall be under contract with the applicable utility provider. Cable television, if installed, shall be placed underground in accordance with the above requirements. Where telephone, electric, street lights and gas lines are placed underground entirely throughout a subdivision, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services. Further, all transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring underground installation of lines beyond the boundaries of the area contained in the preliminary plat.
All utility lines for telephone and electric service, when carried on overhead poles in other than the above urban type subdivision, shall be placed in rear lot line easements or designated side lot line easements.
I. If screening of public or private areas is to be required, a screening plan of landscaping and/or fencing shall be prepared and approved by the Planning Commission and such screening installed. (See Section 2-102 for definition of SCREENING.)
J. Monuments as shown on the final plat shall be placed at all central points such as block corners, angle points, points of curves in streets and as may be required by the applicable engineer. Monuments shall be made of iron pipes or solid steel rods, e.g., rebars which are not less than one-half inch in outside diameter and not less than 24 inches in length and affixed with a plastic or metal cap which identifies the registration number of the surveyor in responsible charge. All monuments shall be securely placed and set in such a manner that the top of the monument shall be at grade ground level. If cultivation of the land for farming purposes is anticipated, monuments may be lowered nine inches below grade ground level. Bench marks may also be required of such material, size and length as may be approved by the applicable engineer. (See Section 2-102 for definitions of BENCH MARK and MONUMENT and Sections 5-101 D and E for monuments and bench mark(s) to be shown on the final plat.)
K. Whenever existing sanitary or storm water sewers, water lines, drainage channels, culverts, underground or overhead electric and communication lines, gas lines, pipe lines, transmission lines are required to be relocated due to the subdivision or construction of improvements required as a condition of approval of the subdivision and in the event such was not known at the time of subdivision approval for any reason, the costs of such relocation shall be the sole responsibility of the subdivider.
L. Where required, applicable measures will be taken during construction to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation by wind or water. Conservation standards shall be adhered to which have been adopted by the County Conservation District.

103 Exceptions for Existing Improvements.
A. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently having any or all required improvements as set out in Section 7-102 and where such improvements meet the requirements of said section and are in good condition as determined by the applicable Governing Body, no further provision need be made by the subdivider to duplicate such improvements. Where such existing improve-ments, however, do not meet the requirements, the subdivider shall provide for the repair, correction or replacement of such improvements so that all improvements will then meet the aforesaid requirements.
B. Where the proposed subdivision is a resubdivision or concerns an area presently abutting or containing any existing public street of less than the minimum required right of way width or roadway width, land shall be dedicated in so far as is possible so as to provide for a minimum street right of way width and an additional roadway pavement meeting the minimum standards as set by these regulations. The appli-cable Governing Body shall determine what adjustment to make where the aforesaid widenings merge with existing streets which are of smaller width at the boundary of such proposed subdivision. The minimum right of way and roadway width required by these regulations may be reduced to match an existing roadway system if the extension of such roadway is already improved at each end of the roadway in the subdivision.
104 Agreement and Guarantees for Installation of Required Improvements. Except for monuments, one of the following methods shall be used by the subdivider to guarantee that improvements required by these regulations can or will be installed in accordance with approved plans and specifications. This does not preclude the possibility that the applicable Governing Body may, at its discretion and in recognition of its financial position, share in the cost of improvements, especially oversized improvements which may benefit other related areas or the municipality-at-large: (See Section 2-102 for definition of HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION.)
A. Fiscal sureties may be offered and the following shall apply: (See Section 2-102 for definition of DEVELOPER’S AGREEMENT.)
1. The subdivider shall enter into a "Developer’s Agreement" with the applicable Governing Body under which the subdivider agrees to install such required improvements. Such agreement shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the final plat by the applicable Governing Body and filed with the applicable Clerk.
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015. 7-6
All rights reserved.
2. Simultaneously with the execution of the Developer’s Agreement provided for in Section 7-104A1, the subdivider shall furnish a corporate completion bond by a firm authorized to do business in Kansas with good and sufficient sureties thereon or a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the applicable Governing Body, in the amount of the estimated cost as approved by the official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the installa-tion of the required improvements. Such financial guarantee shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the final plat and further conditioned upon the actual completion and satisfactory installation of such required improvements within two years from the date that the final plat is accepted by the Governing Body.
3. Simultaneously with the execution of the Developer’s Agreement provided for in Section 7-104A1, if the subdivider furnishes a corporate completion bond, he or she shall also deposit in escrow with the applicable Governing Body cash in the amount of 15% of the cost of all improvements to be made in accordance with the plans and specifications for required improvements or an equivalent amount in the form of a maintenance bond or other securities that may be deemed sufficient by the applicable Governing Body. If a subdivider furnishes a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter of credit, 15% of the amount of such guarantees shall be returned by, or held as a deposit in escrow after, the final completion of such improvements. The subdivider shall agree that such deposit in escrow may be held by the applicable Governing Body for a period of 18 months after such improvements are completed for the purpose of:
a. Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in material or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in character, and not discernible at the time of final inspection or acceptance by the applicable Governing Body; and
b. Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of the settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof.
Such escrow agreement shall provide that, as such defects have so developed, that the deposit may be applied by the applicable Governing Body for any amounts incurred correcting such defects; and that the balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of such 18-month period shall be returned by the applicable Governing Body to the depositor, or paid to the order of the depositor without payment of interest.
B. Petitions to the applicable Governing Body may be submitted as a means of guaranteeing to such Governing Body the authority to install improvements at such time as they deem appropriate. Petitions may be submitted only when the following conditions exist:
1. The petitions must be valid as may be provided for under Kansas law.

All rights reserved.
2. The petitions must be approved by the applicable Governing Body concurrently with the acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the applicable Governing Body concurrently with the petition approval or as soon thereafter as may be provided by law. The cost of the publication of said resolution shall be borne by the subdivider.
4. A certificate signed by the petitioner must be recorded with the County Register of Deeds stating that such petitions have been filed and approved by the applicable Governing Body and that certain land within the plat as described will be liable in the future for special assessment for the required improvements authorized.
C. For streets and related drainage only in rural type subdivisions, preconstruction of improvements as an alternative method of guaranteeing their installation may be used if approved by the County Governing Body. In this event, the subdivider may request such Governing Body to hold the final plat acceptance until such time as an inspection certifies that the required improvements have been properly constructed. Such a preconstruction procedure shall be temporarily conditioned on subsequent acceptance of the final plat and a time limit for actual construction mutually agreed upon. Maintenance guarantees may also be required if deemed desirable. (See Section 7-104A3 for maintenance guarantee methods.)
D. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter from the utility provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have been made by the subdivider guaranteeing the installation of their respective services.
E. Monuments and bench marks shall be installed and their installation certified by a licensed land surveyor on the final plat before such plat is recorded with the County Register of Deeds. (See Section 5-101 Q 1 for Land Surveyor's Certificate.)
105 Off-site Improvements. The applicable Governing Body may, upon making a finding of necessity, require the subdivider to install or upgrade off-site improvements located outside the perimeter of a subdivision if such need is substantially created by a proposed subdivision. Such off-site improvements should be within dedicated rights of way or ease-ments and serve a public purpose. The financing and guaranteeing of such improvements shall be administered as if they were the same as on-site improvements under Section 7-104. The applicable Governing Body may require such subdivision to participate in the following facilities and improvements, or any other off-site improvements as recommended by the Planning Commission, if the need is created by a proposed subdivision:
A. Drainage improvements;
B. Pedestrian ways and sidewalks;
C. Screening;
D. Special grading requirements;
E. Street improvements; or
F. Traffic control devices.

ARTICLE 8. IMPROVEMENT PROCEDURES
100 Submittal of Petitions. If petitions are proposed to meet the requirements of Article 7, the subdivider shall so indicate at the time of submittal of the preliminary plat. If the petition method is authorized by the applicable Governing Body, petitions shall accompany the final plat for approval by such Governing Body.
101 Final Improvement Plans. When the use of petitions has not been requested by the subdivider or authorized by the applicable Governing Body and a letter(s) of satisfactory arrangements from a utility provider(s) are not being utilized to guarantee improvements (See Section 7-104D for letter from utility), the subdivider shall have prepared by an engineer (which may be contracted for privately or with any governmental agency or utility), engineering drawings for proposed required improvements containing the data and information specified in Section 8-101A. Such drawings shall be certified by a licensed engineer and shall be submitted to the applicable reviewing official in duplicate at least 20 days prior to the date that approval is requested.
A. Content. The engineering drawings shall contain the following data plus additional information deemed necessary by the applicable engineer:
1. Plans, details, specifications and cost estimates for roadway, alley and sidewalk construction; including plans, profile indicating existing topography and elevation including curb and sidewalk elevation when required, intersection control elevation and paving geometrics for each street with a typical cross section of the roadway. The profiles of grade lines shall be shown to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet horizontal, and one inch equals 10 feet vertical; or to a scale approved by the applicable engineer. This information shall be shown on standard plan and profile sheets unless otherwise required by such engineer and use topographic information cited in Section 5-100B3.
2. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed storm drainage improvements.
3. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed water distribution system, water supply facilities and fire hydrants.
4. Plans, profiles, details, specifications and cost estimates of proposed sanitary sewage system.
5. All plans for other utilities such as for electric, gas and telephone shall be prepared by or at the direction of the utility providing the service.

All rights reserved.
B. Review. The applicable engineer, official or agency responsible for determining specifications and standards shall review all engineering drawings in order to determine whether such drawings are consistent with the approved final plat and comply with the design standards. If such drawings are consistent and so comply, the reviewing official shall forward to the applicable Governing Body a notice to that effect. In the event that the drawings do not so comply, the reviewing official shall notify the subdivider of the specific manner in which such drawings do not comply, and he or she may then correct such drawings. If such drawings are not corrected, the reviewing official shall forward to such Governing Body a notice as to the items of nonconformity or noncompliance.
102 Construction of Improvements. No improvements shall be constructed nor shall any work preliminary thereto be done, except as provided for under a preconstruction agreement in rural-type subdivisions, until such time as the engineering construction drawings shall have been approved and there shall have been compliance with all of the requirements relating to the Subdivider's Agreement and such guarantees as are specified in Section 7-104 of these regulations.
A. Inspection. All improvements constructed or erected shall be subject to inspection by the applicable engineer or official responsible for setting and enforcing the applicable design and construction standards of the required improvements. The cost attributable to all inspections required by these regulations shall be charged to and paid by the subdivider. In so far as is possible, the subdivider shall give at least 48 hours notification to such official prior to the performance of any inspection work.
B. Inspection Procedures. After notice is received as specified in Section 8-102A above, the applicable engineer or official designated may conduct an on-site inspection to determine that the work complies with the approved engineering plans and specifications. If in the opinion of such engineer or official, the work does not comply with such final drawings, he or she shall have authority to order that all such work shall be terminated until such time as necessary steps are taken to correct any defects or deficiencies. Upon the correction of such defects or defi-ciencies, the subdivider shall again notify the applicable engineer or official as provided in Section 8-102A that the work is again ready for inspection.
C. Final Inspection. Upon completion of all improvements within the area covered by the final plat, the subdivider shall notify the applicable engineer or official designated in Section 8-102A above, who shall thereupon conduct a final inspection of all improvements installed. If such final inspection indicates that there are any defects or deficiencies in such improvements as installed, or if there are any devia-tions in such improvements as installed from the final engineering plans and specifications, he or she shall notify the subdivider in writing and the subdivider shall, at their sole cost and expense, correct such defects or deviations within six months of the date of notification. When such defects, deficiencies or deviations have been corrected, the subdivider shall notify the official that the improvements are again ready for final inspection. After the final inspection is made and before acceptance of the improvement by the applicable Governing Body, the subdivider shall file a statement with the engineer or official which is executed by the

All rights reserved.
subdivider, certifying that all obligations incurred in the construction of the improvement involved have been properly paid and settled.
103 Acceptance of Improvements. If a final inspection indicates that all improvements as installed contain no unacceptable defects, deficiencies or deviations, within 15 days from the submission of the subdivider's statement of obligation paid, the applicable engineer or official designated shall certify to the applicable Governing Body and utility provider(s) that all improvements have been installed in conformity with the engineering plans and specifications accompanying the final plat. Upon the receipt by the applicable Governing Body of such notification and in conformity with the requirements of these regulations and all other applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations, such Governing Body shall thereupon by resolution or utility by letter formally accept such improvements. The improvements shall become the property of such Governing Body or utility provider involved. Prior to this final action, however, neither the acceptance of the final plat, any subsequent annexation to the City or irrespective of any act(s) of employees, such actions shall not constitute their formal acceptance of improvements.

ARTICLE 9. PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF LOT SPLITS
100 Application Procedure. The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to approve or disapprove lot splits. An application with the required fee for a lot split approval shall be submitted to the Subdivision Administrator by the owner of the land at least 20 days prior to the next regular meeting of the Planning Commission. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) Four copies of a drawing to scale of the lots involved if there are no structures on the lot shall accompany the application or four copies of a survey if there are structures on the lot showing the precise location of structures thereon. Each drawing or survey shall show the location, dimensions and legal description of the proposed split; the square footage contained in each portion of the original lot; all existing easements including public reservations such as building setback lines or access control and a certificate of approval as worded in Section 9-101C. (See Section 2-102 for definition of LOT SPLIT.)
Written notices shall be distributed by the Administrator to all owners of land adjacent to the property proposed to be split including such owners across the street or other public way. The application for a lot split must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all persons to receive notices. Such owners shall have 10 days from the date of mailing the notification to inform the Administrator of any protest or concerns they may have on the lot split. The 10 day waiting period may be waived upon presentation of a written statement of no objection from those to be notified.
101 Approval Guidelines. Approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be made based on the following guidelines:
A. A lot split shall not be approved unless all of the following requirements have or can be satisfied:
1. A new street or alley or extension of an existing street or alley is required or proposed.
2. A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required and has not been satisfied.
3. Such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g., utilities, drainage, sidewalks, traffic control, streets, etc. or will interfere with maintaining existing service levels, e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.
4. There is less street right of way than required by these regulations or the Comprehensive Plan unless such dedication can be made by separate instrument.
5. All easement requirements have not been satisfied.
6. Such split will result in a lot without direct access from its frontage to an opened public street. (See Section 6-106 for Access.)
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015. 9-2
All rights reserved.
7. A substandard sized lot will be created or an existing structure will not be able to meet all yard requirements according to applicable zoning regulations or sanitary code.
8. The lot is subject to periodic flooding which cannot be feasibly corrected in order to properly develop the lot.
9. The lot has been previously split without replatting.
B. The Planning Commission may make such additional requirements as deemed necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of existing land development regulations and applicable Governing Body policy. Requirements may include, but not be limited to, the installation of public facilities, water supply and sewage disposal and/or the dedication of right of way and easements.
C. The Planning Commission shall, in writing, either approve with or without conditions or disapprove the lot split within 45 days of application. If approved, and after all conditions have been met, the Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall sign the following certificate of approval as required on the lot split drawing or survey. Acknowledgement of the certificate may be made by a notary public or by the County Clerk, Register of Deeds, Mayor or Clerk. (See K.S.A. 58-2211, as amended.)

ARTICLE 10. VACATIONS AND CORRECTIONS
100 Vacation of Unrecorded Plat.
A. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Planning Commission, a preliminary or final plat may be withdrawn from consideration either before or after approval by the Commission. Upon approval of the request by a motion of the Commission, the Subdivision Administrator is automatically directed to remove the case file from the City records.
B. Upon written request of the subdivider to the Clerk, a final plat for which dedications, if any, have been accepted by the applicable Governing Body may be vacated by motion of such Governing Body; provided, that (1) the plat has not been recorded; (2) no lots have been sold or transferred; and (3) no improvements have been installed. After the plat is vacated, the Administrator shall see that all fiscal sureties are returned to the subdivider except for those expenditures which have been incurred by the City or County in administrative, legal or engineering costs prior to the date of the request for vacation. Upon the return of such sureties, the Administrator is automatically directed to remove the case file including any petitions from the City records.
C. Upon determining from the County Register of Deeds that a final plat has not been recorded within 60 days from its final acceptance by the Governing Body or within 15 days after a final acceptance by the County Governing Body under the preconstruction procedures of Section 7-104C, the Administrator shall notify the subdivider that the plat is null and void and that the case file will be removed from the City records within 30 days unless a reapplication for platting is received during that time. (See Section 4-112 for Recording of Final Plat.)
101 Vacation of Recorded Plat.
A. (Inside the City or in the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area.) Recorded plats may be vacated by either replatting according to Section 10-101A1 below or directly vacated according to Section 10-101A2:
1. According to K.S.A. 12-512b, any recorded plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public reservation, including, without limitation, easements, dedicated building setback lines and access control, whether established by instrument, condemnation or earlier plats, shall be vacated both as to use and as to title without any further proceedings upon the filing and recording with the County Register of Deeds in accordance with K.S.A. 12-403, any plat or replat duly executed in accordance with these regulations which embraces the same lands as those heretofore embraced by the earlier plat or part thereof or street, alley or other public reservation. Streets, alleys or other public reservations which may be vacated shall revert, as provided for in K.S.A. 12-506, to abutting property owners according to their frontage thereon; provided, that such land to be reverted was derived directly or indirectly from the owner of the land from which such street, alley or public

All rights reserved.
reservation was originally platted. The proper completion of the Owner's Certificate and Dedication as required by Section 5-101 Q 2 shall constitute appropriate notice to all persons having property rights or interests affected by the above platting or replatting.
2. Recorded plats may also be vacated without replatting. The procedure is the same as provided for in Section 10-103.
102 Correction of Platting Errors.
A. According to K.S.A. 12-420, procedures are provided to correct certain platting errors. If, after recording a final plat, an error is found in distances, angles, bearings, subdivision or street names, block or lot numbers, the computation of dimension or elevation or other details of the plat, except in connection with the outer boundaries of the plat, and if the property described in that part of the plat containing the error is under the ownership of the person who caused the plat to be prepared, the applicable City or County Engineer, after substantiation of the existence of the error, may file an affidavit with the County Register of Deeds that the error was made. The affidavit shall describe the nature and extent of the error and the appropriate correction. The Register of Deeds shall record the affidavit and shall place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation that the affidavit has been filed, the date of filing and the book and page where it is recorded. The filing of the affidavit shall correct any such errors, but shall have no effect on the validity of the plat or any property interest recorded by reference thereto. A copy of the recorded affidavit shall be filed with the Subdivision Administrator. The County will bill the person requesting the correction for engineering costs and recording fees.
103 Vacation of Streets, Alleys, Easements and Plats.
A. (Inside the City only.) According to K.S.A. 12-504 and 505, the following procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys or other public reservations such as, but not limited to public easements, dedicated building setback lines, access control, or a part thereof, and including all or parts of recorded plats:*
1. Petitions for vacations received from the Governing Body, the owner of platted land or the owner of land adjoining on both sides of any street, alley, easement or other public reservation may be filed with the Clerk and transmitted to the Subdivision Administrator for processing. All may nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for Fees.) The Planning Commission shall give public notice of a hearing on a proposed vacation by publication once in the official city newspaper by the Subdivision Administrator. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for such hearing. Such notice shall state (1) the nature of the vacation petition, (2) the legal
*Note: The same statutory procedure may be used to exclude a portion of land from the boundaries of the City, i.e., the land could also be "deannexed".

All rights reserved.
description of the property and (3) the date, time and place for the hearing before the Planning Commission. The notice may contain the information that the hearing may be adjourned from time to time upon a motion to continue in the future at some stated date, time and place. Furthermore, the Commission by rule shall mail a notice to all affected utility providers; all owners of land proposed for vacation; all landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open; and owners on the opposite side of the street from vacations of setbacks and access control. The petitioner(s) shall provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator, including names, addresses and zip codes. Such notice to providers and landowners shall be mailed so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the mailing date and the hearing date.
2. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the vacation should be approved or disapproved and with or without conditions attached. At the hearing, the Planning Commission shall hear such testimony as may be presented or as may be required in order to fully understand the true nature of the petition and the propriety of recommending the same. If the Planning Commission determines from the testimony presented that:
a. due and legal notice has been given;
b. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
c. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
d. in justice to the petitioner(s) the vacation should be granted;
then, the Planning Commission shall recommend that such vacation be approved and entered at length in the minutes. Such recommendation may provide for the reservation to the City and/or the owners of any lesser prop-erty rights for public utilities, rights of way and easements for public service facilities originally located in such vacated land or planned for the future. The recommendation may be conditioned upon the petitioner's responsibility to remove or relocate all underground or surface utilities or paving in or on the vacated land. The petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk, at or before the hearing, by any owner who would be a proper party to the petition, but has not joined therein. Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written objection is filed with the Clerk by any owner of lands which adjoin the portion to be vacated. The recommendation of the Planning Commission to the Governing Body shall be made in the same manner as provided by K.S.A. 12-752 for the submission and approval of a final plat. (See Sections 4-107 and 108 for the 60-day time period for consideration of a plat and Section 4-110 for Governing Body approval procedure.) The Planning Commission
© Foster & Associates, Planning Consultants, 2015. 10-4
All rights reserved.
shall announce at their hearing when the Governing Body will consider the recommendation on the vacation.
Following the approval of the vacation by the Governing Body in the form of an order, the Clerk shall certify a copy of the order to the County Register of Deeds; however, such certification shall be withheld until such time as any conditions attached to the order have been satisfied. The Register of Deeds shall note on the recorded plat of the "townsite," i.e., the City, or the applicable platted addition, the words, "canceled by order" or "canceled in part by order" and give the book and page where recorded.
B. (In the extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction area only.)
According to K.S.A. 58-2613 through 2615, the following procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys, public easements or public reservations, e.g., building setback lines and access control, and including all or parts of recorded plats:
1. The owners of any platted land proposed for vacation or the adjoining owners on both sides of any street, alley, public easement or public reservation, or part thereof, may file a petition to vacate with the Board of County Commissioners. Upon such filing, the County Commissioners shall fix a date, time and place for a hearing and publish a notice in the official county newspaper. At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of such publication and the date set for the hearing. State statutes also require that notice of the hearing be given to the City Governing Body and the Planning Commission.
If the Commissioners are satisfied at the hearing that:
a. proper notice has been given;
b. the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience; and
c. no private rights will be injured or endangered;
then the Commissioners shall order such vacation be made and entered in the minutes of the proceedings. Such order shall protect and provide for the property rights of public utilities, rights of way and easements for public service facilities in existence and use. No such vacation shall be granted; however, if the City Governing Body protests against such vacation. Furthermore, when only a portion of a street, alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be granted if a written objection is filed with the County Clerk by any owner of land which adjoins the portion to be vacated. The Clerk shall record a certified copy of the order with the County Register of Deeds. The petitioner shall pay the Clerk any cost of the proceedings including publication and recording costs.

All rights reserved.
2. Prior to the above hearing by the Board of County Commissioners, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider a recommendation to the Governing Body as to whether the vacation should be recommended for approval by the County Commissioners with or without conditions attached or protested against. The Commission by rule shall mail a notice 10 days before the hearing to all affected utility providers; all owners of land proposed for vacation; all landowners abutting a street, alley or easement including any segment remaining open; owners on the opposite side of the street from vacations of setbacks and access control; and the County Engineer. The petitioner(s) shall provide a list of such landowners as required by the Subdivision Administrator, including names, addresses and zip codes. All nongovernmental petitioners will be billed a processing fee. (See Section 3-109 for fees.) The Planning Commission shall announce at their hearing when the Governing Body will consider the vacation and the date, time and place of the County Commissioners' hearing. Unless the Governing Body deems it desirable to protest the vacation, a resolution shall be adopted to recommend the vacation to the County Commissioners which may or may not be subject to conditions. If conditions are required, the City Clerk may refrain from certifying the resolution until such time as the conditions are satisfied. After certification, the City Clerk will provide the petitioner with a copy of the resolution to be submitted to the County Commissioners.
3. In the event that the County has designated their planning board to hold the public hearing on the vacation, the certified resolution should be submitted for their hearing.

ARTICLE 11. APPEALS, WAIVERS AND MODIFICATIONS
100 Appeals General. The subdivider of a proposed subdivision may appeal decisions made in the enforcement of these regulations by the Subdivision Administrator to the Planning Commission and by the Planning Commission to the Governing Body. In the event the Governing Body sustains the Planning Commission, the action of the Planning Commission shall be final except as otherwise provided by law. If the Governing Body overrules the Planning Commission, the Governing Body shall make its decision, in writing or in the minutes of the meeting, stating the reason therefore and return such decision and plat to the Planning Commission for consideration of reapproval.
101 Appeals on Improvement Standards. Any appeal as to approval of standards or plans and engineering drawings in connection with required improvements shall be directed to the applicable Governing Body and that action shall be final.
102 Waiver of Required Improvements or Guarantees for Installation of Same. Any waiver of the required improvements or guarantees for their installation may be made only by the applicable Governing Body on a showing that such improvements are not technically feasible or necessary.
103 Modifications. In cases in which there is unwarranted hardship in carrying out the literal provisions of these regulations as to design standards, the Commission may grant a modification from such provision according to the following guidelines: (See Article 6, Design Standards.)
A. A request for a modification shall be made to the Subdivision Administrator who shall transmit it to the Planning Commission. The Commission shall give the subdivider and any other interested person an opportunity to be heard with respect to the requested modification.
B. The Planning Commission shall not grant a modification unless it shall find that (1) the strict application of these regulations will create an unwarranted hardship; (2) modification is in harmony with the general spirit and intended purpose of these regulations; (3) the rights of adjacent property owners will not adversely be affected; and (4) the public safety, health and general welfare will be protected.
C. When used in this Section, the term "unwarranted hardship" shall mean the effective deprivation of use as distinguished from a mere inconvenience.
D. Modifications permitted under the provisions of this Article shall not include modifications from the requirements of improvement standards, required improvements or guaranteeing their installation unless approved by the applicable Governing Body as provided for in Sections 11-101 and 102. Furthermore, variances may not be granted from the provisions of applicable zoning regulations by these modification procedures

ARTICLE 12. AMENDMENTS AND REVIEW
100 Amendment Procedure. These regulations may be amended at any time after the Planning Commission shall have held a public hearing on the proposed amendment. A notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the official city newspaper so that at least 20 days shall elapse between the publication date and the date of such hearing. Such notice shall fix the time and place for the hearing and shall describe such proposed amendment(s) in general terms. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time. At its conclusion, the Commission shall prepare its recommendations and by an affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission adopt the proposed amendments to these regulations and submit them, together with the written summary of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body.
The Governing Body either may: (1) Approve such recommendations by ordinance; (2) override the Planning Commission recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the City Commission; or (3) return the same to the Commission for further consideration, together with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body's failure to approve or disapprove. If the Governing Body returns the Commission's recommendations, the Commission after considering the same, may resubmit their original recommendations giving the reasons therefore or submit new and amended recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the Governing Body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by an ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If the Commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the Governing Body following the Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Governing Body's report, the Governing Body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly. The amended regulations shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance. A copy of such legal publication shall be added to the Appendix of these regulations.
101 Annual Review. In order to maintain these regulations, the Planning Commission shall annually hold a public review at its regular meeting in February to consider amendments, if any, to these regulations. Notification of such a public review may be distributed to governmental agencies and interested parties. If amendments are deemed desirable, the amendment procedure as described in Section 12-100 shall be followed. During the intervening period between reviews, the Subdivision Administrator shall maintain a list of possible amendments which may be periodically brought to his or her attention.
102 Judicial Review. As provided by K.S.A. 12-760, as amended, any ordinance, regulation or decision provided for or authorized by these regulations shall be reasonable and any person aggrieved thereby may have the reasonableness of any decision determined by bringing an action against the City within 30 days after a final decision is made by the City. Such action shall be brought in the Rice County District Court.

If any part or provision of these regulations is adjudged unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, then such part or provision shall be considered separately and apart from the remaining parts or provisions of these regulations, and said part or provision to be completely severable from the remainder of these regulations, and the remainder provisions of these regulations shall remain in full force and effect.
101 Effective Date. These regulations shall be in full force and effect from and after their adoption by the Commission, approval by the Governing Body by an ordinance incorporating these regulations by reference as a Model Code and publication of such ordinance in the official city newspaper.
