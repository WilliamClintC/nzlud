The statute of limitations on a claim for credit or refund shall be two (2) years after the end of the calendar year in which payment or remittance in error was made.

The notice of audit must specify the tax and time period to be audited and must detail the minimum documentation or books and records to be made available to the auditor.  Audits must be held only during reasonable times of the day and, unless impracticable, at times agreed to by the taxpayer.  An auditor who determines that there has been an overpayment of tax during the course of the audit is obligated to identify the overpayment to the taxpayer so that the taxpayer can take the necessary steps to recover the overpayment. If the overpayment is the result of the application of some or all of the taxpayer's tax payment to an incorrect local government entity, the auditor must notify the correct local government entity of the taxpayer's application error.

In no event may a taxpayer be provided a time period less than forty-five (45) days after the date the notice was served in which to protest a notice of tax determination or notice of tax liability. Any notice of tax assessment due must be sent by United States registered or certified mail.

Sec. 8-69.        Installment Contracts.  [back to top]

Sec. 8-70.        Voluntary Disclosure.  [back to top]

A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the date of filing the application.  Except for the amount of tax and interest due under this Section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed, provided, however, that if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due as provided in this Section, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest required under this Section must be made within ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application, except that any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this Section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed.

Sec. 8-71.        Criminal Penalties.  [back to top]

Criminal penalties may not be imposed on taxpayers for noncompliance with the provisions of a locally imposed and administered tax unless the noncompliance is a result of willful or fraudulent disregard of the Village’s tax laws. 

Sec. 8-72.        Review of Liens.  [back to top]

Sec. 8-74.        Application.  [back to top]

Gross charge means the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the Village and for all services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination point within a municipality that has imposed a tax under this Article and charges for the portion of the inter-office channels provided within that municipality.  Charges for that portion of the inter-office channel connecting two or more channel termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional boundary of such municipality, shall be determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the inter-office channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of  channel  termination  points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the municipality and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points connected by the inter-office channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include any of the following:

(A)       Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made pursuant to: (i) the tax imposed by this Article, (ii) the tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act, (iii) the tax imposed by Section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, (iv) 911 surcharges, or (v) charges added to customers' bills pursuant to the provisions of Section 9-221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers' bills by retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those provisions of the Public Utilities Act;

(D)       Charges for customer equipment, including such equipment that is leased or rented by the customer from any source, wherein such charges are disaggregated and separately identified from other charges;

(E)       Charges to business enterprises certified as exempt under Section 9-222.1 of the Public Utilities Act to the extent of such exemption and during the period of time specified by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs;

(F)       Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this Act has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service;

(G)       Bad debts, which means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made;

(H)       Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunication devices;

(I)        Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act;

(J)        Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if (i) those charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are taxable, (ii) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or invoice, and (iii) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on the retailer’s books and records kept in the regular course of business.  If the nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or telecommunications.  The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the retailer of the telecommunications.  (Ord. 06-25)

Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate or terminate outside this State.

Intrastate telecommunications  means all telecommunications that originate and terminate within this State.

Person means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed by order of any court, the Federal and State governments, including State universities created by statute, or any city, town, county, or other political subdivision of this State.

Purchase at retail  means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail.

Retailer means every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this Section. The Department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this State, who, to the satisfaction of the Department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this State in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this State. The permit may be revoked by the Department at its discretion.

Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.

Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the Village and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by the Article.

Telecommunications, in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service, private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this Article, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non­taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this Act. For purposes of this Section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.

Sec. 8-76.   Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Imposed.  [back to top]

A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:

(A)       The act or privilege of originating in the Village or receiving in the Village intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six (6) percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer.  To prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this Section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax.

(B)       The act or privilege of originating in the Village or receiving in the Village interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six (6) percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer.  To prevent actual multistate or multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or municipality in this State on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this Section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax properly due and paid in a municipality in this State which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this State. 

(C)       The tax imposed by this Article is not imposed on such act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the Village.

(A)       The tax authorized by this Article shall be collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this State and shall be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this Article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use in the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this Article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the manner provided by the Department.

(B)       Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this Article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

Sec. 8-78.        Returns to Department.  [back to top]

The tax imposed under this Article on telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required by the Department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (35 ILCS 636/5-1 et seq.) and any accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement this Act.

Sec. 8-79.        Resellers.  [back to top]

(A)       If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this Article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the Department may reasonably require.

(B)       Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person having discontinued the making of resales.

(C)       Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

(E)       The game room license may be suspended, revoked or denied renewal at any time for violation of this Section or of any of the conditions imposed upon the license, but only after the licensee has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard.  The hearing shall be conducted by the Village Manager, who shall then recommend to the Village Board the action which he deems appropriate.

Based on this inspection grade, the schedule of the next annual, semiannual and/or exterior inspection shall be determined, as provided in Section 10-85.2 below. 

(D)       The total number of dwelling units (excluding vacant units defined as a “work in progress” or owner occupied) inspected in the building, plus one (1) for interior common areas and plus one (1) for the exterior common area of the building, including all accessory structures, shall determine the total number of inspection areas used in calculating the annual inspection grade. For those condominium units or townhomes (that do not have maintenance responsibility for the exterior or common interior areas) that are to be inspected, there shall only be one (1) inspection area.  No interior common area or exterior common area issues shall be inspected or graded as part of this program other than balconies, patios, decks, exterior screens and dwelling unit door closers for the unit being inspected.    

(E)       Vacated units may be inspected by the Village as part of the annual or semiannual inspection process. A vacant unit deemed a work in progress shall be exempt from the annual and semiannual inspection process and the grading system for the building, if such unit is in compliance with the requirements for a work in progress. To qualify as a work in progress, the unit shall be identified as either having ongoing remodeling, repair or new construction or proposed to correct a Code violation and shall be vacant and unoccupied. Additionally, the request for such units to be exempted shall be requested in writing by the property owner or his designee and verified both visually and in writing by the inspector. Qualifying units shall be inspected before the unit is occupied and is subject to all fees and reinspections that are otherwise deemed applicable. No such unit may be rented if any safety or health issues are identified through the inspection process. Failure to request and have an inspection approved before allowing the unit to be occupied or furnished (any personal effects) by the tenant is prohibited and is subject to a citation being issued to the property owner, manager or landlord. Failure to complete the work that qualified the unit for the exemption shall be charged a one hundred dollar ($100.00) administrative fee to adjust the results of the inspection and the change of the grade if applicable. Inspections for “work in progress’ shall be scheduled a minimum of seven (7) working days before the use of the unit is anticipated. Vacant units that are approved as a “work in progress” are limited as such for a period not to exceed ninety (90) calendar days.  (Ord. 10-26; 11-17; 14-09).

Sec. 10-85.2. Inspection Grading System.  [back to top]

(A)       Each property required to have a residential rental license shall be given an inspection grade at the conclusion of any annual inspection.  The total number of violations and deficiencies observed at the time of the annual inspection divided by the total number of inspection areas shall determine the inspection grade of the building. A building having two (2) separate entrances, each with a different address, shall be considered two (2) buildings when the interior common area is not continuous throughout the building. If the building has two (2) entrances, each with a separate address with the interior common hallway allowing for passage from one (1) entrance to the other, only one (1) residential rental license shall be issued. 

If there are two (2) licenses, the exterior areas shall be divided accordingly by determining a reasonable center point between each entrance which shall act as a dividing line for the inspection areas. All exterior common areas and accessory structures shall be inspected based on the proximity of the area to each building being inspected and the related uses.  

Exterior areas that extend beyond property lines that are not under direct ownership of the building owners shall be inspected as part of the building’s exterior area by dividing the property in half based on the proximity of the next building.

(B)              Any building having, on average, one (1) or less violations or deficiencies at the completion of an annual inspection shall receive an inspection grade of Very Good. An inspection grade of Very Good exempts the building from the next annual inspection process and the next annual residential rental license fee. However, the application for a new residential rental license shall still be submitted and approved and all reinspections and reinspection fees are still applicable. Should a reinspection be required based on the results of the annual inspection, no reinspection fee shall be assessed for the annual inspection. In addition, no exterior only inspections shall be scheduled during the license year.  These exceptions shall be invalidated if within the twelve (12) months following the initial annual inspection, the respective building or site receives four (4) or more valid service requests (complaints) that have not been corrected within seven (7) calendar days after being notified by the Village or is found guilty of a violation of the housing program regulations.  This exemption shall not be approved if during the annual inspection, there is any violation relating to infestation or there are four (4) or more violations in the common area or if the current rental license fee has not been paid on a timely basis as per Section 10-81 of the Village Code, in which case the building shall be graded as Satisfactory. Beginning with the 2008-2009 license year, by achieving and maintaining a Very Good grade on three (3) consecutive annual inspections and maintaining the associated Waived status, the building shall be exempted from the following two (2) annual inspections and the following two (2) residential rental license fees, if maintained under the same ownership.  Achieving a Very Good on the next annual inspection shall again exempt the building for an additional two (2) years from having any inspections or paying a license fee if maintained under the same ownership.  If a rental license is not properly applied for before the beginning of the license year for the year of the waived status the waived status shall be withdrawn and the site shall be regarded as a Satisfactory, requiring both a license fee and the applicable inspections.

Any building having an average of more than one (1) but not more than three (3) violations or deficiencies per inspection area at the completion of an annual inspection shall receive a grade of Satisfactory. A grade of Satisfactory requires that one (1) exterior only inspection be conducted during the same license year.  A grade of Satisfactory also requires that for the next Village residential rental license year, a residential rental license shall be applied for, paid for and issued and that another annual inspection shall be conducted and all reinspections and reinspection fees shall be applicable. 

Any building having an average of more than three (3) violations or deficiencies per inspection area at the completion of an annual inspection shall receive a grade of Unsatisfactory.  A grade of Unsatisfactory requires that a semiannual inspection be conducted.  This inspection applies to all areas subject to an annual inspection. A grade of Unsatisfactory requires that two (2) exterior only inspections be conducted during the same license year.  In addition, for the next Village residential rental license year, a residential rental license shall be applied for, paid for and issued, another annual inspection shall be conducted, and all reinspections and reinspection fees shall be applicable. (Ord. 15-04)

(C)       Sites receiving a Very Good grade: 

(1)      shall not be charged a reinspection fee for an annual inspection if such an inspection is required; and

(2)        shall not be scheduled for any exterior only inspections.

(D)       Sites receiving a Satisfactory grade:

(1)        shall be charged for the reinspection at fifty dollars ($50.00) per unit where violations exist and/or the building fee if violations exist in interior common areas or the exterior of the building; and

(2)       shall be charged a fee for one (1) exterior only inspection equal to the annual license fee less the per unit charge.

(E)       Sites receiving an Unsatisfactory grade:

(1)        shall be charged for the reinspection at fifty dollars ($50.00) per unit where violations exist and/or the building fee if violations exist in interior common areas or the exterior of the building; and

(2)       shall be charged a fee for one (1) semiannual inspection equal to the annual license fee; and

(3)        shall be charged a fee for two (2) exterior only inspections equal to the annual license fee less the per unit charge for each inspection.

Sec. 10-85.3. Semiannual Inspections.  [back to top]

Semiannual inspections shall be conducted when an annual inspection grade of Unsatisfactory is determined. Semiannual inspections shall require the duplication of the annual inspection process allowing again the random selection of units to inspect. A semiannual inspection shall not reduce the number of exterior only inspections that shall be required. The semiannual inspection fee shall be in the same amount as the annual inspection fee. (Ord. 10-26)

Sec. 10-85.4. Reinspections.  [back to top]

Reinspections shall be conducted on an as-needed basis when a scheduled inspection identifies violations or Code deficiencies. Reinspections may identify additional issues in addition to those already identified.   The fee for each scheduled reinspection shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) per unit where violations exist and/or the building fee if violations exist in interior common areas or the exterior of the building. (Ord. 10-26; 14-09)

Sec. 10-85.5. Exterior Only Inspections.  [back to top]

In addition to the annual rental inspection, each building (excluding single-family residences, townhomes where the property is not directly maintained by the owner and condominiums) shall have up to two (2) additional exterior only inspections during the same license year. Exterior only inspections shall include the inspection of all outdoor areas and structures, the exterior of the building, including the operation of all the exterior doors opening into common areas to verify Code compliance. These inspections shall be scheduled after the annual inspection has been conducted and repeated if necessary. The exterior only inspection process shall be subject to reinspections and reinspection fees. However, the exterior only inspection process cannot generate a semiannual inspection. If the property owner, landlord, property manager or other designated individual is not present at the scheduled time for the exterior inspection, the inspector shall not conduct the inspection.

The fee for a scheduled exterior inspection shall be at the same rate as the annual license fee less the per unit charge. (Ord. 10-26) 

Sec. 10-85.6. Payment of Certain Fees.  [back to top]

All reinspection fees shall be paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date the initial inspection was conducted or prior to the reinspection date, whichever occurs first. Fees for all semiannual inspections shall be paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date the annual inspection was conducted or prior to the semiannual inspection date, whichever occurs first. Fees for all exterior only inspections shall be paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date the annual inspection was conducted or prior to the first exterior only inspection date, whichever occurs first. Fees for a reinspection and/or for any additional inspections shall be listed on the inspection report; no invoices or additional notices shall be provided for the payment of these fees.

Section 10-85.7. Scheduling Inspections.  [back to top]

The Code Official, or his authorized representative, is hereby authorized and directed to make inspections in order to determine the condition of the dwellings, dwelling units, rooming units and premises (collectively a dwelling located within the Village). The sole purpose of such inspections shall be to determine whether such dwellings comply with the provisions of this Article, Section 15.3E of Chapter 15, Section 17-32 of Chapter 17, Section 1206 of the Subdivision Control Ordinance, and Chapter 24. The scope of such inspections shall be strictly limited to those areas of the dwelling that are required to be in compliance with this Article and Chapter 24.  For the purpose of making such inspections, the Code Official or his authorized representative is hereby authorized to enter, examine and survey all dwellings and related areas and uses in the Village. 

If the dwelling is vacant, the Code Official shall inform the owner of the scheduled inspection and shall request permission to enter the dwelling for the purposes of the inspection.

If a dwelling is occupied by a tenant, the landlord shall inform the tenant of the scheduled inspection and shall request permission from the tenant that the inspector be permitted to enter the dwelling if the tenant is not home at the time of the inspection. Failure to be granted permission shall require the landlord to provide in writing, the tenant’s name, unit number and phone number to the Code Official no later than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time of the scheduled inspection.

Every inspection and reinspection shall be scheduled in writing.

The property owner or his/her designee has the responsibility to meet the inspector at the time of scheduled inspection. Failure to meet the inspector at the time of the scheduled inspection shall result in the imposition of a no-show fee equal to one hundred dollars ($100.00) for buildings with 1-17 units and one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for buildings with 18 units or more for the first failure during a license year. Additional failures to be present on the prescribed date and time are subject to citations. The inspector must be present on site and allow an additional fifteen (15) minutes, unless confirmation from the property owner or their designee (of being late) is received before documenting that the inspection must be rescheduled.

Requests to reschedule an inspection shall be subject to a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) unless a request to change the inspection date is received a minimum of twenty-one (21) days prior to the inspection date. The notification time frame for the rescheduled inspection may be reduced to no less than five (5) business days within the date of the scheduled inspection if mutually agreed upon by the inspector and property owner and will not require written notification.

Sec. 10-86.      Inspection of Building, Violations, Suspension and Revocation of License.  [back to top]

(A)       Whenever, upon inspection of the licensed rental dwelling or rental dwelling unit, it is determined by the appropriate officials of the Village of Addison that conditions or practices exist which are in violation of the provisions of this or any applicable ordinance of the Village of Addison, the official making the determination shall serve the owner or agent with a notice of violation. Such notice shall identify the specific violations and state that unless they are corrected within the time specified in the notice the operating license may be suspended. Notice pursuant to this Section shall be sent by U. S. mail to or hand delivered to the party designated in the application to receive notices or process or their authorized representative. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Article, valid complaints or service requests regarding a non-responsive licensee shall be processed as follows:  After a tenant has notified the licensee or his designated representative of a Code violation, the licensee has an obligation to resolve the matter within a reasonable timeframe. If the Village is notified of the failure of the licensee to comply, the Village shall notify the licensee and investigate the complaint.  If the complaint is valid, and the licensee has not addressed the issue within seven (7) calendar days, the licensee shall be responsible for the payment of the inspection costs incurred by the Village and any subsequent reinspection costs. If it has been determined that the respective building has received four (4) or more valid service requests within twelve (12) months following the initial annual inspection, an additional inspection consisting of the building exterior, the interior common areas and all rental dwelling units shall be conducted and the building will be charged a fee the same as the initial license fee.  The licensee shall pay said costs within fifteen (15) days of notification of such inspection or reinspection. Such notification shall be either by the service of an inspection report indicating the fee or of a letter either mailed or hand delivered. Should the licensee fail to pay said costs in a timely manner, said failure shall be a violation of this Article and the licensee shall be subject to additional penalties as hereinafter set forth.  In addition, if the violation(s) found on the service request are not corrected within seven (7) calendar days after being notified by the Village, the valid service request shall be counted against the grade of the building as indicated in Subsection 10-85(B).  (Ord. 14-09; 15-04)

(B)       At the end of the time allowed for correction of any violation cited, the building shall be reinspected by the appropriate Village officials to verify compliance. If compliance has not been achieved or if significant progress has not developed, the Village of Addison may issue an order for suspending the operating license. Violations caused by the tenant shall not be considered grounds for suspension of license, if the licensee is diligent in achieving compliance. 

(C)       Any person whose license to operate a rental dwelling or dwelling unit has been suspended shall be given the opportunity to be heard by the Village of Addison in connection with the violations. Within twenty-one (21) days following the issuance of an order of suspension, the Village shall schedule a hearing to determine whether the license shall be revoked. The Village, as a result of such hearing, may grant additional time or may revoke the license. Prior to revocation any person whose license has been suspended may request a reinspection upon showing that the violation cited in the notice has been corrected.  

(D)       If the licensee is convicted by a Court of a violation of any applicable ordinance of the Village of Addison in connection with the licensed building, then the licensee shall be subject to revocation. 

(E)       In the event a condition of extreme hazard to health or safety is found to exist, the Village of Addison may immediately suspend the license. 

(F)       If, upon reinspection, it is determined by the appropriate Village officials that the violations cited in the notice have been corrected, the license shall be reinstated by the Village of Addison.  A request for reinspection shall not exceed the twenty-one (21) day suspension period unless the official responsible for sending the violation notice so requests.

(G)       Each day a building continues to operate after a license has been revoked shall constitute a separate violation of this ordinance subject to fine, as provided for in this Code.

(H)       Whenever the Code Official, upon presentation of proper credentials and request for entry to inspect, is refused access to any building, dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit, or premises, the Code Official is authorized to petition any judge for the issuance of a search warrant 10-authorizing the inspection of such building, dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises for the purpose of making such inspections as shall be necessary to the enforcement of the provisions of this Chapter or Chapter 24.

Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

(2)        Pedestrians facing such signal shall comply with the meaning of the circular green, steady yellow, steady red or straight-through arrow indication as if it were shown alone, unless directed otherwise by a pedestrian signal as provided in Section 11-99.

A driver facing this indication shall not drive in the lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present.  Otherwise, he shall obey all other traffic controls and follow normal safe driving practices.

(C)       Yellow X (steady).  A driver facing this indication shall prepare to vacate the lane over which the signal is located in a safe manner, to avoid, if possible, occupying that lane when a steady red X is displayed.  (Ord. 62-58)

No vehicle shall be operated on said industrial truck routes with a weight in excess of 20,000 pounds carried on any one axle or with a tandem axle weight in excess of 34,000  pounds, or a gross weight in excess of 80,000 pounds for vehicle combinations of five (5) axles or more, or a gross weight on a group of two (2) or more consecutive axles in excess of that weight produced by the application of the following formula:

W = 500 times the sum of (LN divided by N-1) + 12N + 36

where "W" equals overall gross weight on any group of 2 or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds; "L" equals the distance measured to the nearest foot between extremes of any group of 2 or more consecutive axles; and "N" equals the number of axles in the group under consideration, except that 2 consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more.  Provided also that a 3-axle vehicle manufactured prior to the model year of 1994, and first registered in Illinois prior to January 1, 1995, with a distance greater than 72 inches but not more than 96 inches between the 2 rear axles may transmit to the road surface a maximum weight of 18,000 pounds on each of the 2 rear axles.  Any such vehicle manufactured in the model year of 1994 or thereafter or first registered in Illinois after December 31, 1994, may transmit to the road surface a maximum of 34,000 pounds through the 2 rear axles and neither of the rear axles shall exceed 20,000 pounds.  For purposes of this Section, tandem axles shall be defined as any 2 or more single axles whose centers are more than 40 inches and not more than 96 inches apart, measured to the nearest inch between extreme axles in the series.

The above formula, when expressed in tabular form, results  in allowable loads as follows:


Distance measured to the nearest foot between the extremes  of any group of 2 or more consecutive axles

(B)       Stolen Vehicles:  When an unlawful vehicle is one that has been reported as stolen, the owner should be, when practicable, notified by telephone or other means and given the opportunity to claim or move the vehicle, if he so wishes, to avoid incurring the expenses of a police-ordered tow.  Provided, however, that the vehicle may be towed if the owner permitted the tow to be made when the vehicle was reported stolen or at any time thereafter.  Within twenty-four (24) hours after towing a vehicle pursuant to this Article, a notice shall be sent to or personally delivered to the owner of the vehicle affording the opportunity for a hearing as provided in Sections 11-142 and 11-143.

(C)       Towing with Prior Notice; Abandoned Vehicles.  Abandoned vehicles may be towed after the mailing or delivery of prior notice and the affording of an opportunity for a hearing as provided in Sections 11-140 and 11-141 and, to the extent required by law, after obtaining an appropriate court order allowing the tow from private property. 

Sec. 11-140.    Pre-Tow Notice for Abandoned Vehicles. [back to top]

(A)       Notice pursuant to this Section shall be personally delivered to the owner or shall be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated in the most current registration list of the Secretary of State.  In the event that an out-of-state vehicle is proposed to be towed, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made of the Secretary of State of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished, though in no case will the Village be required to delay towing more than seven (7) days after the date of the mailing or personal delivery of the notice if no request for a hearing has been received within that seven (7) day period.

(B)       A "notice of intent to tow" sticker, with the earliest date upon which the tow may take place and the address and phone number of the Police Department, shall be placed on the vehicle. 

Sec. 11-141.  Pre-Tow Hearing Procedures. [back to top]

(A)       Opportunity for Hearing.  The tower or person entitled to possession of a vehicle to be towed as an abandoned vehicle shall have seven (7) days after the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a pre-tow hearing.  Subsequent to this seven (7) day period, the vehicle may be towed if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the seven (7) day period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this Article will be deemed waived.

 (B)      Scheduling of Pre-Tow Hearings.  The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled for a date within fourteen (14) days of the mailing or personal delivery of the pre-tow notice.  The Village shall not be required to delay towing longer than such fourteen (14) day period.

(C)       Request for Pre-Tow Hearings.  Requests for a pre-tow hearing are to be made to the office of the Village Manager.  Requests for hearing by persons who reside more than fifty (50) miles from the Village may be made by mail.  Forms for such requests shall be made available at the Police Department.  At the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date and time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.

(D)       Appointment of Hearing Officer. The Village Manager or his designee shall serve as the hearing officer.  In no case shall that hearing officer be an individual who was involved in the initial decision to tow the vehicle.  The hearing officer shall have the authority to require the presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow or any other Village personnel.

(E)       Nature of Hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence shall not apply.  The hearing will not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle.  After receiving all relevant evidence, the hearing officer shall make a written decision based upon a preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is authorized by the laws of the State of Illinois or the ordinances of the Village, with a specific statutory or ordinance section cited in the decision.  The owner shall be provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision.

(F)       Decision to Tow and Rates To Be Charged. If the preponderance of the evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this Article, the hearing officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed or, to the extent required by law, than an appropriate court order for towing from private property be obtained, with any towing and storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof.  The fees to be charged for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by the Chief of Police pursuant to the provisions of Section 11-142(E).  The owner of said vehicle having had such a hearing may avoid the towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper location to a proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle. (Ord. 02-102)

(G)       Decision Not to Tow.  If the preponderance of the evidence fails to support towing of the vehicle, the hearing officer shall direct that the vehicle shall not be towed.  The Village shall furnish a copy of such decision to the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window.  No vehicle about which such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the Village unless the circumstances under which the decision was rendered have changed.  If at some subsequent time the Village should wish to tow the vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required for the towing of any other similarly situated vehicle.

(H)       Reports and Documents to be Retained; Contesting Decisions.  Originals or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police Department for a period of at least five (5) years after each hearing, or after each tow if no hearing was requested or held.  The Village or the owner may contest the decision of the hearing officer in any manner provided by law.

Sec. 11-142.    Post-Tow Notice for Hazardous and Unlawful Vehicles. [back to top]

(A)       Mailing or Delivery of Notice. Notice pursuant to this Section shall be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the owner of the hazardous or unlawful vehicle as indicated in the most current registration list of the Secretary of State unless the notice is personally delivered to the owner, in which case the date and time of delivery and the name of the police officer making the delivery shall be noted in the Police Department records or reports.  The notice shall be delivered within twenty-four (24) hours of the tow of the hazardous or unlawful vehicle in the manner provided in Section 11-140(A).  In the event that the Village has towed an out-of-state hazardous or unlawful vehicle, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made of the Secretary of State of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished.  (Ord. 02-102)

(B)       Posting of Signs Showing Hearing Rights.  All approved towing service operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least twelve inches by eighteen inches (12" x 18") indicating the opportunity and procedures for a hearing to contest the validity of the towing of the vehicle.  The sign shall be placed in locations readily visible to the public transacting business at any towing facility.  If a towing service operator performs services for more than one municipality, the information for contacting the various appropriate village offices can be listed in one such sign.

(C)       Request for Post-Tow Hearings. Requests for hearings are to be made at the office indicated on the notice within fifteen (15) days of the mailing or personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the vehicle, whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be deemed waived.  Requests for hearing by persons who reside more than fifty (50) miles from the Village may be made in person or by mail received within the fifteen (15) day period.

(D)       Release of Motor Vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove same, the owner or other person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his right to possession, sign a receipt for the vehicle, pay the administrative penalty to the Village (or a bond therefor), and pay the amount currently owed for towing and storage fees to the towing service operator.  The Chief of Police is authorized to promulgate regulations as to the documents or other proof necessary to establish these facts.  (Ord. 05-137) 

 (E)      Establishment of Maximum Towing and Storage Rates.  The owner shall pay fees to the towing service operator for towing and storage on police-ordered tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts to be administratively established by the Chief of Police and which may be revised from time to time.  The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and sign concerning vehicle release requirements.  However, nothing in this Article is intended to prevent a competitive towing service operator from charging less than the established maximum rates for police-ordered or any other tows.  In arriving at the maximum rates for various services, the Chief of Police shall consider such matters as the prevalent market rates in the area for the different types of vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for categories such as large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount of work required to perform various types of towing operations.  For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious accidents, the Chief of Police is authorized to allow towing operators to charge rates above those established for normal situations, which special charges must be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into account such matters as the man-hours and equipment time required for the job.  A towing service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such a billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow and supply a copy of the itemized bill to the owner and to the Police Department.  Any such special rates charged must be customary in the towing industry in the area for the nature and extent of the services provided.  Every towing service operator and the Police Department shall have available a copy of the complete current rate schedule and any special rate policy established by the Chief of Police for vehicle owners to view upon request.

Sec. 11?€‘143.  Post?€‘Tow Hearing Procedures. [back to top]

(A)       Opportunity for Hearing.  The owner of a vehicle towed as an immediate tow, by or pursuant to the authority of the Police Department as set forth in Section 11-142, shall be provided the opportunity for a post-tow hearing to determine the validity of such tow and any administrative penalty, towing or storage charges.  The hearing will not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation issued relative to any towed vehicle.  The owner shall be deemed to have waived any right to a post-tow hearing unless a hearing is requested within fourteen (14) days of the mailing or delivery of the post-tow notice, as provided in Section 11-142.

(B)       Nature of the Hearing/Hearing Officer.  The nature of the hearing and the appointment of the hearing officer shall be the same as set forth above in Sections 11-141(D) and 11-141(E).

(C)       Scheduling of Post?€‘Tow Hearings. The post?€‘tow hearing shall take place as follows:

(1)        In those instances where the vehicle has been released upon the deposit of the full payment currently owed for towing and storage charges and the owner has properly requested a hearing, the hearing shall take place within fifteen (15) days after the request for a hearing, unless the owner requests a later date convenient to all parties.

(2)        In those instances where the vehicle remains impounded, the hearing shall take place, at the option of the owner:

(a)        on the next day after an owner's demand for such hearing, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; if such demand is made after 3:00 P.M. or if the unavailability of a necessary witness or evidence creates a particular difficulty in conducting the hearing on the next calendar day, then a hearing shall be held on the second day following the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; or

(b)        if acceptable to the owner, within fifteen (15) days of said request on a date convenient to all parties.

(D)       Conduct of Post?€‘Tow Hearing.  The hearing officer shall review all evidence presented by the vehicle owner and the Police Department or other municipal employees and shall make a finding, based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented, as to the lawful authority for the towing and storage of the vehicle.  The Village must establish such authority by a preponderance of the evidence.

(E)       Post-Tow Hearing Decision.  For each hearing, the hearing officer shall complete a post-tow hearing decision, attach such decision to the Police Department's original vehicle towing report, and supply a copy of the decision to the owner by personal delivery if the owner is present, or by mail.

(F)       Reports and Documents to be Retained; Contesting Decisions.  All originals or copies of all notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police Department for a period of at least five (5) years after each hearing, or after each tow if no hearing was requested or held.  The Village or the owner may contest the decision of the hearing officer in any manner provided by law.

(G)       Towing Services Subject to Ordinance.  Notwithstanding any other ordinance or statutory provisions to the contrary, any towing service operator authorized to perform tows on behalf of the Village must perform its services subject to the provisions of this Article.  However, the towing company shall have the right to recover the reasonable value of its services for police-ordered tows, which are not paid by the vehicle owner, from the Village.  Provided, however, that if a tow or the charge for a tow is found by a court to be illegal and the towing service operator is required to return the charge for the tow to the owner of the vehicle, the Village shall not be liable to reimburse the operator for the towing charges.

Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.

The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of the Illinois Criminal Code.

Failure to request or attend a scheduled hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.  In the event of such failure, any amount deposited pursuant to Section 11-150(A) shall be forfeited.  A hearing provided in accordance with this Article shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or notice of parking violations issued relative to the immobilized vehicle but shall only relate to whether the vehicle was properly immobilized or towed.  (Ord. 11-03)

Sec. 12-37.      Procedure.  [back to top]

When the Director of Police of the Village receives one or more police reports documenting the occurrence of a nuisance activity on or within a property, the Director of Police shall independently review such reports to determine whether they describe nuisance activities.

Upon such findings, the Director of Police may:

(A)      Notify the owner and the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following information:

 (1)      The street address or legal description sufficient for identification of the property.

 (2)      A statement that the Addison Police Department has information that the property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the nuisance activities that may exist or that have occurred.

 (3)      Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of the determination by the Director of Police.

 (4)       A copy of the notice shall be served on the taxpayer of record at such address as shown on the tax rolls of the county and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these persons are different from the person in charge, and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage prepaid.

 (5)        The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this Article.

(B)       Should the owner or person in charge fail to prevent the property from becoming a chronic nuisance property, the Director of Police or his designee may commence proceedings to abate the nuisance conditions.  The Village shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to pursue nuisance abatement proceedings either in the Circuit Court of DuPage County, or through administrative adjudication of building and housing violations (as provided in Article III of Chapter 30 of this Municipal Code).

Sec. 12-38.      Judicial Remedies.   [back to top]

(A)       In the event the Village pursues a judicial abatement remedy and in the event that a court determines a property to be a chronic nuisance property, the court may order that the property be closed and secured against all use and occupancy for a period of time determined by the court or the court may employ any other remedy deemed by it appropriate to abate the nuisance.

(B)       In addition to the remedy provided in Subsection (A) above, the violator shall be subject to a fine of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day, payable to the Village of Addison, for each day the owner or his agent had actual knowledge that the property was a public nuisance property and permitted the property to remain a public nuisance property.

(C)       In determining what remedy or remedies to employ, the court may consider evidence of other conduct that has occurred on the property, including, but not limited to:

            (1)        The disturbance of neighbors.

            (2)        The occurrence of other nuisances on or from the property.

            (3)        The property's general reputation and/or the reputation of persons in or frequenting the property. 

(D)       The court may authorize the Village to physically secure the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court.  In the event that the Village is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the Village to affect the closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property and debt to the Village. As used herein, "costs" mean those costs actually incurred by the Village for the physical securing of the property.

(E)       The Village Building Department employee effecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs, and the Village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection to the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property.

(F)       Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the Village.

(G)      The court may order the owner’s, agent’s, or designee’s Addison Police Department Crime Free Multi-Housing Program Seminar certificate be suspended if the owner, agent or designee does not attend and complete an Addison Police Department Crime Free Multi-Housing Program Seminar Refresher Course within three (3) months from the court date.  If owner, agent, or designee attended a Crime Free Multi-Housing Program Seminar in a town other than Addison, Illinois, their exemption privilege will be suspended, if they do not attend and complete an Addison Police Department Crime Free Multi-Housing Program Seminar Refresher Course within three (3) months from the court date.

Completed permit applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing.  If the application does not conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of Public Works shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor.  If the Director of Public Works is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Article and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.  In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this Article.

(B)       Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications Retailers.

(1)        Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to commence work governed by this Article for facilities for the provision of telecommunications services.  Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the facilities and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation.  The Director of Public Works shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.

Sec. 17-606.    Effect of Permit.  [back to top]

(A)       Authority Granted, No Property Right or Other Interest Created.  A permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this Article on Village rights-of-way and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.

(B)       Duration.  No permit issued under this Article shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.

(C)       Preconstruction meeting required.  No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this Article prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting.  The preconstruction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village, with such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary.  The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.

(D)       Compliance with All Laws Required.  The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village Code and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, including but not limited to, the Addison Zoning Ordinance, as now existing or hereafter amended.

Sec. 17-607.    Revised Permit Drawings.  [back to top]

In the event the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work.  The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit.  If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this Article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with Section 17-621 of this Article.  If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

Sec. 17-608.    Insurance.  [back to top]

(A)       Required Coverages and Limits.  Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the Village and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) below. 

(1)        Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than 

(a)        Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to each person;

(b)        Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting from any one accident; and

(c)        Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of liability;

(4)        Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.

If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this Section.

(B)       Excess or Umbrella Policies.  The coverages required by this Section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies.  Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.

(C)       Copies Required.  The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this Section to the Village within ten (10) days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.

(D)       Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages.  The insurance policies required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:

"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or not to renew."

Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this Section.

(E)       Self-Insurance.  A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by Subsection (A) of this Section.  A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under Subsection (A) or the requirements of Subsections (B), (C) and (D) of this Section.  A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under Subsection (A) of this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.  Self-insurance shall be primary, and any Village policies of insurance shall be deemed secondary.

(F)       Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility' s Liability.  The legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.

(G)       Insurance Companies.  All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.  All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.

Sec. 17-609.    Indemnification.  [back to top]

17-610.            Security.  [back to top]

(A)       Purpose.  The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this Section.  The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.  The Security Fund shall serve as security for:

(1)        The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this Article;

(2)        Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this Article; and

(3)        The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this Article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this Article to perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the  permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this Article or any other applicable law.

(B)       Form.  The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village.    Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:

(1)        Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the permittee;

(2)        Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and

(3)        Provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.

(C)       Amount.  The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration.  Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit.  The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this Subsection (C) for any single phase.

(D)       Withdrawals.  The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund if the fund is a Cash Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period.  Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

(1)        Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;

(2)        Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;

(3)        Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or

(4)        Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that the Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.

(E)       Replenishment.  Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Cash Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Cash Security Fund to the amount specified in Subsection (C) of this Section.

(F)       Interest.  The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the Cash Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Cash Security Fund below the minimum balance required in Subsection (C) of this Section.

(G)       Closing and Return of Security Fund.  Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Cash Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this Article or other applicable law.  In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Cash Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.

(H)       Rights Not Limited.  The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this Article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the Village may have.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of a single authority shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to twenty-five (25) small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. Each consolidated application shall provide all the information required by subparagraph (2) of this Section for each small wireless facility at each location.

If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application.

(10)      Collocation Completion Deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for an authority utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

(11)      Duration of Permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable codes or local code provisions or regulations in subparagraphs (5) and (7)c of this Section.

If PA 100-0585 is repealed or found unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, all permits granted by the Village under this Chapter shall terminate at the end of their current term.

(12)      Means of Submitting Applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information, and notices by personal delivery or as otherwise required by the Village.

(13)      No Implied Warranties.  As to Village-owned infrastructure onto which wireless telecommunications facilities are to be considered for installation upon, no implied or expressed warranty is given, granted, inferred, etc. as t its capability to accept, support, etc. and/or provide for the needs of the wireless telecommunications facility installation.  The complete responsibility for assuring the support element’s ability will rest and lie entirely with the permit applicant. In the event the permit applicant’s selected Village-owned infrastructure is deemed inadequate by the permit applicant or applicant’s consultant, the Village will be under no obligation to augment or create a new element for the installation of the wireless telecommunication facility.

Sec. 17-705.    Application Fees.  [back to top]

Application fees are hereby imposed as follows:

(1)       Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars ($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure and three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures.

(2)       Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.

(3)       Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.

(4)       The Village shall not require an application, approval, or permit, or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:

a.        routine maintenance;

b.        the replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment consistent with the requirements of (2)a-g under the subsection titled Application Requirements; or

c.        the installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.

Wireless providers shall secure a separate Village permit to work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures.

Sec. 17-706.    Exceptions to Applicability.  [back to top]

Nothing in this Ordinance authorizes a person to collocate small wireless facilities on:

(1)       property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner;

(2)       property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or

(3)       property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this Ordinance do not apply to an electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed, and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.

For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to that term in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a) to obtain a franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject to this Ordinance.

Sec. 17-707.    Pre-Existing Agreements.  [back to top]

Agreements between the Village and wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on authority utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village’s utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject only to applicable termination provisions contained therein.

A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village makes available under this Ordinance for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two (2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the Village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms.  The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the Village’s utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph.

Sec. 17-708.    Annual Recurring Rate.  [back to top]

A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (i) two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year, per pole or (ii) the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider’s use of space on the Village utility pole. If the Village has not billed the licensee actual direct and reasonable costs, the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to occupy and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. Late payments shall carry simple interest of six (6) percent per month, non-prorated.

Sec. 17-709.    Abandonment.  [back to top]

A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment.

The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for authority utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.

A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless provider.

Sec. 17-710.    Dispute Resolution.  [back to top]

The Circuit Court of DuPage County has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under this chapter. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on authority utility poles within the right-of-way, the authority shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per authority utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.

Sec. 17-711.    Indemnification.  [back to top]

A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the Village harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the authority improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this Ordinance and the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability.

Sec. 17-712.    Insurance.  [back to top]

The wireless provider  shall  carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance: (i) property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all risks; (ii) workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or (iii) commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities on the authority improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of authority improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.

The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional non-contributory insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy prior to its co-location of any wireless facility.  The wireless provider shall disclose all self-insured retentions.

A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the Village.  A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this Section.  A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the Village.

Sec. 17-713.    Security Fund.  [back to top]

(A)      Purpose.  The wireless provider shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this Section.  The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the wireless provider’s sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.  The Security Fund shall serve as security for:

(1)       The faithful performance by the wireless provider of all the requirements of this Article;

(2)       Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the wireless provider 's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this Article; and

(3)       The payment by wireless provider of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by wireless provider in violation of this Article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the wireless provider is required by this Article to perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as a  consequence solely of the wireless provider 's failure to perform or complete and all other payments due the Village from the wireless provider pursuant to this Article or any other applicable law.

(B)       Form.  The wireless provider shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at the wireless provider’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:

(1)       Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the wireless provider;

(2)       Not require the consent of the wireless provider prior to the collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and

(3)       Provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.

(C)       Amount.  The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the wireless provider fails to perform such restoration.  Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the wireless provider to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit.  The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (C) for any single phase.

(D)      Withdrawals.  The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund if the fund is a Cash Security Fund, provided that the wireless provider has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period.  Withdrawals may be made if the wireless provider:

(1)       Fails to make any payment required to be made by the wireless provider hereunder;

(2)       Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;

(3)       Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the wireless provider; or

(4)       Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that the Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.

(E)       Replenishment.  Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Cash Security Fund, the wireless provider shall restore the Cash Security Fund to the amount specified in subsection (C) of this Section.

(F)       Interest.  The wireless provider may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the Cash Security Fund be returned to the wireless provider by the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Cash Security Fund below the minimum balance required in Subsection (C) of this Section.

(G)      Closing and Return of Security Fund.  Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the wireless provider shall be entitled to the return of the Cash Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the Village for failure by the wireless provider to comply with any provisions of this Article or other applicable law.  In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Cash Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the wireless provider.

(H)      Rights Not Limited.  The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this Article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the Village may have.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

Sec. 20-21.      Mains and Service Lines.  [back to top]

(A)       Horizontal separation.

(1)        Whenever possible, a water main should be laid at least ten (10) feet horizontally from any existing or proposed drain or sewer lines. 

(2)        Should local conditions prevail which would prevent a lateral separation of ten (10) feet, a water main may be laid closer than ten (10) feet to, or in the same trench as, a storm or sanitary sewer, provided the main is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf located to one side of the sewer and at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is at least eighteen (18) inches above the top of the sewer.

(3)        If it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal separation as stipulated in Paragraph (1) or (2) above, the sewer should be constructed of slip-on or mechanical joint cast iron pipe, asbestos cement pressure pipe or prestressed concrete pipe and be pressure tested to assure water tightness before backfilling.

(B)       Vertical separation.

(1)        Whenever water mains must cross house sewers, storm drains or sanitary sewers, the water main should be laid at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is eighteen (18) inches above the top of the drain or sewer. This vertical separation should be maintained for the portion of the water main located within ten (10) feet horizontally of any sewer or drain crossed, such ten (10) feet to be measured as the normal distance from the water main to the drain or sewer.

(2)        Where such conditions exist that the minimum vertical separation set forth in Paragraph (1) above cannot be maintained, or where it is necessary for the water main to pass under a sewer or drain, the water main should be laid with ductile iron pipe, and the pipe should extend on each side of the crossing until the normal distance from the water main to the sewer or drain lines is at least ten (10) feet. In making such crossing it is preferable to center a length of water main pipe over the sewer to be crossed, so that the joints will be equal distance from the sewer and as remote therefrom as possible.  Where a water main must cross under a sewer, a vertical separation of eighteen (18) inches between the bottom of the sewer and the top of the water main should be maintained, along with means to support the larger sized sewer lines to prevent their settling and breaking the water main. 

(C)       Water Service Lines.  The horizontal and vertical separation between water service lines and all sanitary sewers, storm sewers or any drain should be the same as for water mains; except that, when minimum horizontal and vertical separation cannot be maintained, brass, copper or lead, in addition to ductile iron, may be used for water service lines.

(D)       Before being placed in service, all new water mains shall be pressure tested for at least two (2) hours at one hundred  (100) pounds pressure per square inch and thoroughly flushed until the water is clear.  The main shall then be disinfected with chlorine gas by an accredited chlorination specialist, and water shall not be used until a satisfactory report has been received by the Water Department at least twenty-four (24) hours before the main is to be pressure tested or chlorinated, so that a representative can be present during the pressure test or chlorination procedure.

(E)       All water mains shall be of ductile iron pipe and shall comply with A.S.A. Specification A21.5-1965 (A.W.W.A. C151-65).  The thickness class of the pipe shall be determined according to the rule of design of A.S.A. manual A21-50-1965 (A.W.W.A.  H3-65), with a minimum thickness of Class 2.  The pipe shall have unit iron strengths of 62,000 P.S.I. tensile and 42,000 P.S.I. yield strength with ten (10) percent elongation.  All ductile iron pipe shall have cement mortar lining and shall comply to A.S.A. specifications A21.4, latest revision.

Pipe joints shall be either mechanical joint or bell-tite.

Fittings shall be of cast-iron and shall comply with A.S.A. specification A21.10, latest revision, with mechanical joints for 250 P.S.I. working water pressure (Ord. 68-15, §6.)

G.        B5 Planned Community Commercial/Office District (83-74)  [back to top]

1.         Purpose.  The Planned Community Commercial/Office District is an incentive zoning district intended to provide for alternative development of compatible commercial and office uses providing shopping, services and professional and business offices in locations which provide convenient access for residents of Addison and surrounding communities.  The District regulations include standards for site development intended to allow a scale of commercial and office use related to the available land area and surrounding areas, and encourage assembly of smaller parcels so that proper site development and access may be provided.  The District also provides specific standards for landscaping and other features to produce a high quality of site development.

2.         General Requirements. 

a.

c.         No outside storage shall be permitted in the district, and no variation to allow any outside storage may be granted; provided, however, that indoor storage, warehousing, showroom storage and distribution may be permitted as accessory uses if said uses are confined to less than 30 percent of the floor area of a particular use.

F.         M4 Office?€‘Research/Industrial District.  [back to top]

1.         Purpose.  The Planned Office-Research/Industrial District is an incentive zoning district intended to provide for office-research and nuisance-free industrial uses in a well-designed and maintained environment.  This district would be less intense in character than the M1 Limited Manufacturing District while providing a broader base of services to meet the needs not only of those working within the district, but also of the general public.  Ancillary limited commercial uses such as hotels, restaurants  and health clubs may be located in the district where access is available from the rest of the district and the surrounding road network.  Development in the district is to be characterized by innovative planning to provide a campus-like environment; spacious building sites with extensive setbacks; controlled ingress and egress; permanent landscaping of open spaces; and screening necessary to maintain a proper relationship with adjacent areas. (83-73)

2.         General Requirements.   The following general requirements, performance standards, uses, bulk regulations and development standards shall apply to all development in the Planned Office-Research/Industrial District, except for such variations as may be permitted by the Board of Trustees: (96-47)

a.         No district shall be established under this classification unless it is a compact, contiguous parcel of land, not less than 20 acres in size and under unified ownership or control at the time such district is established; or unless it is contiguous to an established Planned Office-Research/Industrial District and is at least five acres in size.

b.         No lot, parcel, or tract of land shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected unless a Special Use Permit for a Planned Unit Development is granted in accordance with  the following standards:

(1)       A Planned Development shall conform to all requirements of Section VII and Section VI. A, except that where there is a conflict between the requirements contained in this section and other requirements, the requirements of this section shall govern.

(2)       A Planned Development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots to be sold; undivided single ownership; separate condominium units; or other ownership methods, provided that any instrument by which the Planned Development is established shall be binding in perpetuity on all property within the Planned Development.

SECTION VII. PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS

Planned developments are of such substantially different character from other special uses that specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the action of the Village Board of Trustees. (12-06)

A.        Planned Development. [back to top] A planned development is a use of land which offers benefits to the neighborhood of which it is a part or to the general public welfare beyond those required by this Zoning Ordinance and which use of land will contain or provide amenities not otherwise required by law, including but not limited to provisions for common open space, recreational facilities, or specific design, engineering, architectural, site planning or landscape features.

B.        Application for Preliminary Approval of a Planned Development Special Use Permit. [back to top] Any person or persons owning lots or land within the Village or any person or persons owning lots of land outside the Village coming in under a pre-annexation agreement may apply to the Planning and Zoning Commission for preliminary approval of a planned development special use permit. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application and may approve or disapprove an application or make recommendations to the Village Board, regarding changes or revisions that it deems desirable. Following Village Board approval, which shall be valid for two years, the applicants may proceed with the preparation of the Final Planned Development. (12-06) 

C.        Final Approval of a Planned Development Special Use Permit. [back to top] The procedure for securing final approval shall be the same as in B. above, but the plans shall be in more detail. Final approval for each unit of the development as delineated in the preliminary approval by the Village Board shall be valid for one year. There shall also be submitted with the final plan, a written agreement of restrictions signed by the owners of the planned development, assuring the Village that the development will be carried out in full compliance with the final plan and within the time schedule of construction submitted with the final plan. 

D.        General Standards.   [back to top] A planned development shall conform to the following requirements: 

1.         The number of dwelling units erected shall not exceed the number permitted by the regulations of the district in which it is located unless an exception is permitted as stipulated under Bulk Regulations, E. sub-section of this section.

2.         The yards and open spaces adjoining the boundaries of the project shall not be less than the yard requirements of the district in which it is located.

3.         No building is permitted to exceed the height limit of the district by more than 10 percent.

4.         If more intensive uses (i.e.. uses other than which the district is zoned, such as B2 Community Business District usage in R3 General Residence Districts) are granted than are permitted by the district regulations, there must be clear evidence that such uses are needed to service the project, provided the Planning and Zoning Commission shall find:

a.         That the uses permitted by such exceptions are necessary or desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;

b.         That the uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the development nor on the surrounding neighborhood;

c.         That not more than 15 percent of the gross floor area of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by said exception;

d.         That in a Planned Industrial Development such additional uses allowed by exception shall conform with the performance standards of the district in which the development is located;

e.         That the use exceptions so allowed are recorded on the zoning district maps by appropriate symbols or by reference to documents on file with the Building Commissioner;

f.          Where the planned development is to be located in a residential district, no use exceptions shall be allowed unless the size of the planned development exceeds 10 acres.

5.         The amount of off-street parking must be adequate to serve the needs of the projects, and the Village Board may require more off-street parking than is otherwise required by this ordinance.

6.         If any open space or recreational facility is to be used solely by the residents of the project unless the development is under single ownership, adequate provisions shall be made for assessments against the property within the project so that such facilities can be properly improved, maintained and operated.

7.         Underground utilities including communications and electric systems, are required within the limits of a planned development. Appurtenances to these systems which can be effectively screened may be excepted from this requirement if the Village Board finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the development.

E.        Bulk Regulations.  [back to top] In the case of any Planned Development, the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend, and the Village Board may authorize, exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of this section within the boundaries of such development, provided that the Planning and Zoning Commission shall find: (12-06)

1.         That such exception shall be solely for the purpose of encouraging a desirable living environment no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such development, as well as of neighboring properties, than would be obtained under the bulk regulations of this ordinance for buildings developed on separate zoning lots.

2.         The maximum parcel coverage in a residential planned development may not exceed 30 percent in the residential zoning districts.

3.         Other standards for density, yard regulations, parking, loading and screening for a planned development shall be governed by the standards of the residential, commercial or industrial zoning district(s) most similar in nature and function to the proposed planned development as determined by the Village Board. Standards for public improvements shall be governed by the applicable ordinances and laws of the Village. Exceptions to these standards by the Village Board are possible when they find that such exceptions are warranted in terms of the total proposed development.  However, in regard to developments containing residential uses;

a.         In no event shall the floor area ratio exceed more than 15 percent over that prescribed in this ordinance for the district in which it is located.

b.         In no event shall the minimum square footage per dwelling unit requirements applicable to such districts be decreased by more than 15 percent.  A further decrease of not more than 10 percent on the already reduced square footage per dwelling unit may be permitted in the event that parking facilities are provided either underground or in the building proper, i.e. for each underground or on-building parking space, an equivalent reduction may be permitted to the allowable limit of 10 percent before specified.

F.         Issuance of Permits. [back to top] Whenever the Village Board approves the final plan and accompanying agreements, the Building Commissioner shall issue the necessary permits for all of the project or for such units thereof that are to be constructed. 

G.        Time Limit. [back to top] If no construction has been started within one year from the date of approval of the final plan, the permits shall be declared null and void and the project shall not be initiated unless it is resubmitted and reapproved in the same manner that it was approved in the first instance.  The Village Board may, however, extend the period for initiating construction upon a showing of good and sufficient cause. 

H.        Performance. [back to top] At the time of the granting of the permit, the Village Board shall make appropriate arrangements with the applicant which will insure the accomplishment at the scheduled times, of the public improvements and grants of easement shown on the approved final plan. 

SECTION VIII.   OFF-STREET LOADING AND OFF-STREET PARKING

A.        Off-Street Loading.

B.        Off?€‘Street Parking.  [back to top] Any off-street parking space in connection with existing buildings or structures shall not be removed, enlarged, or altered except in conformance with the requirements of this section.  In connection with any building or structure which is to be erected or substantially altered, and which requires off-street parking spaces; there shall be provided such off-street parking space in accordance with regulations set forth hereinafter.  The erection or substantial alteration of any building or structure shall be deemed a "new use" for purposes of this subsection.

1.         Use.  Except as may otherwise be provided for the parking of trucks or for special uses, required accessory off-street parking facilities required as accessory to uses listed herein shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants, or employees.

2.         Location. Parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the use served except uses, other than single or two-family dwellings, which are in existence on the effective date of this ordinance which are subsequently altered or enlarged. New uses in the B2 Business Districts and M2 General Manufacturing Districts may be served in accordance with requirements of this subparagraph by parking facilities located on land other than the lot on which the building or use served is located; provided such facilities are located within 300 feet walking distance from the main entrance to the use served.

3.         Computation.  When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this subsection results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.

4.         Collective Provisions for Non-Residential Uses.  Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements of each such use; and if all regulations governing the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served are observed.  However, no parking space or portion thereof shall serve as the required space for more than one use unless otherwise authorized in accordance with this section.

5.         Repair and Service.  No motor vehicle repair work of any kind shall be permitted in parking lots.  No gasoline or motor oil shall be delivered or conveyed in conjunction with any accessory parking facilities unless (a) such facilities are located within a completely enclosed building; (b) gasoline and motor oil may only be delivered within such building to the users of such facilities; ( c) the gasoline and/or motor oil shall not be delivered for retail sale; (d) no advertising sign is visible from outside the building; and (e) all gasoline pumps shall be effectively screened from view of the street.

6.         Dimensions of Parking Spaces.  Required off-street parking spaces shall be not less than 9 feet in width and not less than 18 feet in length in all districts.  Each parking space shall be delineated by a yellow or white delineator line not less than 4 inches in width.  The width of a parking space shall be measured from the center point of the delineator line.  The dimensions of a parking space shall not include access drives, aisles, ramps, columns, and office or work area.  Parking spaces shall have vertical clearance of at least 7 feet.  The dimensions of handicap parking spaces shall comply with the requirements of the Illinois Accessibility Code, nor shall this provision apply to the dimensions of loading or truck parking spaces as specified elsewhere. (01-23)

7.         Access.  Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon a driving aisle or a driveway of such width and design as hereinafter provided as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space.  A driving aisle designed for two-way traffic use shall have a minimum width of at least 24 feet and shall be marked with directional arrows. A driving aisle for one-way traffic shall be marked with directional arrows and shall have a minimum aisle width as follows:

For 45 degree or less parking:        minimum 15 foot wide driveway aisle
For 60 degree parking:                    minimum 18 foot wide driveway aisle
For 90 degree parking:                    minimum 24 foot wide driveway aisle

(02-01)

All off-street parking facilities shall be provided with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street, alley or driveway in a manner which will least interfere with traffic movements.

All parking areas, regardless of the number of spaces, shall have vehicular access to them via a street, alley or driveway containing all-weather, hard-surfaced pavement, and the location and route of such access shall be identified.  No driveway across public property shall have a width exceeding 24 feet, exclusive of curb returns.

The Zoning Administrator may grant a variation in driveway widths from 24 feet to 35 feet.  A variation can be granted only when the Zoning Administrator establishes the following:

The Village Board shall make separate decisions on both applications. If, during the course of a hearing on an application for an amendment the applicant's evidence tends to show that the development would constitute a planned development, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall treat the application as a joint application for the amendment requested and for the planned development special use permit. In such case the previously published notice of the hearing on the application for amendment shall be deemed to have constituted notice that an application for a planned development was requested.  However,  no application which requests any use exceptions pursuant to Section VII, shall be granted unless the previously published notice specifically indicated that such planned development special use permit was applied for, or unless the Planning and Zoning Commission orders an additional notice and hearing pursuant to Section VII.  The provisions of Section VII shall be printed on every application for an amendment.

4.         Application for Amendment.  An application for a zoning map or zoning text amendment shall be filed with the Director of Community Development in such form and accompanied by such information as required by the Planning and Zoning Commission.

5.         Processing.   An application for zoning pursuant to a proposed annexation or for a zoning text or map amendment to existing Village zoning shall be filed with the Community Development Department. The application shall be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission with a request to hold a Public Hearing. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall report its findings and recommendations to the Village Board.  The Community Development Department shall cause a sign to be placed on the land proposed to be rezoned within 10 days of the deadline for filing an application. Such sign shall be erected within 10 feet of the public right-of-way abutting the property.  If no public right-of-way abuts the subject property, the sign shall be placed in such a position as may be most readily seen by the public. If the land does not abut a public right-of-way, then in addition to a sign placed on the property, a sign shall be placed within 10 feet of the right-of-way of the nearest most traveled road providing permission has been granted by the owner of said property.

A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands for the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front considered as one building sewer.  In no case shall any person be permitted to maintain, without the consent of the approving authority, any sewer connection connecting a building owned by him to the public sewer across or under the property of another.

Old building sewers may be used in connection with new building only when they are found, on examination and test by the Director, Public Works, or designee, to meet all requirements of this Chapter.

No connection permit will be required for the removal of stoppage in waste pipes, or for replacing broken or old sewer lines, provided such sewer lines conform to the regulations contained in the section.

Section 23-12.   Building sewer, materials.  [back to top]

The methods and materials to be used in excavation, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and regulations of the Village

(A)       Connection, how made: Approved types of service connections shall be one of the following:

Type 1.            Vitrified clay wye branches installed in the main sewer at the time of construction.  Connections to existing wye branches shall be made with an approved type of joint material of the bituminous type or an approved compression coupling.  The connection shall be completely watertight.  No connection shall be allowed to any damaged wye branch.  If damage occurs during the making of the connection, the wye branch shall be taken out of the main sewer by the plumber and replaced either by another undamaged wye or by straight vitrified clay pipe.  If straight pipe is used in the replacement, type 2 connection methods shall be used.  Concrete encasement of the wye branch, connection joint, or any other part of the connection shall not be deemed watertight and shall not be allowed as a method of repairing a damaged joint.

Type 2.            Connections of the saddle type installed in the main sewer.  Connections of this type shall be made in a smooth, round hole, machine-drilled into the main pipe.  The fitting used in the connection shall be made in such a manner as to insure that no protrusion of the fitting into the main sewer pipe shall result.  The connector shall fit perfectly the contour of the inside of the sanitary sewer and shall be specifically designed to fit the particular size main sewer pipe into which the connection is made.  The machine-drilled hole shall be of such size to provide one-eighth inch (1/8") clearance between the outside of the fitting and the hole.  The space thus provided shall be completely filled with joint material.  The space between the shoulder of the fitting and the face of the main sewer pipe shall be one-eighth inch (1/8") thick and this space shall also be completely filled with joint material. 

The joint material used for the type 2 service connection shall be completely waterproof and shall be capable of withstanding any condition of stress or strain likely to be encountered in normal sanitary sewer construction or maintenance.  Concrete encasement will not be considered waterproof.

The fitting shall be manufactured of either cast aluminum alloy, cast iron or vitrified clay pipe and shall be capable of receiving all normally used type of pipe for service connections.

The type 2 fitting and drilling machine herein described shall be of the type manufactured by Smith & Loveless, Division-Union Tank Car Co., Lenexa, Kansas, or the approved equal.  Tapping and connection shall be made in the presence of an authorized village inspector.

Type 1 and 2 connectors, when and where used:  Type 1 connections maybe used in existing sanitary sewers when wye branches previously installed are readily and conveniently available.  If existing wye branches cannot be found readily or are not located properly for providing the needed service, type 2 connections may be made.  When new sanitary sewers are constructed type 1 connections may be made in cases where the connection is made during construction and before backfilling of the sanitary main sewer trench.

Type 2 connections shall be made in all cases where services are installed subsequent to construction and backfilling operations.  No wye branches shall be installed and covered up for future use, except when excessive depth, new subdivision design or other unusual conditions exist, and then only with prior approval of the Community Development Director and the board of trustees.

(B)       The size, slope alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench shall be in conformance to the requirements of the village.  In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the A.S.T.M. and WEF Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.

(C)       Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor.  In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 

(D)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, area-way drains or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.

(E)       The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Community Development Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer.  Each and every part of a sewer connection shall be inspected and approved by the Community Development Director or his representative before being concealed or backfilled. 

(F)       Any person filling in an excavation without having first received the written approval of the sewer or building inspector as provided in this chapter, shall, in addition to suffering the fine herein imposed, expose the sewer for inspection by the Community Development Director or building inspector at no cost to the village.  In any case where the inspector finds work on any sewer not done in a satisfactory manner as herein provided, he shall serve written notice on the person to whom the permit is issued, stating wherein such work is deficient, and ordering said person to remedy such defect within twenty-four (24) hours.  In the event such person fails to comply therewith, the inspector shall cause such defect to be corrected at the expense of the person to whom the permit was issued.   It shall be the duty of the inspector to inspect any sewer connection or sewer pipe within the village.  It shall also be the duty of said inspector to inform the approving authority of any violation of this article and to assist in the prosecution of offenders.

All excavations for building sewer installation shall comply with the provisions of this code relating to excavation in streets and shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.  Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the village.

(G)  New construction, redevelopment, tear-downs, or other modifications in areas where only a combined sewer exists shall be required to; (1) minimize and/or delay inflow contribution to the combined sewer, and (2) provide for separate domestic waste connection, distinct from the building inflow connection, to facilitate disconnection in the event a storm sewer becomes available.

(H)   Inflow sources on the combined sewer system are required to connect to a separate storm sewer system within twelve (12) months if one becomes available.

Section 23-13.   Grease, oil and sand interceptors.  [back to top]

Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be required and/or provided when, in the opinion of the Village, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, oil and/or fats in amounts in excess of discharge limits set forth in Section 23-32d., of this Chapter, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units.  All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Village of Addison and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.

Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.  They shall be of substantial construction, when bolted in place, shall be gas tight and watertight.

Section 23-16.   Wastewater service charges   [back to top]
The user charge system as hereinafter set forth has been developed from data outlined in the report of Pavia?€‘Marting and Company, Consulting Engineers, Roselle, Illinois, dated February, 1978 and updated 1990, 1992, entitled "User Charge and Industrial Cost Recovery System", said report being incorporated herein by reference and which shall constitute the basis for determining industrial and domestic user charges.

Section 23-17.  Basis for Wastewater service charges.  [back to top]

The wastewater service charges for the use of and for the service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the Village of Addison shall consist of basic user charge to pay fixed expenses of the cost of operation, maintenance and replacement of the system; a basic user rate to pay variable expenses of said operation and maintenance expense, and debt service charge to pay principal and interest of outstanding revenue bonds issued for sewer construction purposes.

Section 23-18.   Measure of flow.  [back to top]

The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of one thousand (1,000) gallons.  Surcharges may be computed using actual measured discharge flows upon written approval by the Director of the POTW, or by the use of the metered water consumption.

(A)       If the persons or other dischargers (industrial, commercial, etc.) discharging wastes into the public sewers procure and part, or all, of their water from sources other that the public waterworks system, all or part of which is discharges into the public sewers, the discharger shall, if directed by the Village of Addison, install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources.

(B)       Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records, or as a special requirement of an Industrial Pretreatment Permit as outlined in Chapter 23, Section 23-33.

(C)       Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned and maintained by the person.  Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the superintendent.

Section 23-19.   User Charges.  [back to top]

There shall be and there is hereby established a basic user charge and a basic sewerage user rate per thousand gallons for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the Village of Addison to be applied to each single metered or multiple unit served.  The specific rates are set forth in Chapter 20, Section 20-58, and said rates, as now existing or hereafter amended, are incorporated by reference herein.

Section 23-20.  Surcharge rate.  [back to top]

In the event use of the wastewater facilities by nonresidential users is determined by the Village to include wastes in addition to average strength domestic waste, the user shall pay a surcharge cost in addition to the debt service charge, the basic user charge and the basic user rate.

The rates of surcharge for BOD5, SS, and NH3-N shall be as follows:

Parameter

Cost

For BOD5 @

$0.3874/lb.

For SS @

$0.5961/lb.

For NH3 –N @

$1.4621/lb.

 

Section 23-21. Computation of surcharge .  [back to top]

The surcharge per user shall be computed by the following formula:

S = V (0.00834) [A(BOD5-200) + B(SS-220) + C(NH3-N)-15]
Where S = Amount of surcharge ($)
V = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per surcharge billing period
(0.00834) = Unit weight of water x 10 6 per thousand gallons
A = Unit charge for BOD, PER LB.
BOD5 = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand, average concentration for the surcharge billing period
B = Unit charge for SS PER LB.
SS = Suspended Solids average concentration for the surcharge billing period
C = Unit charge for NH3 N, PER LB.
NH3-N, Ammonia Nitrogen average concentration for the surcharge billing period

The concentration of wastes discharged in excess of average strength wastes shall be used for computing surcharges and shall be established by sewage flow metering and waste sampling.  Waste sampling and testing by an approved laboratory shall be completed by the discharger as often as may be deemed necessary by the Director of Public Works and/or Industrial Pretreatment Permit requirements and shall be binding as a basis for surcharge.

If the charge for such services is not paid by the due date (i.e. within twenty-one (21) days after billing date), the account will be delinquent.  If the account remains delinquent after an additional nineteen (19) days which includes the final notice period, all water and wastewater services shall be discontinued in the manner provided by Sec. 20-64 of this Code and shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled.

Sec. 23-25.      Lien-Notice of Delinquency..  [back to top]

Delinquent water or sewer charges shall be a lien on the premises, as provided by law.  Whenever a statement for sewer service remains unpaid for bi-monthly service twenty six (26) days after it has been rendered, the Village may file with the Recorder of Deeds of DuPage County a notice of the lien claim.  This notice shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid statement, and an assertion that the Village claims a lien for this amount as well as for the amount of all charges subsequent to the period covered by this statement.

If the consumer or user whose statement is unpaid is not the owner of the premises in question, the Village Clerk shall send to the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number, (a) a copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is delinquent in paying the charges or rates or other notice sufficient to inform the owner or owners of record, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number, that the charges or rates have become delinquent and (b) a notice that unpaid charges or rates may create a lien on the real estate under this Section.

The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting out (a) a description of such real estate sufficient for the identification thereof, (b) the amount of money due for such service, and (c) the date when such amount became delinquent.  The Village Clerk shall send a copy of the notice of the lien to the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number.  The Village has the power to foreclose this lien in the same manner and with the same effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate.

The Village also has the power, from time to time, to sue the occupant or user of the real estate in a civil action to recover the money due for services rendered, plus a reasonable attorney's fee, to be fixed by the court.  Whenever a judgment is entered in such a civil action, the foregoing provisions in this section with respect to filing sworn statements of such delinquencies in the office of the recorder and creating a lien against the real estate shall not be effective thereafter as to charge sued upon and no lien shall exist thereafter against the real estate for the delinquency.  Judgment in such a civil action operates as a release and waiver of the lien for the amount of the judgment.

Sec. 23-32e.    National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.  [back to top]

The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated.

(A)       Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Village of Addison may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with Section 23-32e.(c.) below.

(B)       When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Village of Addison may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users.

(C)       When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the Village of Addison convert the limits to equivalent mass limits.  The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Superintendent, or his/her designee.  The Village of Addison may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial User meets all the conditions set forth in Section 23-32(e)(c)(1)(A) through 23-32(e)(c)(1)(E) below. 

(1)        To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User must:

           (a)        Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;  

           (b)        Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;

           (c)        Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term average production rate.  Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;

           (d)         Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the Discharge; and

           (e)         Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User’s request for equivalent mass limits.

(2)        An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must:

           (a)         Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;

           (b)         Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 

           (c)         Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify the Superintendent, or his/her designee, whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in Section  23-32(e)(c)(1)(c).  Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Superintendent, or his/her designee, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and

            (d)        Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to Section 23-32(e)(c)(1)(a).  so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.

(3)        When developing equivalent mass limits, the Superintendent, or his/her designee:

           (a)         Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the Industrial User by the concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average Standard for the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor;

          (b)        Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and

           (c)        May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the Industrial User’s actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section 23-32g.  The Industrial User must also be in compliance with Section 23-34e.3(c)(4)(A).

           (d)         The Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users.  The conversion is at the discretion of the Superintendent.

           (e)         Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.   

           (f)          Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day Average, limitations.  Where such Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.

           (g)         Any Industrial User operating under   a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based Standard shall notify the Superintendent within two (2) business days after the User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month.  Any User notifying the Superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate.

Sec. 23-32f.     Pretreatment.  [back to top]

         (a)       All Industrial Users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with Chapter 23 and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by appropriate statutes, regulations and this Chapter.  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, as now existing or hereafter amended, shall be incorporated by reference into this Chapter 23.  Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the POTW shall be provided, properly operated and maintained at the User's expense.  All Industrial Users shall obtain all necessary construction operating permits from the IEPA and Wastewater Discharge Permit from the Village prior to commencing construction on such facilities.  Such pretreatment facilities shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA Certified Wastewater Treatment Operator.

           (b)         Any subsequent significant changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be accepted by the POTW prior to the Industrial User's initiation of the changes.

           (c)         Notification of changed discharge. All Industrial Users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, as outlined in Section 23-33(c)(d)(9), including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the Industrial User has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).

Sec. 23-32g.    Excessive Discharge - Dilution.   [back to top]

No User shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate pretreatment to achieve compliance with any limitations contained in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards (NCPS) (when effective), or in any other pollutant-specific limitations developed by the Village and/or as outlined in 40 CFR 403.6(d) in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Sec. 23-32h.    Spill Containment - Slug Control.  [back to top]

(A)       (1)        The Director of Public Works shall evaluate whether each Industrial User having the ability to cause Interference with the POTW treatment plant or to violate the regulatory provisions of this Chapter needs to provide accidental discharge/slug control plan protection for accidental discharge to the POTW of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Chapter and/or provisions set forth in 40CFR403.12(f).  Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or User's own cost and expense.  The POTW may incorporate specific, preventative actions directly into the permit conditions of a Significant Industrial User in lieu of development of a slug control plan as outlined in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii)(B)(6). 

(2)        All Industrial Users whose wastewater includes or could include compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause interference with the POTW must have detailed plans on file at the Village showing facilities and operating procedures to provide protection from accidental discharge.  All Industrial Users shall complete construction of said facilities by January 1, 1987.  No User who begins contributing to or could contribute such pollutants to the POTW shall be permitted to introduce such pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge facilities and procedures, as appropriate, have been approved by the Village and installed by the Industrial User.  Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the Industrial User from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of Chapter 23.

(3)        In case of an accidental or deliberate discharge of compatible or incompatible pollutants which may cause Interference at the POTW or will Pass Through the POTW or violate requirements of this  Chapter and/or 40CFR403.8, it shall be the responsibility of the Industrial User to notify the Village of the incident within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset.  The notification shall include name of caller, location and time of discharge, type of wastewater, concentration and volume.

(4)        Within five (5) days following such an accidental or deliberate discharge the Industrial User shall submit to the Village a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future occurrences.  Follow-up reports may be required by Village as needed.  Such report, or reports, shall not relieve the Industrial User of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve the User of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this Chapter or otherwise.  Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the Village, result in the revocation of the dischargers Wastewater Discharge Permit.

(5)        The Industrial User shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

(6)        A notice in English and the language of common use shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge of a prohibitive material.  Employers shall insure that all employees who are in a position to cause, discover, or observe such accidental discharges are advised of the emergency notification procedures.

(B)       An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:

(1)        A description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges.

(2)        A description for promptly notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a specific prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5) days.

(3)        A description of stored chemicals.

(4)        Any procedure to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run?€‘off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 

(5)        Any follow-up practices to limit the damage suffered by the treatment plant or the environment.

(C)       Notice of potential problems, including slug loading:  As outlined in 40CFR 403.12(f) and 40CFR403.8(f)(2)(vi), all categorical and non?€‘categorical IU's shall notify the POTW immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined by 40CFR 403.5(b), by the IU.  The IU must notify the POTW immediately of changes that occur at the facility affecting the potential for a Slug Discharge, thereby allowing the POTW to reevaluate the need for a slug control plan or actions to prevent such discharges.

Section 23-32i    Hazardous Waste Discharge Notification   [back to top]           

a.)       An Industrial User shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of would be a hazardous waste as defined in 40CFR Part 261. The procedure for notification is as outlined in 40 CFR 403.12(p).                 

b)        All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this Chapter, or within 180 days after the commencement of a new discharge that contains a listed hazardous waste.                 

c)        Discharges are exempt from the requirements above if during a month an Industrial User discharges no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as defined in 40CFR261.30(D) and 261.33 (e).

For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow?€‘proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible.  The POTW may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any IU that demonstrates that flow?€‘proportional sampling is infeasible.  In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the IU demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.

                                    iii.        Sample based on the flow of the sampled stream as follows:  (composite samples are required where feasible)

                                               a)      Where the flow of the stream being sampled is less than or equal to approximately 250,000 gpd, the Significant User shall take a minimum of three samples within a two-week period.                            

                                               b)      Where the flow of the stream being sampled is greater than approximately 250,000 gpd, the Significant User shall take a minimum of six samples within a two-week period,                          

                                    iv.        Take the samples immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists.  If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, in order to evaluate compliance with the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, the Significant User shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR Section 403.6(e).  Where an alternate concentration has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the POTW.                   

                                    v.         Submit, only with POTW authorization, information that utilizes only historical data, so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures.

                                    vi.        Provide the time, date and place of sampling, sampling methods and methods of analysis and certification that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW during the period required by the report.                            

                       P.)        The Significant User shall provide a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the Industrial User and certified by a qualified professional indicating whether National Categorical Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance measures (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required for the Significant User to meet the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.

                       Q.)        If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, the Significant User will provide the shortest schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M.  The completion date in this schedule will not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard.                         

                                    i.          Where the Significant User's National Categorical Pretreatment Standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR Section 403.7) or the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR Section 403.6(e)), or net/gross calculations (40 CFR Section 403.15), at the time the Significant User submits an application the information required in Section 23-33c.(b)(4)(P) and (Q) shall pertain to the modified limits.                             

                                    ii.         If the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard for the Significant User is modified after the discharge application is submitted, the Significant User shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as a response to Section 23-33c.(b)(4)(P) and (Q) and submit them to the Village within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.             

                       R.)        The following conditions shall apply to any compliance schedule submitted in response to Section 23-33c.(b)(3)(Q):        

                                    i.          The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the User to meet the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).                                   

                                    ii.         No increment referred to in Section 23-33c.(b)(3)(Q) shall exceed nine months.                            

                                    iii.        Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the User shall submit a progress report to the POTW including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule established.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the POTW.

                       S.)                    Any requests for a monitoring waiver (or renewal of an approved monitoring waiver) for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge shall be based on Section 23-33e.(b)(4) of this Chapter.

c)         Review of Wastewater Discharge Permit Applications               

           The Village will evaluate the data furnished by the Significant User and may require additional information.  The evaluation process may, at the discretion of the Village, include the inspection of the facilities of the applicant.  After evaluation of the data available, the Village may issue a Wastewater Discharge Permit.  No temporary permit will be issued by the Village except as set forth in Section 23-33c.(h) 

d)        Permit Conditions

           Wastewater Discharge Permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this Chapter and all other applicable regulations, user charges and fees established by the Village.  Wastewater Discharge Permits shall contain the following:

           2)         Where the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards are modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR Section 403.7) or the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR Section 403.6(e)) or net/gross calculations (40CFR Section 403.15) or Fundamentally Different Factor Variance for nontoxics (40 CFR Section 403.13), of the General Pretreatment Regulations, the limits as modified shall be made a part of the Wastewater Discharge Permit and shall be adjusted consistent with USEPA guidelines and regulations.

           3)         Limits on maximum and average flow rate and time of discharge or requirements for flow regulation and equalization for each separate discharge of a User.

           4)         Requirements for installation and operation of inspection, sampling and monitoring facilities.

           5)         Specifications for monitoring and/or self monitoring programs which may include sampling locations, frequency of sampling, number, types and standards for tests and reporting schedule.

           6)         Compliance schedule, if necessary for the installation of technology required to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements as outlined in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii).

           7)         Requirements for submission of technical reports or discharge reports as outlined in 40CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii).

           8)         Requirements to retain for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring activities and results relating to wastewater discharge and for affording the POTW access to said records.

           9)         Requirements for advance notification to the POTW of any new introduction of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater treatment system pursuant to the terms of Section 23-33c.(e) of Chapter 23.

e)         General Permits         

           1)         At the discretion of the Superintendent, the Superintendent may use general permits to control SIU discharges to the POTW if the following conditions are met.  All facilities to be covered by a general permit must: 

                       A.)       Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;

                       B.)       Discharge the same types of wastes;

                       C.)       Require the same effluent limitations;

                       D.)       Require the same or similar monitoring; and

                       E.)        In the opinion of the Superintendent, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual wastewater discharge permits.

           2)         To be covered by the general permit, the SIU must file a written request for coverage that identifies its contact information, production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for monitoring all wastes covered by the general permit, any requests in accordance with Section 23-33e – (b)(4) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, and any other information the POTW deems appropriate.  A monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general permit until after the Superintendent, or his designee, has provided written notice to the SIU that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with Section 23-33e.

           3)         The Superintendent will retain a copy of the general permit, documentation to support the POTW’s determination that a specific SIU meets the criteria in Section 23-33c(e)1, A through E and applicable State regulations, and a copy of the User’s written request for coverage for three (3) years after the expiration of the general permit.

           4)         The Superintendent may not control an SIU through a general permit where the facility is subject to production-based categorical Pretreatment Standards or categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per day or for IU’s whose limits are based on the Combined Wastestream Formula or Net/Gross calculations.

f)          Notification of Violations                   

           In the event an IU's sampling data indicates a violation, the IU must notify the POTW within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The IU must then repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results to the POTW within 30 days as per 40CFR403.12(g)(2).                            

g)        Change in Conditions

           In the event the type, nature, quality or volume of wastewater from the property for which a Wastewater Discharge Permit was previously granted is excepted to materially and substantially change as reasonably determined by the permittee or Village, the permittee previously granted such must notify the Director of Public Works in writingthirty (30) days prior to any planned changes to the users operations or system and shall make application to the Village prior to said change, in the same manner and form as originally made, provided that information previously submitted and unchanged need not be resubmitted by permittee.  No permittee shall materially and substantially change the type, nature, quality or volume of its wastewater beyond that allowed by its permit without prior written approval of the Village.                             

h)         Duration                   

           Wastewater Discharge Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) years.  The Permittee shall file an application for renewal of its permit at least 90 days prior to expiration of the User's permit.  The Industrial User shall apply, on a form provided by the POTW, for re-issuance of the Permit.  Upon re-issuance, any applicable provisions of the Wastewater Discharge Permit shall be incorporated as conditions of the new Wastewater Discharge Permit.  The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the Village during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in Part 300 are modified or other just cause exists.  The Significant User shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change.  Where any changes are made in the Significant Industrial User's permit, a reasonable time shall be given to achieve compliance.                                

i)         Transfer                      

           Wastewater Discharge Permits are issued to a specific Significant User for the process activity specified in the permit.  A Wastewater Discharge Permit shall not be assigned, transferred or sold to a new owner or new user in different premises or to a new or change operation in the same or different premises without the approval of the Village.  If the premises are sold or other wise transferred by the permittee to a new owner who will maintain the operation in the same premises, then the permit held by the seller shall be reissued by the Village to the new owner as a temporary permit; provided that the new owner shall immediately apply for a new permit in accordance with this Chapter and further provided that the temporary permit shall only be effective for ninety (90) days after the date of sale or transfer.  The Village shall have the same remedies for violation of temporary permits as it has for violation of other discharge permits.                 

j)         Deadline for Compliance with Categorical Standards Compliance by existing sources with categorical Pretreatment Standards shall be within 3 years of the date the Standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N.  Direct dischargers with NPDES permits modified or reissued to provide a variance pursuant to Section 302(i)(2) of the Act shall be required to meet compliance dates set in any applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard.  Existing sources which become Industrial Users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard shall be considered existing Industrial Users except where such sources meet the definition of a New Source  as defined in 403.3(k).  New Sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards before beginning to Discharge.  Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), New Sources must meet all applicable Pretreatment Standards.

Sec. 23-33d.    Denial of Permit and Appeal Procedure.  [back to top]

a)        No discharge permit shall be issued by the Village to any person whose discharge of material to sewers, whether shown upon his application or determined after inspection and testing conducted by the Village, is not in conformity with Village Codes, Ordinances, Zoning, Regulations, or whose application is incomplete or does not comply with the requirements of Section 23-33c.(b)(c) as applicable.  The Village shall state the reason or reasons for denial in writing, which shall be mailed or personally delivered to the applicant within ten (10) days after denial.                    

b)        If the application is denied by the Village, the Industrial User may obtain review of the denial by the Village Board of Trustees, provided that the Industrial User shall give written notice of this request therefore, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such denial.  The Village Board of Trustees shall review the permit application, the written denial and such other evidence, written and oral, and matters as the applicant and the Director of Public Works shall present.  The decision of the Village Board of Trustees shall be final.                                              

c)        Any person, including the User, may petition the Superintendent to reconsider the terms of an individual or general permit within 30 days of issuance of the permit.                                 

           1)         Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.                              

           2)         In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit.                               

           3)         The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.                              

           4)         If the Superintendent fails to act within thirty (30) days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied.  Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of appeal.                                  

           5)         If the request to reconsider or modify a permit is denied by the Superintendent, the Industrial User may obtain review of the denial by the Village Board of Trustees, provided that the Industrial User shall give written notice of this request therefore, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such denial.  The Village Board of Trustees shall review the permit application, the written denial and such other evidence, written and oral, and matters as the applicant and the Director of Public Works shall present.  The decision of the Village Board of Trustees shall be final.

Sec. 23-33e.    Reporting Requirements for Permittee.  [back to top]

a)        Report on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline.

           Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards or in the case of a New Source  following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, an Industrial User subject to Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the Village of Addison control authority a report containing the information as described paragraphs 1?€‘3 below.                                       

           For Industrial Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Village in accordance with the procedures in 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the Users long term production rate.  For all other Industrial Users subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.

           1)         Flow Measurement                             

                       The User shall submit information showing the average measured daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:                   

                       i)           Regulated process streams; and                          

                       ii)          Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula as outlined in 40CFR403.6(e).                 

                                    The Village of Addison control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations.                     

           2)         Measurement of pollutants

                       i)           The user shall identify the Pretreatment Standards applicable to each regulated process;                      

                       ii)          In addition, the User shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the Standard or Control Authority) of regulated pollutants in the Discharge from each regulated process.  Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported.  The sample shall be representative of daily operations;                  

                       iii)         Sampling of discharge shall be performed as described in Section 33-33c.(b)(3)(O) of this document; with the exception of subparts iii and v.                

                       iv)         The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph;     

                       v)          Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists.  If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards.  Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Village of Addison control authority;                 

                       vi)         Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto.  Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator;                                 

                       vii)        The report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant Discharges to the POTW.         

           3)         Certification  

                       A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the Industrial User (as defined in Section 23-33i.) and certified to by an Illinois registered professional engineer, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the Industrial User to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.                                              

b)        Periodic Compliance Reports

           1)         Any User subject to an applicable pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such applicable pretreatment standard or, in the case of a New Source, after discharge of wastewater to the POTW begins, shall submit to the Village on or before the 15th day of the months of January, April, July, and October for the preceding calendar quarter, a certified report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such applicable pretreatment standards.  For User’s subject to semi-annual monitoring, a report shall be submitted on or before the 15th day of the months January and July for the preceding six-month period.  In addition, this report may include requirements to record the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.                          

            Significant Noncategorical Industrial User shall submit to the POTW once every quarter (on or before the 15th of the months of January, April, July, and October for the preceding calendar quarter) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the Village of Addison control authority.  These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. 

In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the User must submit documentation required by the Pretreatment Standard and/or Superintendent necessary to determine the compliance status of the User.                    

           2)         Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other persons, approved by the Director.  This sampling and analysis may be performed by the POTW in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user.  Where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, the non-categorical significant industrial user will not be required to submit the report.                         

           3)         At the discretion of the Village, this report shall also include concentrations of BOD/COD/TSS or other pollutants specified by Village.  Permittee shall sample and analyze its wastewater for BOD/COD/TSS or other pollutants at the discretion of Village as set forth in the permit issued to permittee or as outlined and dictated in the Federal Code of Regulation guidelines.                       

           4)         The Village of Addison may authorize an Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at background levels from the intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User.  This authorization is  subject to the following conditions:                          

                       i)           The Waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater                                              

                       ii)          The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than 5 years.  The User must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See Section 23-33b.(b)(3)(S) of this Chapter.                           

                       iii)         In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.                             

                       iv)         The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with Section 23-33i, and include the certification statement in 23-33i.(D).        

                       v)          Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.          

                       vi)         Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Superintendent must be included as a condition in the User’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Superintendent for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.                      

                        vii)        Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User’s permit by the Superintendent, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement noted below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User:

“Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40CFR______ (specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard Part), I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of _________________ (list all pollutants) in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under the provisions of Section 23-33e.(b)(4).”                  

                       viii)        In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User’s operations, the User must immediately:  Notify the Superintendent; and comply with the monitoring requirements of Section 23-33e.(b)(1) or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Superintendent.        

                       ix)         This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.                    

           5)         If an IU subject to the reporting requirements in Section 23-33e.(b)(1) or (2) of this section monitors their effluent for any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the Discharge Monitoring Report for that period.                   

           6)         At the discretion of the Village and in consideration of such factors as a local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or individual company performance, the Village may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are submitted.                        

           7)         All wastewater sampling and analysis performed for discharge monitoring must be representative of the users discharge.            

c)        All Industrial Users that generate pretreatment hazardous or special wastes from a facility shall be required to submit a report to the POTW which will describe the waste disposal methods of the Industrial User. The report shall state the volume of waste produced on an average daily basis, whether it is on a dry or wet basis, the ultimate method and location of the sludge disposal and the Permit Number authorizing the disposal.  The report shall be submitted with the first Periodic Compliance Report unless directed otherwise by the POTW.  The IU shall also submit copies of manifests for sludge hauling, special wastes, hazardous wastes and/or waste by-products. Copies of the manifests shall be submitted to the Village as part of the periodic compliance reports.                          

d)        Reporting requirements for IU's upon effective date of categorical Pretreatment Standards baseline report.                                              

           Within 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40CFR403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing Industrial Users subject to such categorical Pretreatment Standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the Village of Addison control authority, a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs 1-3 of this section and Section 23-33e.(a)(1) and (2).                       

           Where reports containing this information already have been submitted to the Director of Public Works in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 126.140(b)(1977), the Industrial User will not be required to submit this information again.  At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge.  New Sources, and sources that become Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical Standard, shall be required to submit to the POTW a report which contains the information listed in paragraph 1 of this section and Section 23-33e.(a).  New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards.  New Sources shall give estimates of the information requested in Section 23-33e.(a)(1) and (2).                         

           1)         Identifying information.

Sec. 23-33f.     Monitoring Facilities.  [back to top]

a)        All Significant Users shall provide and operate at the User's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems.  Such monitoring facilities shall be provided at the end of a process and/or at the end of the pretreatment as required for Industrial Users subject to Categorical Standards.  Pollutant concentrations and other prohibitions will be monitored at the end of the pipe.  The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the Users premises but the Village may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the User, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the User. (Also reference Chapter 20-54)                               

b)        Whenever required by permit, any Significant Users shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber for each separate discharge in the building?€‘sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Village installed and maintained at all times at User's expense, which shall have ample room in each sampling chamber to permit the Village to take accurate composite samples for analysis.  The chamber shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to authorized representatives of the Village twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.                                     

           1)         The IU may be required to install a Palmer-Bowlus, Parshall flume or equivalent in each sampling chamber unless a weir or similar device is approved by the Village with a recording and totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity or,                                     

           2)         At the discretion of the Village the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as the liquid quantity where it is substantiated to the Village that the metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the Village is made in the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity.  Categorical Significant Industrial Users (SIU’s) shall be required to read and record the incoming water meter on a daily basis.  Non-Categorical  SIU’s may be allowed to read the water meter at the beginning and end of the reporting period to calculate the daily average flow.                                    

           3)         Sampling shall be performed as required by the User's Wastewater Discharge Permit.  The Village shall have the right to perform its own sampling at any reasonable time.                                 

           4)         The sampling chamber, metering device, and documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection and verification by the Village.                                       

c)        All measurements, tests, and analyses to which reference is made in this Chapter shall be determined and performed in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.12(g), as amended from time to time where sampling and analytical techniques are not contained in said Federal Register reference, or are inappropriate for a pollutant, sampling and analyses should be performed using validated analytical methods as approved by the Village.                                       

d)        All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard.  If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.

Sec. 23-33g.    Inspection, Sampling and Records Keeping.  [back to top]

a)        The Village may inspect the facilities of all Industrial Users and/or require the completion of an industrial survey form provided by the Village to ascertain whether the purposes of Chapter 23 are being met and if all requirements of Chapter 23 are being complied with.  Persons or occupants of premises in which a discharge source or treatment system is located or in which records are kept shall allow the Village or its representative ready access upon presentation of credentials to all parts of said premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and photocopying of records required to be kept by Chapter 23, and in the performance of any of their duties.  The Village shall have the right to set up on the User's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, monitoring and metering operations of wastewater and sludges. Where a User has security measures in force which would require suitable identification necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Village shall be permitted to enter immediately for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.  Such arrangements shall be made by Users with their security guards within 30 days of the enactment of Chapter 23.

b)        The Village and Industrial Users shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this Chapter and, in the case of Industrial Users, shall include:

           1)         The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples;

           2)         The dates analyses were performed;

           3)         Who performed the analyses;

           4)         The analytical techniques/methods use; and                                           

           5)         The results of such analyses.                              

c)        The Village and Industrial Users shall maintain such records for a minimum of three (3) years.  This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the Industrial User or operation of Village pretreatment program or when requested by the USEPA Regional Administrator or the Director of IEPA.

Sec. 23-33h.    Confidential Information.  [back to top]

A)       Information and data relating to an Industrial User obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction unless the User specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Village, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the User.  All effluent data shall be available to the public without restriction.

B)       Private information (as defined in Sec. 2 of 5 ILCS 140/1of the Freedom of Information Act as “unique identifiers, including a person’s social security number, driver’s license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses.

Sec. 23-34a.    Publishing Lists of IU's with Significant Violations.  [back to top]

General Pretreatment Regulations require the Village of Addison to publish, at least annually, in the largest daily newspaper within the Village of Addison, a list of industrial users which were significantly violating applicable pretreatment standards and requirements during the previous twelve months as outlined in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vii)(A)-(H).

Section 23-34b.           General Description of Enforcement Management System (EMS).  [back to top]

The purpose of the Village of Addison POTW Enforcement Management System (EMS) is to provide guidance for Addison's staff in all phases of enforcement related to Addison's Industrial Pretreatment (IPT) Program.  General guidance has been provided by the Village of Addison Board of Trustees by Chapter 23, but specific application of that general guidance to the range of possible enforcement actions is needed.  The EMS and Enforcement Response Guide (ERG) are intended to implement portions of Chapter 23 and/or PIRT requirements as per 40 CFR 403.8(f)(5).

Sec. 23-34c.    Enforcement Management System.  [back to top]

Chapter 23 implements Addison’s Pretreatment Program mandated by the Clean Water Act and the General Pretreatment Regulations. It provides local limitations on discharges in Section 23-32, permits for categorical and significant industrial users in Section 23-33, describes enforcement actions and enforcement response in Section 23-34, and describes penalties and costs in Section 23-35. The enforcement philosophy is progressive; that is, problems are intended to be addressed at the lowest level and with the least formality possible consistent with the specific problem, however, no enforcement procedure is contingent upon the completion of any less formal procedure. For particularly severe violations as defined, Formal Enforcement Compliance Actions may be initiated immediately without the use of Letters of Violation, Compliance Meeting, Compliance Schedules and/or Compliance Directives.

Section 23-33 of Chapter 23 requires that all categorical, or significant industrial users obtain a wastewater discharge permit as a condition of discharge. Permits may be for a period as along as five years, and may limit wastewater constituents and flows, may require installation and operation of sampling and monitoring facilities, establish compliance schedules and require submission of periodic reports and notices as needed. The wastewater discharge permit represents Addison’s first means of controlling the wastewater discharge by categorical, or significant industrial users. The IPT permit also represents a major enforcement tool for Addison’s use against industrial users violating Addison’s IPT Ordinance.

Sec. 23-34d.    Department of Public Works: General Responsibilities  [back to top]

Sec. 23-34d.1.    General.

The Enforcement Management System is administered by the Superintendent, Public Works Department, under the general supervision of the Public Works Department Director.  The Public Works Superintendent may delegate tasks to his subordinates.  The Superintendent shall maintain complete, accurate records of activities conducted as part of the Enforcement Management System and render periodic reports to the Village of Addison Board of Trustees at such frequency and in such detail as the Board shall determine.  Specific responsibilities are set forth in succeeding sections of this document.

Sec. 23-34d.2.    Collection and Dissemination of Information.

For each industrial user, the Superintendent, or his/her designee, shall determine what data is required or needed to determine compliance with applicable pretreatment standards as well as when, how, and in what time frame it can be obtained. The Superintendent, or his/her designee, shall specify reporting requirements for each industrial user in its permit as required by United States Environmental Protection Agency and shall then track the submission of reports.  If information submitted is deficient or late, the industrial user shall be notified (within 30 days) and required to complete the submission as detailed in the appropriate enforcement response.                                 

Baseline monitoring reports, 90 day compliance reports, reports required by the compliance directives and continuing compliance reports as received shall be retained for at least three years under the provisions of 40CFR403.112(n).       

The Superintendent, or his/her designee, shall notify significant industrial users of applicable pretreatment standards and any RCRA requirements as described in 40 CFR, Part 403.8(f)(2)(iii).  By reporting the results of Village of Addison sampling and analysis to industrial users, the Superintendent, or his/her designee, will provide feedback to users on compliance status and inform industrial users of their compliance with Addison's enforcement requirements and Addison's general responses to instances of noncompliance.

Sec. 23-34d.3.    Sampling and Inspection of Industrial Users.

The Superintendent shall prepare and continually update an inspection plan for field investigations including sample collection, facility inspections and flow monitoring.  Field investigations shall be used to verify compliance status, to monitor industrial user self-monitoring activities, to collect samples, to initiate emergency or remedial action and to gather additional information.  Village of Addison personnel may conduct routine compliance monitoring or special monitoring in response to violations, technical problems or support for permit modifications.  The Superintendent shall further develop such checklists, procedures, and frequencies for routine inspections and sampling as are necessary to assure that the results of each visit are documented and notify industrial users of any deficiencies found during any inspection and/or inspection POTW sampling and inspections of all SIU's shall be in as outlined in 40CFR403.8(f)(2)(v).  Investigation and/or sampling collection follow-up reports shall be mailed to the IU within 30 days following the inspection and/or sample collection results.  The Superintendent shall advise Region V of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency of its routine and special field investigation activities each year.  Joint investigations of industrial users with the Environmental Protection Agencies may be conducted by mutual agreement.

Sec. 23-34d.4.    Compliance Screening.

Using all available information, the Superintendent, or his/her designee, shall conduct an initial compliance review or screening process to determine and assess compliance with schedules, reporting requirements and applicable pretreatment standards within five (5) working days.  Such screening shall be undertaken at quarterly Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) Submittal Review.  Reviews completed under this section are designed to identify apparent violations rather than determining an appropriate enforcement response to such apparent violations.           

During the screening process, the reviewer shall verify that any required reports are submitted on schedule, that they cover the proper time period, include all information required in the particular report and are properly signed.  As part of this process, the reviewer will compare the information supplied with the requirements in the industrial user's permit.  Discrepancies between information provided and information required by Chapter 23 and/or the Industrial Users Permit shall be considered to be a violation of the ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  To the extent possible, the industrial user will be required to correct such discrepancies immediately upon their discovery.

Sec. 23-34e.    Enforcement Procedures.  [back to top]

Sec. 23-34e.1.    Enforcement Evaluation.

Violations and discrepancies identified during the compliance screening process will be reviewed by the Superintendent, or his/her designee, within five (5) working days to evaluate the type of enforcement response required.  The enforcement response guide will be used for this determination, however, enforcement shall be initiated within 30 days, unless the violation threatens health, property, or the environment, which in those cases, the violations shall receive immediate response.                                      

The Public Works Superintendent, or his/her designee, will set deadlines for industrial users to respond to letters of violation.  If contacts and commitments are oral, they will be confirmed in writing to preserve the record.

Sec. 23-34e.2.    Significant Noncompliance (SNC).

After completion of the compliance screening, violations will be characterized and a determination made as to whether the user is in Significant Noncompliance (SNC).  Certain instances of noncompliance are not of sufficient impact to justify extensive enforcement actions. However, certain violations or patterns of violations are significant and must be identified as such.  Such Significant Noncompliance (SNC) may be on an individual or long?€‘term basis of occurrence.  Categorization of industrial users as being in Significant Noncompliance (SNC) allows Addison to establish priorities for enforcement action and provides a means for reporting on the significant industrial user performance summary.  Instances of SNC are industrial user violations which meet one or more of the following criteria and/or criteria as set forth in 40CFR403.8(f)(2)(vii):                               

a)         Violations of Wastewater Discharge Limits.                      

           1)         Chronic Violations.  A pattern of significantly violating applicable pretreatment standards and/or requirements set forth in Village of Addison, Chapter 23, or IPT Permit, indicated by sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six- (6-) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including Instantaneous Limits as defined, or                            

           2)         Technical Review Criteria (TRC) Violations.  Equal to or greater than thirty-three percent (33%) of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit, including Instantaneous Limits as defined, by more than the TRC in a six month period.  The Technical Review Criteria (TRC) for BOD, TSS and Oil and Grease is 1.4 X limit.  All other pollutants are 1.2 X limit except pH, or

           3)         Any other violation or violations of an effluent limit (daily maximum, Instantaneous Limit, or longer-term average) that has or have caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference (e.g. slug loads or contamination of sludge) or pass-through as defined in Chapter 23; or endangered the health of Village of Addison personnel or the public, or

           4)         Any discharge of a pollutant which has caused imminent endangerment to human health/welfare or to the environment and resulted in the Village of Addison exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.

           5)         Violations of compliance schedule milestones, contained in compliance directive or plan approved following a Compliance Directive, for starting construction, completing construction, and attaining final compliance by 90 days more after the schedule date, unless due to good and valid cause.

           6)         Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-monitoring data, or categorical standards (baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, and periodic reports), within 45 calendar days from the due date.  When Addison returns such reports to a permittee because they are incomplete, inaccurate or improper, failure to resubmit corrected reports within 45 days to the Village of Addison.

           7)         Failure to accurately report

           8)         Reporting false information

           10)       Discharging without permit or approval or when such discharge causes, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through including endangerment to the health of POTW personnel or the general public.

           11)       Refusal by significant industrial user to allow access by Addison POTW personnel to its premises with proper ID.

           12)       Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance.

           13)       Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best Management Practices, which the Director of Public Works determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the industrial pretreatment program.

           14)       Any other a violation or group of violations of similar nature to those set forth in Paragraphs A(1)-(14) which the Village of Addison considers to be significant.

Section 23-34e.3. -      Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations

a)        Upset

            1)         For the purposes of this section, upset­ means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

            2)         An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3), below, are met.

            3)         A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

                       A.         An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

                       B.         The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

                       C.         The user has submitted the following information to the Superintendent, or his/her designee, within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days):

                                    i.          A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;

                                    ii           The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

                                    iii         Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

           4)         In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

            5)         Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.

            6)         Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

b)        Prohibitive Discharge Standards

           1)         A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 23-32b.(a) of this Chapter or the specific prohibitions in Section 23-32b.(b)  through Section 23-32(e) [not including 23-32b.(b)(1) and 23-32b.(b)(3)] of this Chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:                                      

                       A.         A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or                    

                        B.         No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the Village of Addison was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.                       

c)        Bypass                                    

           1)         For Purposes of this Section,                          

                       A.         Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a User’s treatment facility.                   

                       B.         Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.                               

            2)         A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraph (3) and (4) of this section.

           3)         Bypass Notifications

                        A.        If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Superintendent, or his/her designee, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.    

                       B.         A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent, or his/her designee, of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The Superintendent, or his/her designee, may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.                                          

           4)         Bypass                                      

                       A.         Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent, or his/her designee, may take enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless                                  

                                    i.          Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

                                    ii.          There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and  

                                    iii.        The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section.                                        

                       B.         The Superintendent, or his/her designee, may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)(A.) of this section.

Description of Enforcement Activities / POTW Officials Who Are Responsible For Enforcement Response Initiation

The categories of enforcement activities are described in the succeeding paragraphs.  No enforcement procedure outlined within this section, or the Enforcement Response Guide is contingent upon the completion of any less informal or formal procedure.  For particularly severe violations as defined, Formal Enforcement Compliance Actions may be initiated immediately without the use of Letters of Violation, Compliance Meeting, Compliance Schedules and/or Compliance Directives.  The POTW Officials who shall be responsible for the initiation of enforcement procedures shall be the Public Works Director, Superintendent of Public Works, the Environmental Compliance Coordinator, or the Industrial Pretreatment Inspector.

The Environmental Compliance Coordinator and Pretreatment Inspector shall be responsible for the inspection of all facilities, review of records, and determination of compliance with reporting requirements and effluent standards.  The Environmental Compliance Coordinator shall determine the appropriate level of enforcement, and carry out all informal actions, and formal actions up to and including Civil Penalties.

The Director or Superintendent of Public Works shall carry out all enforcement action above Civil Penalties, to include Revocation of Permit, Show Cause Hearing, Termination of Service, and Injunctive Relief.

Sec. 23-34f.1.     Informal Actions.

Informal Notice to Industrial User.  Informal notice consists of personal contact, telephone calls or reminder letters to an appropriate official of an industrial user.  The Environmental Services Superintendent may use such a call or letter to notify industrial user of a minor violation and to seek an explanation, suggest the exercise of more due care or notify the violator that subsequent violation of the same type may be dealt with more severely.  Such informal notice may be used to correct minor inadvertent noncompliance and to demonstrate that the Village will note and follow up on all instances of noncompliance.  Instances of informal notice shall be reduced to writing to preserve the record.

Sec. 23-34f.1.a.  Compliance Inquiry Letter (CIL)

A Compliance Inquiry Letter (CIL) is a written notice to the industrial user that the Addison POTW has observed a violation of pretreatment standards or requirements and expects the noncompliance to be corrected and explained together with a statement that additional enforcement action may be pursued if corrections are not accomplished in a timely manner.  A Compliance Inquiry Letter (CIL) shall also state that an explanation of the violation does not excuse it or any previous violations.  Compliance Inquiry Letter (CIL) may be sent to certified mail, return receipt requested, with copies maintained in the industrial user's file.

The industrial user is hereby required to submit to the Village of Addison within 15 days of the date of the letter a written response to the cause of the violation and steps taken to prevent future excursions.

Sec. 23-34f.1.b.  Informal Review Meetings.

Where violations of Village of Addison Chapters have occurred, or appear to have occurred, the user may be notified by the Superintendent, in writing, as to the particulars of the violation and call for a voluntary meeting with the industrial user.  The meeting held shall be called an Informal Review Meeting.  Informal Review Meetings are intended to provide a voluntary means of preventing future violations of Addison's Pretreatment Program.

Sec. 23-34f.2.     Formal Actions.

Sec. 23-34f.2.a.  Pre-Enforcement Compliance Meeting.

In cases where, following a review meeting, continued violations occur or where violations of themselves are either of significant magnitude of duration, a user may be required through a "Notice of Violation" (NOV) to attend a "Pre-Enforcement Compliance Meeting"(PEC).  The Notice of Violation (NOV) shall contain the particulars of such violation(s) and set a time and place for the Pre-Enforcement Compliance Meeting.  Attendance is mandatory by the industrial user and failure to comply with such a notice may result in an order for Show Cause Hearing or suit for fines or penalties or such other remedies as are provided by Village Chapter 23.  The Pre-Enforcement Compliance Meeting (PECM) shall establish procedures, investigations, studies and compliance measures as the Village deems necessary and desirable to control and prevent violation of this Chapter 23.  The industrial user shall cooperate fully with the Village in making such investigations and studies.  Following the completion of the PEC Meeting, as described in Section 23-34f., the Village may issue compliance directive(s), or enter into a consent order, specifying actions to be undertaken.  Actions may include studies to identify and solve the problem, installation of pretreatment, and/or other actions deemed necessary.  Time tables may be established to complete any such actions as are required.  Failure to comply with Compliance Directive(s) from the Village of Addison shall be deemed a violation of the provisions of this Chapter and may be grounds for Enforcement Compliance Monitoring, revocations of the Industrial Users Wastewater Discharge Permit, and/or grounds for such other action as may be authorized for violation of Chapter 23.

Sec. 23-34f.2.b.  Issuance of Citations.

Issuance of Citations for violations of the Terms and Conditions of this Chapter.  Issuance of citations is as outlined in Section 23-35a.

Sec.  23-34f.2.c. Order To Show Cause Regarding Disconnection and Appeal Procedure.

The Village may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge or violates Addison’s pretreatment program to show cause before the Village of Addison Board of Trustees why the Village of Addison Board of Trustees or its designee, should not revoke the user's wastewater discharge permit or take such other enforcement action as is dictated by the facts of the case.  The Public Works Director, or designee, shall issue such Orders for Show Cause Hearings and they shall be served upon the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Board of Trustees, or its designee, of the Village of Addison regarding the violations, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and shall direct the user to show cause before the Board why such action should not be taken.  The notice of hearing shall be served personally or by certified or registered mail.  Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation or agent of a partnership.  Show Cause Hearings shall be conducted by the Board of Trustees, or its designee, as specified in Village Chapter 23.

Subpoenas shall be issued by the Mayor of the Village of Addison, or designee, upon request of any party to compel attendance of witnesses at such hearing.  All testimony shall be under oath in accordance with rules of procedure and evidence developed by Addison's Board of Trustees for the conduct to show cause hearings.

Following such hearing, Addison's Board of Trustees may take such action as it deems appropriate in the circumstances, including, but not limited to/seeking injunctive relief, revocation of permit, direction that discharge be ceased immediately or after a specified period of time, that suit be instituted against the industrial user to collect fines and penalties or to terminate service or for such other purposes as directed by Addison Board of Trustees. A formal notice of the hearing results shall be sent, by certified or registered mail, to the Industrial User.                 

In the event a User is dissatisfied with the final hearing decision, the User shall file a written protest to the Village of Addison, Board of Trustees within 10 days of receipt of the notice. An Arbitration Board  shall be formed by the Public Works Director, or his designee, comprised of one attorney appointed by the Village of Addison, one attorney appointed by the User, and one selected and agreed to by the two appointees. The final ruling by a majority of the Arbitration Board shall be binding to both parties, and the costs for services of the Arbitration Board shall be shared equally by both parties.

                       A)         that the discharge permit be revoked and the service be disconnected or

                       B)         that following a specified time the permit shall be revoked and sewer service discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and operated properly to comply with the discharge permit or

                       C)         direct the User to cease the unauthorized discharged effective after a specified period of time or

                       D)         that such other relief as deemed necessary by the Village of Addison Board of Trustees or its designated hearing officer(s) to abate the discharge be granted.  Further orders and directives as are necessary may be issued.

           5)         Following an order of revocation, the User shall cease discharging to the Village POTW.  Failure to do so shall be evidence of continuing harm to Village and provide grounds for the granting of injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders.

c)        Appeal Procedure      

           1)         The Appeal Procedure for the Industrial User shall be as outlined in Section 23-34f.2.c

Sec. 23-34f.2.e.     Immediate Disconnection of Service.

a)         Conditions for Immediate Disconnection of Service

           Any User is subject to immediate disconnection of service under either of the following conditions:

           1)         Whenever immediate disconnection is required to halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to the Village to present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons; or

           2)         Whenever the User's Wastewater Discharge Permit is revoked.

b)     Procedures for Immediate Disconnection                                              

           1)         Not withstanding Sections 23-34f.(2), 23-34f.(2)(c) or 23-34f. (2)(d), the Public Works Director shall have the authority, after informal notice to the User, to immediately and effectively halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW that reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.  When the Director of Public Works determines that such an emergency situation exists, he shall issue a verbal order (followed by a written order) to the User stating the problem and requiring immediate cessation and desist of the discharge.  The Director actions may include disconnection of wastewater collection service.  The Director shall obtain the concurrence of the Village Attorney before initiating action.  Methods of informal notice shall include, but not be limited to, any of the following:  personal conversation between User and Village employees, telephone calls, letters, hand delivered messages or notices posted at the User's premises or point of discharge.

Sec. 23-34f.2.f.  Elimination of Discharge/Reinstatement.

Any user notified of a disconnection of wastewater treatment service under Sections 23-34f.(2) or 23-34f.(2)(e) and/or revocation of its Wastewater Discharge Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge.

Hydrographs for the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year, 24-hour events shall be routed through any detention structures included in the drainage system and the results displayed as part of Section 26-201, SubSections A and B.

(C)       Wet Bottom Detention Basin. Wet bottom detention basins shall be designed to remove storm water pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible, to be available for recreational use.

(1)        Depths - Wet basins shall be at least 3 feet deep, excluding near shore banks and safety ledges.  If fish habitat is to be provided, they shall be at least 10 feet deep over 25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out. 

(2)        Permanent Pool Volume - The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2-year event.

(3)        Nuisance Control - Wet basins shall be designed in a manner which will reduce as much as practicable nuisance problems such as algae and waterfowl.

(D)       Dry Bottom Detention Basins. Dry bottom detention basins shall be designed to remove storm water pollutants, to be  safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses.

(1)        Drainage - Dry basins shall be designed so that 80 percent of their bottom areas shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event.  Basins shall have a minimum two percent bottom slope.

(2)        Water Quality - All dry detention basins shall be designed to remove storm water pollutants.  At a minimum, dry detention basins should be designed to capture the 2-year, 24-hour runoff event and hold it for at least 24 hours.

(E)       Safety.  The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events.

(1)        Shorelines - The shorelines of all detention basins shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance.

(2)        Banks - The side slopes of the banks of wet bottom detention basins shall not be steeper than 5 horizontal to l vertical above the normal water level and 3 horizontal to l vertical below the normal water level.  The side slopes of the banks of dry bottom detention ponds shall not be steeper than 5 horizontal to l vertical.

(3)        Safety Ledge - All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge extending 5 feet into the basin from the shoreline and 2 feet below the normal water depth.

(4)        Velocity - Velocities throughout the drainage system shall be controlled to safe levels, taking into consideration rates and depths of flow.

(F)       Infiltration Practices. Infiltration practices, including basins, trenches, and porous pavement, shall only be allowed in soils considered "A" or "B" by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.  Infiltration practices shall not be located within 75 feet of a water supply well or a building foundation.  A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from storm water flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches.  Storm water shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80 percent of a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be exfiltrated.  The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of 4 feet above seasonally high ground water and bedrock.

(G)       Detention in Floodplains.  Storm water detention facilities are not allowed in the floodway unless permitted by the Illinois Department of Transportation, Department of Water Resources.  (Ord. 91-60)

(H)       General Detention Considerations.

(1)        Overflow Structures - All storm water detention basins shall be provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing flows in excess of the 100-year event.

(2)        Length to Width Ratio - All detention basins should have a length to width ratio of at most 3 to l as measured along the longitudinal axis of flow.

(3)        Inlet and Outlet Orientation - As much as feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized.  If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin.

(4)        Velocity Dissipation - Baffles or berms should be placed perpendicular to the direction of flow through a detention basin to reduce velocity and prevent scour.

(5)        Freeboard - The top of bank shall be a minimum of one foot above the 100-year capacity elevation.

(6)        No detention facility shall be constructed within a distance of 10 feet plus one and one-half times the depth of the facility adjacent to any property line unless an easement is established for the purpose of a detention pond across this property line.  (Ord. 91-60.)

(I)        Maintenance.  The storm water drainage system shall be designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance.  Turfed side slopes shall be designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them.  Presedimentation basins shall be considered for localizing sediment deposition and removal.

Sec. 26-206.    Flows from Tributary Areas.  [back to top]

Storm water runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage system.  The upstream flows may be routed around the applicant's detention basin through an underground piping system.  The upstream flows may be routed through the applicant's detention basin in which case the basin release rate shall be the sum of the allowable release rate for the applicant's property tributary to the basin and the upstream flows.

Sec. 26-207.    Early Completion of Detention Facilities.  [back to top]

Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be completed before general property grading begins.  This is to ensure that if soil erosion and sediment control practices are not adequately implemented, any eroded sediment will be captured in these areas and will have to be removed by the applicant before project completion.

Sec. 26-208.    Maintenance.  [back to top]

Maintenance of storm water drainage facilities located on private property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property.  Before a permit is obtained from the Village of Addison, the applicant shall execute a maintenance agreement with the Village of Addison guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its storm water drainage system.  The maintenance agreement shall also specifically authorize representatives of the Village to enter onto the property for the purpose of inspections of the drainage system.  Each agreement shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of DuPage County.  The maintenance agreement shall include a schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect of the property's storm water drainage system and shall provide for access to the system for inspection by authorized personnel of the Village of Addison.  The maintenance agreement shall also stipulate that if the Village Engineer of the Village of Addison notifies the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require correction, the property owner shall make such corrections within 30 calendar days of such notification.  If the corrections are not made within this time period, the Village may have the necessary work completed and assess the cost to the property owner.

The Village of Addison has the option of requiring a bond to be filed by the property owner for maintenance of the storm water drainage system.

Article 3.  Floodplain Management.

Sec. 26-301.    Duties of the Enforcement Official. [back to top]

The Village Engineer shall be responsible for the general administration and enforcement of this Chapter, which shall include the following:

(A)       Determining the Floodplain Designation. Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).

Sec. 26-302.    Base Flood Elevation.[back to top]

This Chapter's protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance Study for the Village.  If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository.  When a party disagrees with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to DWR, FEMA, and the Village.

(A)       The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHA's of Salt Creek and Westwood Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of the Village prepared by FEMA and dated January 16, 1987, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.

(B)       The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHA's of those parts of unincorporated DuPage County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the Village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of DuPage County prepared by FEMA and dated October 15, 1981, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.

(C)       The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Village.

(D)       The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHA's delineated as an "A Zone" on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Village shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Survey Floodplain Information Repository.  When no base flood or 100-frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a Riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-2, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP.  The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-l TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges.  Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans.  Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to DWR for approval; once approved, it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing.  For a non-riverine SFHA, the Base Flood Elevation shall be the historic Flood of Record plus 3 feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois State Water Survey.

Sec. 26-303.    Occupation and Use of Flood Fringe Areas.[back to top]

(A)       Development Permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the Village Engineer.

(1)        Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Village Engineer.  The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect, or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in M.S.L., 1929 adj. datum or N.G.V.D. and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings.  For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of Section 26-306 of this Chapter.

(2)        Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Village Engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  Any development located on land that  can  be  shown  to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this Chapter.  The Village Engineer's office shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.

(3)        The Village Engineer shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant, copies of all other local, state, county, and federal permits, approval or permit-not- required letters that may be required for this type of activity.  The Village Engineer may not issue a permit unless all other local, state, and federal permits have been obtained.

(B)       Preventing Increased Damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety.

(1)        If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.

(2)        Compensatory Storage.  Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by one and one-half times the hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  The excavation volume shall be at least one and one-half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.  In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.  All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.  All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.  All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

Sec. 26-304.    Occupation and Use of Identified Floodways.[back to top]

This Section applies to proposed development, redevelopment, site modification, or building modification within a regulatory floodway.  The regulatory floodway for Salt Creek and Westwood Creek shall be as delineated on the regulatory floodway maps designated by DWR according and referenced in Section 26-103.

The Village Engineer may not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained.  A Registered Professional Engineer, under the employ or contract of the Village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this Section.

(B)       Preventing Increased Damages and a List of Appropriate Uses.  The only developments in a floodway which will be allowed are Appropriate Uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocities or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.  Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this Chapter.  Only those Appropriate Uses listed in 92 Ill.Adm.Code 708 will be allowed.  Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting design to act as a fence), and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an Appropriate Use.

(1)        The approved Appropriate Uses are as follows:

(a)        Flood control structures, dikes, dams, and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.

(b)        Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping, and other functionally water dependent uses.

(c)        Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls.

(d)        Underground and overhead utilities.

(e)        Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions.

(f)         Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage.

(g)        Bridge, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto. 

(h)        Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed l.0 feet) and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation.

(i)         Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive non-erosive slope toward a watercourse.

(j)         Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than 10 feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure.

(k)        In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced, and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building.

(l)         Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase the building's foot print and are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the building. 

(2)        Within the regulatory floodway, as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by DWR, the construction of an Appropriate Use will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations, and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of Section 26-306 of this Chapter.

(a)        Preservation of Flood conveyance so as Not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood.  In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:

(i)         Regulatory floodway conveyance,

 "K" = 1.486 AR2/3

    n

where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross- Section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter.  (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, Mc Graw-Hill Book Company, New York.)

(ii)        The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover.

(iii)       Transition Sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance.  The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:

a.         When water is flowing from a narrow Section to a wider Section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every 4 feet of the flooded stream's length.

b.         When water is flowing from a wide Section to a narrow Section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.

c.         When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every 10 feet of stream length shall be used.

d.         Transition Sections shall be provided between cross-Sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties.

e.         All cross-Sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.

(b)        Preservation of Floodway Storage so as Not to In-crease Downstream Flooding.  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.  Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least l.5 times the volume of floodway storage lost.  Artificially  created  storage  lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.  The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation.  All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.  All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.  All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.  If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to DWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.  Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.

(c)        Preservation of Floodway Velocities so as Not to Increase Stream Erosion or Flood Heights.  For all Appropriate Uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the proposed work will not result in more than a ten percent an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.  However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion, and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.

(d)        Construction of New Bridges or Culvert Crossings and Roadway Approaches.  The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.l foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases  will  be contained within the channel banks  (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements.  If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.l feet, the developer must contact DWR, Dam Safety Section for a Dam Safety permit or waiver.

(i)         The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in Section 26-302 of this Chapter.  Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA-Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts.  Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation procedures.

(ii)        Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per Section 26-304(B)(2)(b).

(iii)       Velocity increase must be mitigated per Section 26-304(B)(2)(c).

(iv)       If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a Department of Transportation permit must be received. 

(v)        The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to DWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by Section 26-304(B) (2)(n).

(vi)       All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per Section 26-304(B).

(e)        Reconstruction or Modification of Existing Bridges, Culverts, and Approach Roads. 

(i)         The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.l foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage.

(ii)        If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.

(iii)       The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules 92 Ill.Adm.Code 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to the Division for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.

(f)         On-Stream Structures Built for the Purpose of Backing Up Water.  Any increase in upstream stream flood stages greater than 0.l foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements.  A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from DWR, Dam Safety Section for a Dam Safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow.  All dams and impoundment structures as defined in Section 26-103(B) shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Ill. Adm.  Code 702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams).  If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:

(i)         The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional storm water detention.

(ii)        The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning.

(iii)       The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions.  Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin.

(iv)       A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.  If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control.

(v)        The project otherwise complies with the requirement of Section 26-304.

(g)        Floodproofing of Existing Habitable, Residential and Commercial Structures.  If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than 10 feet from the outside of the building.  Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities.

(h)        Excavation in the Floodway.  When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other Appropriate Uses, transition Sections shall be provided for the  excavation.  The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency.

(i)         When water is flowing from a narrow Section to a wider Section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every 4 feet of the flooded stream's length.

(ii)        When water is flowing from a wide Section to a narrow Section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.

(iii)       When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every 10 feet of stream length shall be used.

(iv)       Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition Sections.

(i)         If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that:

(i)         There are no practicable alternatives to the  activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected.

(ii)        The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:

a.         The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-Section, slope and sinuosity.

b.         Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion.

c.         One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible.  Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation.

d.         Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel.

e.         Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope of no steeper than 4:l horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.  Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred method for bank stabilization.  Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabion, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.

f.          All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction.  Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover.

g.         If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be pro-vided in the new channel.  Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established where appropriate.

h.         The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 26-304.

(j)         Seeding and Stabilization Plan.  For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.

(k)        Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Measures.  For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion, and sedimentation, control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:

(i)         The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible.  Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected.  In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements.

(ii)        Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible.  As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.

(iii)       Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or  filling is initiated on the site to prevent  the movement of eroded sediments off-site or into the channel.  Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment basins.

(iv)       A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or re- established, where possible, along exiting channels (see Section 26-304(B)(2)(p).  Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized.  Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion.  Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately.

(v)        Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control" (EPA, 1987).

(l)         Public Flood Control Projects.  For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this Section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to DWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.

(m)       General Criteria for Analysis of Flood Elevations. 

(i)         The flood profiles, flows, and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in Section 26-302, must be used for analysis of the base conditions.  If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, DWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.

(ii)        If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this Section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.

(iii)       If the applicant learns from DWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this Section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built.

(n)        Conditional Letter of Map Revision.  If the Appropriate Use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to DWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from DWR a conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued.  However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by DWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA and DWR.  In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before DWR approval can be given.  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued.  No further development activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA and DWR.

(o)        Professional Engineer's Supervision.  All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.

(p)        For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:

(i)         A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 

(ii)        Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an Appropriate Use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction.

(iii)       The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip.  Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream maintenance purposes.

(q)        After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an Appropriate Use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received.  The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.

(3)        State Review.  For those projects listed below located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:

(a)        DWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to Section 26-304(B)(2)(d).

(b)        DWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis shall indicate the proposed flood profile, pursuant to Section 26-304(B)(2)(e).

(c)        The DWR will review alternative transition Sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to Section 26-304(B)(2)(a), (b), and (h).

(d)        The DWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any Department projects, dams (as defined in Section 26-103), and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the municipality or county.

(4)        Other Permits.  In addition to the other requirements of this Chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.  No permit from DWR shall be required if the Division has delegated this responsibility to the Village.

(5)        Dam Safety Permits.  Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in Section 26-103 per 92 Ill.Adm.Code 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an Illinois Division of Water Resources Dam Safety permit prior to the start of construction of a dam.  If the Village Engineer finds a dam that does not have a DWR permit, he/she shall immediately notify the Dam Safety Section of the Division of Water Resources.  If the Village Engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, he/she shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, DWR, Dam Safety Section in Springfield, and the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA).

(6)        Activities that do not require a registered professional engineer's review.  The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review.  Such activities shall still meet the other requirement of this Chapter, including the mitigation requirements.

(a)        Underground and overhead utilities that:

(i)         Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or

(ii)        Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the floodway, or

(iii)       In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of 3 feet below the existing stream bed, and

(iv)       In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris.

(b)        Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:

(i)         Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope, and

(ii)        Do not result in an increase in ground elevation, and

(iii)       Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall location.

(c)        Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.

(d)        Construction of shoreline and streambank protection that:

(ii)        Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.

(iii)       Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake.

(iv)       Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems.  Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials.  Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble, and gabions should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.

(e)        Temporary stream crossings in which:

(i)         The approach roads will be 0.5 feet (l/2-foot) or less above natural grade.

(iii)       The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at lest 2 feet below the top of the lowest bank.  All fill in the channel shall be non-erosive materials, such as riprap or gravel.

(iv)       All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of the crossing.

(v)        The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization.

Sec. 26-305.    Occupation and Use of SFHA Areas where Floodways Are Not Identified.[back to top]

In SFHA or floodplains, where no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.

(A)       Development Permit.  No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall commence any development in a SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the Village Engineer.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Village Engineer.  The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions;  and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect, or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation at the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of Section 26-306 of this Chapter.

(1)        The application for a development permit shall also include the following information:

(a)        A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and intended use.

(b)        Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area.

(c)        Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity.

(d)        Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum:

(i)         A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale, and north arrow.

(ii)        A plan review of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum or N.G.V.D., adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, floodplain limit, location and orientation of crosssections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale.

(iii)       Cross-section view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevations, 10-year frequency flood elevation,  100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical).

(e)        Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of Section 26-305(B).

(f)         Any and all other local, state and federal permits or approval that may be required for this type of development.

(2)        Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository, the Village Engineer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to Section 26-302.  Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map Identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of this Chapter.  The Building Department shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate map identification.

(3)        The Village Engineer shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity.  The Village Engineer shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state, and federal permits have been obtained.

(B)       Preventing Increased Damages. No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocities or threat to public health, safety, and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel.

(1)        Within all riverine SFHA's where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply:

(a)        The developer shall have a Registered Professional Engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations, and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of Section 26-304(B) (2) for the entire floodplain, as calculated under the provisions of Section 26-302(D) of this Chapter.  As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to DWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway.  Upon acceptance of their floodway by the Department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of Section 26-304 for the regulatory floodway.  The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in Section 2-106(B) of this Chapter.

(b)        A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from DWR or written documentation that a permit is not required from DWR.

(c)        No permit from DWR shall be required if the Division has delegated permit responsibility to the Village per 92 Ill. Adm. Code, Part 708 for regulatory floodways, per DWR Statewide Permit entitled "Construction in Floodplains with No Designated Floodways in Northeastern Illinois."

(d)        Dam Safety Permits.  Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water as defined in Section 26103(B) shall obtain an Illinois Division of Water Resources Dam Safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not required prior to the start of construction of a dam.  If the Village Engineer finds a dam that does not have a DWR permit, he shall immediately notify the Dam Safety Section of the Division of Water Resources.  If the Village Engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, he shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA), and the DWR, Dam Safety Section in Springfield. 

(e)        The following activities may be permitted without a Registered Professional Engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory floodway.  Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this Chapter:

(i)         Underground and overhead utilities that:

a.         Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or

b.         Do not require the placement of above-ground structures in the floodway, or

c.         In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of 3 feet below the existing streambed, and

d.         In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris.

(ii)        Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:

a.         Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope.

b.         Do not result in an increase in ground elevation.

c.         Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the outfall location.

(iii)       Construction of shoreline and streambed protection that:

a.         Does not exceed l,000 feet in length or 2 cubic yards per lineal foot of streambed.

b.         Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.

c.         Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel by more than 10 percent.

d.         Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems.  Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials.  Artificial materials, such as concrete, construction rubble, and gabions should be avoids unless there are no practical alternatives.

(iv)       Temporary stream crossings in which:

a.         The approach will be 0.5 feet (l/2 foot) or less above natural grade.

b.         The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall invert.

c.         The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least 2 feet below the top of the lowest bank.  Any fill in the channel shall be non-erosive materials, such as riprap or gravel.

d.         All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction.

e.         The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization.

(v)        The construction of light poles, sign posts, and similar structures.

(vi)       The construction of sidewalks, drive-ways, athletic fields (excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at grade.

(vii)      The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures such as playground equipment, pavilions, and carports built at or below existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of flood waters.

(viii)      The placement of properly anchored buildings not exceeding 70 square feet in size nor 10 feet in any one dimension (e.g., animal shelters and tool sheds).

(ix)       The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not increase the first floor area by more than 20 percent, which are located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and which do not extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow of flood waters.

(x)        Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:

a.         The affected length of stream is less than l,000 feet.

b.         The work is confined to re-establishing flows in natural stream channels.

c.         The cross-sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site.

(f)         The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained.

(2)        Compensatory Storage.  Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.  The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one half (1-1/2) times the volume of storage that is lost due to the fill or structure.  In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.  All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.  All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.  All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

Sec. 26-306.    Permitting Requirements Applicable to all Flood Plain Areas.[back to top]

In addition to the requirements found in Sections 26-303,  26-304, and 26-305 for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways, and SFHA or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (Zones A, AO, AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M, or E), the following requirements shall be met:

(A)       Public Health Standards

(1)        No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE.

(B)       Carrying Capacity and Notification. For all projects involving channel modifications, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the water course shall be maintained.  In addition, the Village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 day prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.

(C)       Protecting Buildings. All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain, also known as a SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation.  However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive Appropriate Use Standards included in Section 26-304. 

(1)        The building criteria apply to the following situations:

(a)        Construction or placement of a new building.

(b)        A structural alteration to an existing building that either increases the first floor area by more than 20 percent or the building's market value by more than 50 percent.

(c)        Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site.  This building protection requirement does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage.

(d)        Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days.

(2)        This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods.

(a)        A residential or non-residential building, when allowed, may be constructed on permanent landfill in accordance with the following:

(i)         The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation.

(ii)        The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than l-foot deep before compaction and should extend at least 10 feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation.  The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation.  However, the 10-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures.  The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour.  The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.

(b)        A residential or non-residential building may be elevated in accordance with the following: 

(i)         The building or improvement shall be elevated on crawl space, stilts, piles, walls, or other foundation that is permanently open to flood waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood.  The permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above grade, and consist of a minimum of two openings.  The openings must have a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the Base Flood Elevation.

(ii)        The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice, and floating debris.

(iii)       All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage.  The lowest floor (including basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located at or above the flood protection elevation.  Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps, and other water-proofed service facilities may be located below the flood protection elevation.

(iv)       No area below the flood protection elevation  shall be used for storage of items or materials.

(v)        Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than 180 days shall be elevated to or above the flood protection elevation and shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act issued pursuant to 77 Ill. Adm. Code 870.

(c)        Only a non-residential building may be structurally floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that a registered professional engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood.  The building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice.  Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity (levees, berms, floodwalls, and similar works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection).

(d)        Non-conforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered.  A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or man-made disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50 percent of its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this Chapter.

(3)        Detached garages of single-family homes may be "wet- proofed" provided that all of the following conditions apply:

(a)        The garages are not located in the floodway.

(b)        The garages are only used for the storage of vehicles and tools.

(c)        The garages are not habitable and do not contain other rooms or uses (such as a shop, greenhouse, bedroom, etc.

(d)        All the utilities are above the base flood elevation.

(e)        All the materials that are located below the base flood elevation are flood-resistant.

(f)         The garages cover less than 500 square feet of land.

Sec. 26-307.    Other Development Requirements.[back to top]

The Board of Trustees shall take into account flood hazards to the extent that they are known in all official actions related to land management, use, and development.

(A)       New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements, and Planned Unit Developments (PUD's) within the SFHA shall be reviewed to assure that the proposed developments are consistent with Sections 26-303, 26-304, 26-305, and 26-306 of this Chapter and the need to minimize flood damage.  Plats or plans for new subdivisions, mobile home parks, and PUD's shall include a signed statement by a Registered Professional Engineer that the plat or plans account for changes in the drainage of surface waters in accordance with the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/2).

(B)       Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, travel trailer parks, and PUD's additions to manufactured home parks, and additions to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation data and floodway delineations.  Where this information is not available from an existing study filed with the Illinois State Water Survey, the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation per Section 26-302(D) and the floodway delineation per the definition in Section 26-103(B) and submitting it to the State Water Survey and DWR for review and approval as best available regulatory data.

(C)       Street, blocks, lots, parks, and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and channels.  Wherever possible, the floodplains shall be included within parks or other public grounds.

(D)       The Board of Trustees shall not approve any PUD or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.

Article 4.  Administration and Enforcement.

Sec. 26-401.    Responsibility.  [back to top]

The administration and enforcement of this Chapter shall be the responsibility of the Village Engineer.

Sec. 26-402.    Appeals.  [back to top]

An appeal may be taken to the Board by any person aggrieved by an administrative order, requirement, decision, or determination under this Chapter by the Village Engineer.

Sec. 26-403.    Exemption; Payment Option for Areas Not Located in SFHA'S.  [back to top]

This Section may provide the developer with an alternative to physically providing for detention storage of excess storm water runoff for the development or improvement.  The owner or other person proposing development in certain situations shall have the option of paying to the Village cash funds in lieu of complying with the provisions that require physical detention storage to storm water.  The cash funds shall be in an amount that is substantially equal to the estimated cost to the Village for providing an alternate means of storm water detention storage that is substantially equivalent to the increased amount of storm water runoff that will result from the proposed development, as determined by the Village Engineer.  Calculations of such increased amount of storm water runoff shall be made on the basis of (and expressed in terms of) an acre-foot of volume, or a fraction thereof.  All funds paid to the Village under this Section shall be segregated, held, and disbursed only to pay the costs of such additional storm water detention storage facilities as the Village deems appropriate.

This section further provides the developer with an alternative to physically providing for water quality BMP for the development or improvement as those presented in Appendix E of the County Ordinance, Part I-Technical Guidance, Water Quality Best Management Practices. All funds paid to the Village under this paragraph shall be separately segregated, held, and disbursed only to pay the costs of the design, construction and maintenance of BMP as the Village deems appropriate.”

(A)       The "Exemption:  Payment Option" will not apply if the area of the proposed development is within a Special Flood Hazard Area.

(B)       The "Exemption:  Payment Option" will only be permitted if the developer and his engineer can substantiate hardship in complying with the detention storage provisions of Article 2.  The Mayor and Board of Trustees shall only recognize a hardship if, upon evidence presented to them, they conclude the following:

(1)        The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the provisions of Article 2 otherwise applicable.

(2)        Failure to grant the "Exemption:  Payment Option" would constitute a hardship to the owner which has not resulted from actions of the owner.

(3)        The requested "Exemption:  Payment Option" has a beneficial purpose and is otherwise lawful.

(4)        The requested "Exemption:  Payment Option" will have no materially adverse effect upon efficiency of water flow capacity or water detention storage capacity of any floodway or floodplain, as determined by the Village Engineer.

(5)        The requested "Exemption:  Payment Option" will not materially increase the probability of potential flood damage either to the subject property or to other properties, as determined by the Village Engineer.

(6)        The requested "Exemption:  Payment Option" will not alter the essential character of the vicinity.

(C)       The payment rate due from an owner-developer for the "Exemption:  Payment Option" shall be calculated at the rate of $115,000 per acre-foot of exemption detention storage.  The exemption detention storage volume shall be equal to 100 percent of the detention storage volume required per Article 2.  This $115,000.00 per acre-foot of exemption detention storage volume has been calculated by the Village Engineer to be sufficient to compensate the Village for total expenses in providing detention storage in another location as of March 1, 1999.  The rate for a fractional acre-foot of exemption detention storage shall be prorated as appropriate.

From time to time, as frequently as the Village Board may deem it necessary or desirable, the Village Board shall determine and establish  the cost to the Village of providing one acre-foot of storm water exemption detention storage, such cost to include, without limitation, the cost of necessary land acquisition, engineering expenses, legal fees, and other related expenditures.  The amount so determined and established shall serve as the basis for the calculation of the cash funds to be paid as provided in this Section until such time as a different amount is determined and established by the Village Board.

(D)       The owner-developer shall be exempt from the storm water detention storage requirement according to Article 2 providing that:

(1)        The owner-developer has procured the written approval of the Village Engineer for lots less than or equal to one acre in size or the Village Engineer and the Mayor and Board of Trustees for lots greater than one acre in size, acknowledging that all of the requirements of this Section have been complied with.

(2)        The owner-developer has made cash payment to the Village for the amount of detention storage volume exempted and the payment made at the established dollar rate per acre-foot of volume.

(3)        For lots greater than one acre in size, such exemption shall be made by a certificate signed by the Mayor with the approval of the Board of Trustees.

(E)       The payment rate due from an owner-developer for the “Exemption: Payment Option for water quality BMP” shall be calculated as follows:

Single or two family residential land uses                                    $  3,000 per acre

Multiple family or non-residential land uses                                $15,000 per acre

Roadway Developments                                                           $30,000 per acre

Religious institutions defined under Sec. 15-10 of
                the Illinois Property Tax Code and governmental
                entities not to include roadways and parking lots                    $  3,000 per acre

 

(Ord. 99-65; 08-60)

Sec. 26-404.    Variances.  [back to top]

The Board may grant variances from the regulatory standards of this Chapter in accordance with the following requirements:  The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only.  The Board, after examining the applicant's hardships, shall approve or disapprove a request.  While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre, deviations from that limitation may occur.  However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may review a community's findings justifying the granting of variances, and if that review indicates a pattern inconsistent with the objectives of sound floodplain management, FEMA may take appropriate action.  Variances may be issued by the Board for reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this Section.  Procedures for the granting of variances are as follows:

(A)       Variances shall not be issued if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(B)       Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level in conformance with the procedures of this Section. 

(C)       Variances shall only be issued upon (1) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (2) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, (3) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or  ordinances, (4)  Development activity cannot be located outside of the special flood hazard area, and (5) the provisions of Sections 26-303(B) and 5.305(B) can still be met.

(D)       Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(E)       The Village Engineer shall notify the applicant in writing that (a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverages, and (b) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in this Section.

(F)       The Board shall (a) maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and (b) report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to FEMA.

Article 5.  Savings Clauses.

Sec. 26-501.    Separability.  [back to top]

If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Chapter shall not be affected thereby.

Sec. 26-502.    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  [back to top]

It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this Chapter shall prevail.  This Chapter is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program  regulations,  but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the Village passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program.

Sec. 26-503.    Disclaimer of Liability.  [back to top]

The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records, engineering, and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the prescribed floodplain boundaries or land uses permitted with such floodplains will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Addison or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages which may result from reliance on this Chapter or on any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Sec. 26-504.    Judicial Appeals.  [back to top]

Any party shall have the right to appeal decisions of the Village of Addison before the Circuit Court of DuPage County. 

Article 6.  Penalties for Violation.

Sec. 26-601.    General.  [back to top]

Violation of the provisions of this Chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with variances or special use permits shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $500.00, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

Sec. 26-602.    Corrective Actions.  [back to top]

Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of Addison from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. All such costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. The Village Engineer shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.

APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND APPROVAL PROCESS
A. PRE-APPLICATION MEETINGS
1. Informal Meeting: Before any land is Subdivided or Resubdivided, the owner of the
property, or an authorized agent, may request a meeting with the Director of
Community Development to gain their advice. In so doing, both the owner and the
Director of Community Development can reach mutual conclusions regarding the
general concept and objectives of the proposed development and possible effects on
the neighborhood and the community.
Generally, if an owner or agent chooses to participate in an informal meeting, the
following procedures may be followed:
a. Applicant: Submit five (5) copies of a Concept Plan to the Director of
Community Development.
b. Community Development Department: If the Concept Plan is so incomplete
as to be meaningless, the Director of Community Development may refuse to
accept it. Upon acceptance of a Concept Plan, a date and time for the
Informal Meeting may be scheduled; or, the applicant may be referred to the
Development Review Committee; or, the applicant may be referred to the
Plan Commission.
2. Development Review Committee (D.R.C.): A meeting with the Village's D.R.C.
may be conducted at the discretion of the Director of Community Development or
upon a request from the applicant. The D.R.C. consists of Village Department
Heads, Fire Protection District, Park District representatives, and the Village
Attorney.
Generally at this meeting, the proposed development is discussed in a conceptual
nature, and is a listening session to understand what the applicant's request is, and
whether it is what the Village is looking for. The applicant is advised of existing
utilities within the vicinity of the property, and what public improvements may be
needed to accomplish the proposed development.
Procedures for a meeting with the Village's D.R.C. are as follows:
a. Applicant: Submit ten (10) copies of a Concept Plan to the Director of
Community Development at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting at
which it is to be reviewed.

meeting may be scheduled.
c. D.R.C.: Evaluate the applicant’s submission, and presentation. Discuss the
Concept Plan with the applicant. Upon completion of the meeting, the
applicant may be advised of the general scheduling of future meetings,
reviews, and administrative procedures to finalize the development.
d. Recommendations: Any changes requested at the D.R.C. meeting are to be
made to the Concept Plan, and resubmitted to the Director of Community
Development. Once the Director of Community Development feels
sufficient material has been submitted, and the Concept Plan is in compliance
with the Village's requirements, the Director of Community Development
may recommend the submission of a preliminary plan to the Plan
Commission.
Recommendations made during a pre-application meeting are advisory only for mutual
benefit, and do not require a formal application or fee.
B. SUBDIVISION CLASSIFICATION
During the informal meetings, or upon formal submission, a subdivision shall be classified as
a minor subdivision, or as a major subdivision. The procedures contained in this Ordinance
provide for a three (3) step process in the review of a minor subdivision, and a five (5) step
process in the review of a major subdivision.
1. Minor Subdivision: The purpose of a minor subdivision is to simplify the
preparation, and expedite the processing of the plats for a minor subdivision. No
preliminary plan, or engineering plans are required to be submitted for a minor
subdivision, but it is suggested, that the subdivider consult with the Director of
Community Development prior to the preparation of the final plat.
The three (3) steps consist of:
a. Final Plat Approval (Plan Commission):
b. Final Plat Approval (Village Board)
c. Recording of the Final Plat
2. Major Subdivision:
The five (5) steps consist of:
23
a. Pre-platting Conference (Plan Commission):
b. Preliminary Plan Approval (Plan Commission):
c. Preliminary Plan Approval (Village Board)
d. Final Plat Approval (Village Board)
e. Recording of the Final Plat
C. PLAN COMMISSION
1. In order to provide an orderly basis for the processing of subdivision plats prior to
approval; the Plan Commission shall consider such plats in two stages, as follows:
a. Preliminary Plan to be submitted with application and engineering plans for
preliminary approval.
b. Final Plat for recording of all or part of a subdivision, to be submitted with
the required supporting data and documents together with an application and
engineering plans for final approval.
The formal, step-by-step procedure for approval of a Preliminary Plan and Final Plat
is established in Articles VIII and IX respectively.
2. The Plan Commission, in examination of a subdivision, resubdivision or
consolidation plat for approval, shall take into consideration the requirements of the
community and the best use of the land being subdivided or resubdivided. Particular
attention will be given to width and location of streets, suitable sanitary utilities,
surface drainage, lot sizes and arrangements as well as local requirements for parks,
streets, schools, recreation sites and/or other public uses.
3. The Plan Commission shall not recommend for approval any plat of subdivision,
resubdivision, or consolidation of land which does not make adequate provision for
storm or flood water run-off channels, basins or sewers.
4. In all subdivisions, resubdivisions, or consolidations, due regard shall be given to the
preservation of natural features such as large trees, water courses, historical and
similar features.
5. In cases of Preliminary Plans for parts of tracts, where it appears necessary to the
Plan Commission for the satisfactory over-all development of an area, an owner may
be required to prepare a plan of utilities and streets for his entire tract based upon
proper topographic surveys before approval of any portion of such plat is rendered.
24
6. Any meeting of the Plan Commission shall be part of a regularly scheduled meeting,
shall be open to the public, and on the agenda in advance of the meeting.
D. VILLAGE BOARD
The Mayor and Board of Trustees, upon review and recommendation by the Plan

to the proper classification for such intended use in accordance with the applicable
Zoning Ordinance.
7. Village Board: After a recommendation on the preliminary plan by the Plan
Commission, the preliminary plan shall be submitted to the Village Board for their
34
action. Having satisfied itself that the preliminary plan is substantially in accordance
with the requirements set forth in this Ordinance, and that the Plan Commission has
inspected all phases of the improvement, the Village Board shall approve or
disapprove the preliminary plan. Approval of a preliminary plan by the Plan
Commission, and the Village Board shall not constitute acceptance of the plan of the
proposed subdivision, but shall be deemed only as an expression of approval of the
plan submitted, and shall act as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, which
final plat will be submitted for approval to the Village Board and for recording upon
fulfillment of the requirements of this Ordinance.
Upon disapproval of a preliminary plan, the Village Board shall return the plan to the
applicant with a written statement setting forth the reasons for said disapproval. Once
deficiencies are corrected the applicant may resubmit the preliminary plan for
consideration in accordance with procedures set forth in the Ordinance without filing

the original plan shall be endorsed by the Plan Commission as follows:
THIS PROPOSED PRELIMINARY PLAN AND ACCOMPANYING
DOCUMENTS, HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE PLAN COMMISSION OF
THE VILLAGE OF ADDISON, AND SAID PLAN COMMISSION IS NOW
READY TO RECEIVE THE FINAL PLAT FOR CONSIDERATION.
The original of the preliminary plan so endorsed shall remain on file with the
Department of Community Development. A copy of the plan so endorsed shall be
returned to the applicant.
If the proposed subdivision should lie wholly or partly outside the corporate limits of
the Village, the Village Board's action on the preliminary plan shall not be final until
the Board of Supervisors of DuPage County has approved it.
8. Effective Date of Preliminary Approval: Approval of a preliminary plan shall be
effective for a maximum period of one (1) year unless; upon application by the
subdivider, the Plan Commission grants an extension; or, within this time period,
approval of a final plat applying to only a portion of the area covered in the
preliminary plan shall automatically extend the effective period of the preliminary
approval for a period of one (1) year from the date of approval of such final plat.
The same automatic extension shall govern in subsequent cases of submission of a
final plat for part of the subdivision; provided further, that at any time after the initial
one (1) year period during which the preliminary plan approval is effective, the Plan
Commission may notify the subdivider of changes it will require to meet new or
changed conditions. If the final plat has not been submitted to the plan commission
within this time limit, the applicant shall submit a new application, fee, and
preliminary plan to the Plan Commission for approval.
35
9. Authority to Proceed with Final Plat: Receipt by the applicant of a copy of the
preliminary plan together with the approval of the Plan Commission, Village Board
and County, when required, shall constitute authority for the applicant to proceed
with final plans and specifications for the installation of the required improvements
and preparation of the final plat. Prior to construction of any required improvements,
the applicant shall submit such final plans and specifications, along with the final
plat to the Village. No construction shall commence until the requirements of Article

J. INSPECTION
All required public improvements and on-site amenities to be installed under this Ordinance
shall be inspected both during the course of construction and after construction is completed,
by the Village Engineer and / or other qualified and authorized employees of the Village.
The Village Engineer shall have authority over construction, materials, methods of
construction and workmanship to insure compliance with this Ordinance and the Plans. The
developer shall provide for reasonable tests and proof of quality of materials as reasonably
requested by the Village Engineer. The Village Engineer may require that work be
suspended for due cause which shall include adverse weather conditions, questionable
materials or methods of construction or workmanship, or failure to adhere to this Ordinance
or the Plans.
It shall be the responsibility of the developer and / or the general contractor, to notify the
Village of Addison’s Engineering Division, forty eight (48) hours in advance of commencing
any work to request a list of the required inspections. A request for any required inspection
must be received by the Engineering Division twenty four (24) hours in advance of the time

Failure of any Village employee, inspector, agent or official to detect construction work or
materials which fail to meet the requirements of this Ordinance and Plans, or either of them,
shall in no way relieve the developer of full responsibility for complying to, and adherence
by all contractors and material suppliers to this Ordinance and the Plans, nor for failure to
adhere to high standards of materials, methods and workmanship.
K. PROTECTION AND REPAIR OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
The developer, its contractors and material suppliers shall be responsible for protecting the
public improvements against damage resulting from their construction activities and assuring
the Village that the public improvements and the property of the Village are not damaged or
rendered less useful or unsightly as a result of the construction activities. This provision is
intended to include any and all damages to, and any nuisance created upon public land,
48
public improvements and landscaping of the Village or other government entities and public
agencies.
To reduce or localize the possibility of damage to streets by heavy trucks, the developer shall
instruct its contractors and material suppliers to follow instructions of the Village Engineer
as to which streets may be used for access to the site by their equipment and trucks. The
developer shall be responsible for the enforcement of such instructions.
The Village may draw upon the Damage and Nuisance Guarantee (Article XVIII.C.) to pay
for any expenses that have been or may be incurred by the Village for cleaning of streets,
catch basins and sewers, regarding drainage swales, repair or replacement of landscaping,
and repairing any damage to its Public Improvements.
L. ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
If any plat of subdivision contains public streets or easements which are dedicated on the
plat, whether located within the corporate limits of the Village or in part outside of the
corporate limits, or contains existing streets located outside of the corporate limits, approval
of the final plat by the Board of Trustees or subsequent annexation of the property to the
Village, shall not constitute an acceptance by the Village of the streets, easements, or the
Public Improvements constructed or installed within the public streets or easements, nor of
the Public Improvements constructed or installed thereon or therein irrespective of any act or
acts by any officer, agent or employee of the Village with respect to such streets or
improvements.
Acceptance of Public Improvement(s) shall be contingent upon the following conditions
being satisfied:
1. Final Inspection: When all, or an individual Public Improvement is completed in
their entirety, the developer shall formally request the Village Engineer, in writing,
to certify the completion (Certificate Of Completion) of all or the individual Public
Improvement. Upon receipt of the Letter Of Request, the Village Engineer, in
conjunction with the Director of Public Works and the Director of Environmental
Services, will schedule a Final Inspection to take place as soon as reasonably
possible after receipt of the Letter Of Request.
Due to the inability to determine whether parkway trees are living during the winter
months, and the inability to conduct certain other inspections when snow is on the
ground, the Village Engineer will not certify completion or recommend acceptance
by the Village Board between November 1 and June 1.
All deficient improvements which do not totally conform to this Ordinance or the
Plans, will be put on a written punch list (the “Construction Punch List”). The
Construction Punch List will be forwarded to the developer for corrective action.
49
When the developer has corrected all deficiencies noted on the Construction Punch
List, the developer shall request a second final inspection. Scheduling a second final
inspection shall be the same as for the initial final inspection. If the length of time
between the initial final inspection and the second final inspection is greater that
twelve (12) months, or if the noted deficiencies in the Construction Punch List have
not been corrected at the time the second final inspection is made, the request for
Certification Of Completion may be cancelled by the Village Engineer. If canceled,
a second request letter will be required, and said certification will be subject to the
following additional requirements:
a. The developer shall be required to pay the costs incurred by all persons
conducting the reinspection, including, but not limited to, Village staff.
b. The Construction Punch List developed during the initial final inspection will
be voided, and a complete re-inspection will be required, and a new
Construction Punch List prepared.
2. Certification Of Completion: Such certification by the Village Engineer shall be
made upon satisfactory completion of all, or individual Public Improvements
constructed and installed in accordance with the applicable plans and specifications.
3. Waiver of Lien: To assure protection against any mechanic’s lien claims, through
the Completion Date, the developer shall furnish the Village Engineer with a sworn
contractor’s statement from each prime contractor with whom it contracted for the
construction, installation, repair or maintenance, and a final waiver of lien from
every person and entity that furnished labor and / or material in connection with the
public improvements, including final waivers from all subcontractors and material
suppliers shown on the first tier of the subcontractor’s waiver.
4. Test Reports: Where required by this Ordinance, or deemed necessary by the Village
Engineer, test reports indicating compliance with this Ordinance and the Plans have
been furnished to the Village Engineer.
5. Bill of Sale: A Bill of Sale, in the form approved by the Village Attorney,
transferring title of the Public Improvements to the Village, shall have been delivered
to the Village Engineer.
6. Record Drawings: One (1) reproducible mylar set, and two (2) sets of paper prints of
the Record Drawings shall be submitted to the Village Engineer. The Record
Drawing shall include service location information for the sanitary and water
services for each lot, and an accurate representation of all above ground and under
ground improvements. The Record Drawings shall reflect all field changes regarding
location and elevation for the improvements. (Section 102)
50
7. Maintenance Guarantee: The developer shall post adequate security to guarantee the
maintenance of the Public Improvements and every component part of the Public
Improvements in an acceptable condition for the Maintenance Period and to
guarantee payment for all maintenance work. (Article XVIII.D.)
8. Completion Date: Once the Village Engineer has certified that all, or an individual
Public Improvement, required to be constructed by this Ordinance, has been fully, or
individually completed, a Completion Date shall be established. This date (the
“Completion Date”) shall be the first day of the next month following the date noted
on the Certification Of Completion.
The acceptance of Public Improvements shall be made only by the adoption of a Resolution
by the Board of Trustees after there has been filed with the Plan Commission a Certification
Of Completion by the Village Engineer stating that all, or an individual Public Improvement,
required to be constructed by this Ordinance, has been fully, or individually completed, and
that the inspected construction or installation has been approved by the Village Engineer.
The sub-grade, sub-base, base course and surface course of a street, thoroughfare, alley or
parking area shall be collectively considered as a single, or individual Public Improvement.
Acceptance by the Village Board of an individual Public Improvement shall constitute
release of that applicable portion of the Performance Guaranty.
M. RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE
The developer shall be responsible for the protection, maintenance and repair of all the
Public Improvements for the Maintenance Period, and for the payment of all costs associated
therewith.
The Village shall not be liable for any damages that may occur on any dedicated roadway
within a new subdivision, resubdivision or PUD, that has not been accepted by adoption of a
Resolution by the Village Board of Trustees. The developer, its agents and employees shall
indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Village from and against any and all claims that
may be submitted.
In the event that any Public Improvement is damaged, the burden shall be on the developer
to show that the damage was not caused by the developer, its agents, servants, employees,
successors or assigns, or by any contractor hired by the developer, its agents, servants,
employees, successors or assigns, or any subcontractor hired by such contractor.
1. Protection: The developer shall be responsible for protecting the Public
Improvements from any damage resulting from construction activities.
2. Maintenance: The developers maintenance obligations shall include, but are not
limited to:
51
a. Maintaining the Public Improvements; and

c. Repairing or replacing any defective workmanship or materials in the Public
Improvements; and
d. Making good and protecting the Village against the results of any defective
workmanship or materials incorporated in any part of the Public
Improvements which appear or are discovered during the Maintenance
Period; and
e. Keeping streets clear of ice and snow. If the developer fails to clear ice and
snow from the street within six (6) hours of any snowfall, such failure shall
be considered a violation of the provisions of this Article. If there are any
Certificates of Occupancy on the street, and the developer is in violation of
this Article, the Village may on six (6) hours notice clear the street of ice and
snow, charging twice those costs to the developer.
f. Paying the cost for all such maintenance work.
3. Village Responsibilities: During the Maintenance Period, the Village will provide its
customary:
a. Street sweeping, but only after all construction activity has been completed,
and the developer has presented the Village with a clean street.
b. Street snow plowing, but only if the surface course has been placed.
c. Enforcement of the Village’s Vehicle Code, but only if the developer has
installed regulatory traffic signs.
All other maintenance of the Public Improvements shall be performed by the developer.
N. MAINTENANCE PERIOD
The Maintenance Period shall commence on the Completion Date as certified by the Village
Engineer, and will continue for a minimum of twelve (12) months and a maximum of
twenty (20) months. The length of the Maintenance Period shall be established by the
Village Engineer, so that the expiration date of the Maintenance Period will occur between
June 1 and November 1. This schedule eliminates an expiration date during the winter
months, and allows inspection and repairs to be made during favorable weather conditions.
Under no circumstances shall a Maintenance Period end between November 1 and June 1.
52
A Maintenance Guaranty shall in all cases be for twenty four (24) months. Approximately
ninety (90) days before the expiration date of the Maintenance Period, the Village Engineer,
Director of Public Works and the Director of Environmental Services, or their designees,
shall conduct a Maintenance Inspection. In the event that the inspection reveals any
deficiencies in the Public Improvements, they shall be inventoried and placed on a
Maintenance Punch List which the Village Engineer will forward to the developer for
corrective action. The developer shall have forty five (45) days from the date of the
Maintenance Punch List, to correct all items. Upon notification from the developer that all
items have been corrected, a final maintenance inspection conducted prior to the expiration
date of the Maintenance Period, shall be performed to determine compliance. In the event
that there remain any uncorrected deficiencies or any new deficiencies are discovered, the
Village Engineer shall prepare another written estimate of cost to correct these deficiencies.
Within thirty (30) days of the end of the Maintenance Period, the developer shall furnish to
the Village Engineer a general contractor’s sworn statement from each contractor that
performed any of the maintenance work, and final waivers of lien form all persons that
furnished labor and / or materials in connection with the maintenance work. In the event the
Developer does not correct the deficiencies in the punch list, and / or there are missing
waivers, the Village Engineer shall prepare a cost estimate. This estimate of cost shall be in
an amount sufficient to correct the deficiencies, include engineering, legal and other
expenses to cover the cost of preparing specifications, bid documents (if applicable) and
contract(s) to perform such corrective work, and to cover any potential lien claims based on
missing waivers of lien. Upon completion of the estimate of cost, the Village Engineer shall:
1. Deliver a notice to the surety demanding performance of its obligations under the
Maintenance Guaranty; and
2. Deliver a site draft to the issuer of the Maintenance Guaranty, all before the
expiration of the Maintenance Guaranty; or
3. Deduct this amount from a cash bond.
O. BUILDING FOR HABITATION
No building for habitation shall be erected on any lot or parcel of land within the Village,
and no building permit shall be issued with respect thereto unless a highway, road, street or
public right-of-way for public service facilities, watermains, sanitary and storm sewers are
provided to serve said lot or parcel of land in the manner and in accordance with the
“Standard Specifications For Design And Construction” as set forth in this Ordinance, except
that building permits may be issued for habitable construction on all existing private roads,
when such permit is accompanied by properly recorded easements in lieu of public right-ofway
dedication, and for habitable construction on private roads as permitted in planned
developments.
53
P. FAILURE TO COMPLETE PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
When a developer fails to complete the public improvements in a:
1. Good and workman like manner; or
2. Fails to use materials of good quality in strict accordance with the engineering plans
and specifications; or
3. Fails to complete the public improvements in a timely manner;
The Director of Community Development shall declare the developer in default, and direct
the Village Engineer to prepare a cost estimate. This estimate of cost shall be in an amount
sufficient to replace, complete, or correct all outstanding issues with the public
improvements, including engineering, legal and other expenses to cover the cost of preparing
specifications, bid documents (if applicable) and contract (s) to perform such work, and to
cover any potential lien claims based on missing waivers of lien. Upon completion of the
estimate of cost, the Village Engineer shall:
1. Deliver a notice to the surety demanding performance of its obligations under the
Performance Guarantee; and
2. Deliver a site draft to the issuer of the Performance Guarantee, all before the
expiration of the Performance Guarantee; or
3. Deduct this amount from a cash bond.

1. Arrangement: Lots shall be laid out in an efficient and uniform manner to avoid the
creation of unusable remnants of land.
a. All lots shall abut on a publicly dedicated street for at least fifty (50) feet,
except in a Planned Unit Development, unless an approved modification is
granted by the Village Board.
b. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial to street lines.
c. Lots fronting on an arterial road should have access to a frontage road, or an
interior road.
d. A lot shall not be allowed to block any street extension which has been set
forth on the Official Map of the Village.
e. Lots or tracts laid out, or intended for business use, shall be adequate to
provide off-street service and parking facilities as required by the type of use
and development contemplated in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance of
the Village of Addison as amended.
60
2. Lot Sizes: Lot width and area shall conform to the requirements of the Village of
Addison's Zoning Ordinance. Corner lots shall be of sufficient size to provide for
building lines on each street frontage not less than the depth of the required front and
corner side yard specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
3. Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage lots are not permitted except where lots back
upon a Collector and or Arterial Street, and in such instances, vehicular access
between the lots and the thoroughfare is prohibited. Where topographic or other
conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable, such double frontage lots
shall have an additional depth of at least 20 feet in order to provide a protective
screen planting on one frontage.
4. Measurement of Irregularly Shaped lots: The width of irregularly shaped lots shall be
measured along a line drawn parallel to the front lot line at a distance from the front
lot line determined by the required building setback. In case of a curved front lot
line, the lot width shall be measured as the length of the arc which is parallel to the
front lot line at the building setback.
D. BLOCK STANDARDS
1. Block Lengths: A block shall be measured between street center lines. The
maximum length of a residential block shall be 1,500 feet, with a minimum length of
500 feet. These block lengths do not apply to industrial or commercial subdivisions.
Block lengths and widths shall be coordinated with the development of the land, and
shall be provided in a manner that will allow traffic flow and pedestrian use. The
Village Board may determine that a greater or shorter block lengths are required to
avoid or reduce a traffic hazard.
2. Street and Block Layout: All streets shall be arranged in accordance with the
standards detailed in this section.
a. Street and blocks shall be laid out in a clear, logical manner. Forked streets,
streets that double back on themselves, and streets that change direction shall
be avoided. The street pattern and building numbering system should enable
emergency vehicles to reach a destination quickly and without confusion.
b. A development of the so-called "Reston" type, with oversize irregular-shaped
blocks and access from the surrounding area via loop streets and containing
interior parks, playgrounds and school sites, will be acceptable when such
plans include adequate walks for pedestrian access from any lot within a
block to the interior park. Such developments shall provide space for, and
satisfactory access to, an elementary school site if such is needed and shall be
61
covered by acceptable agreements as to development and maintenance of the
public or joint-use areas.

improvements.
b. Written waiver of lien for all labor or materials provided for the public
improvements.
9. Retention: Upon completion of each eligible category of public improvement, the

ARTICLE XX
SCHOOL AND PARK DEDICATIONS
ORDINANCE 0-00-28
In the case of the development of land for residential uses, the Plan Commission will recommend
and the Village Board will require each Applicant to dedicate land for park and recreational
purposes and land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
parcel, to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or to provide a combination of
both at the option of the Village, with consultation with public bodies in accordance with the criteria
and formula. Such dedication is necessary to ensure proper provision of park and school sites for
persons who are expected to reside within the subdivision or development, which sites would
otherwise have to be acquired at the expense of the general public, but whose utility would generally
be limited to residents of the parcel.
It is the intent of this ordinance that upon annexation of a lot on which residential dwelling units
already exist and which is already in the park or school districts, that no donation for park or school
purposes will be required.
A. CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PARK AND LAND DEDICATION
Applications for new residential development will be required to dedicate for park and
recreation purposes an amount of land determined on the basis of 5.5 acres per thousand
persons calculated as provide in Exhibit A, “Table of Estimated Ultimate Population”.
1. Location: The location of the site to be dedicated will be determined by the Village
Board upon recommendation of the Plan Commission and the Addison Park District,
taking into account the suitability of the site for park purposes or development, its
relationship to population concentrations, and its proximity to other park or
recreational lands.
2. On Site Storage: No storage of any materials, including spoil materials or top soil
will be allowed on any land designated as Park District land for use as Recreational
Use or Land designated as future or proposed School sites.
B. CRITERIA FOR SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION
Applicants for approval of new residential developments may be required to dedicate for
school purposes an amount of land determined either by the following means or by such
similar means as are mutually agreed to.
1. Obtaining the ratio of estimated children to be generated by the proposed subdivision
68
or development within each school classification, calculated as provided in Exhibit
A, to the maximum number of children to be served within each school classification
calculated from the Table in this Section and by;
2. Multiplying that ratio by the minimum number of acres for a school site within each
school classification determined from the Table in this Section.
BASE SCHOOL POPULATION AND SITE SIZE
School Classification by
Grades
Maximum Number of Students
for each such School
Classification
Minimum Number Acres of
Land for each School Site of
such Classification
Elementary Schools, Grades -
Kindergarten thru 5th (K - 5)
600 Students 11 Acres
Junior High Schools, Grades
6th thru 8th (6 - 8)
900 Students 19 Acres
High Schools, Grades 9th thru
12th (9 - 12)
2,300 Students 48 Acres
C. CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF PARK AND SCHOOL
SITES
Where the resulting site in a proposed subdivision or development is too small to be usable
for the purpose intended or where it is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a
school site, the Village will require an Applicant to contribute cash in lieu of the land
dedication. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication will be held
in trust by the Village or other public body designated by the Village, solely for the
acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified, which will serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the
improvement of other existing park and recreation land which already serves such needs.
The cash contributions in lieu of school sites will be held by the Village, or other public
body designated by the Village, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to
serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for
the improvement to any existing school site which already serves such needs, including the
construction of any school buildings or additions thereto.
1. Fair Market Value: The cash contribution in lieu of land will be based on the “Fair
Market Value” of the acres of land as improved, that otherwise would have been
69
dedicated as park and recreation or school sites. It has been determined that the
present “Fair Market Value” of such improved land in and surrounding the Village is
$60,000.00 per acre and such figure will be used in making any calculation herein
unless the Applicant files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such
objection, the Applicant will submit an appraisal showing the “Fair Market Value”
per acre of such improved land, upon which a determination will be made by the
Village Board based upon the appraisal and such information from other sources
which may be submitted to the Village Board by the Park District, School District or
others.
D. CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING DEDICATION AND A FEE
There will be situations when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of
land are both necessary. The occasions will arise when:
1. The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the
dedication requirements hereunder. That portion of the land within the subdivision
or development which is adequate or sufficient for the park or school location will be
dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof will be
required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated.
2. A major part of the local park recreation site or school site has already been acquired
and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision or development to
complete the site. The portions needed to complete the park or school site will be
dedicated, and a cash contribution will be required in lieu of the balance of the
required dedication.
E. DENSITY FORMULA
The following table of population density (Exhibit A) is generally indicative of current and
short range projected trends in family size for new construction and will be used in
calculating
the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contribution in lieu thereof
unless a written objection is filed thereto by the Applicant. In the event an Applicant files a
written objection to Exhibit A, the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population listed herein, he
will submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population and in
that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations will be
made by the Village Board based upon such demographic information submitted by the
Applicant and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board by the Park
District, School District, or others.
F. IMPROVED SITE
The slope, topography and geology of the site to be dedicated as well as its surroundings
70
must be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and
recreational uses will not differ greatly from surrounding land. Before dedication, all sites
will be improved as required under this Chapter or acceptable provisions will be made for
such improvements before dedication.
1. The developer is to furnish a clear title and a Plat of Survey to the Addison Park
District.
2. All new developments which are being annexed to the Addison Park District are to
be annexed at the owner’s expense.
3. The entire site is to be fine graded to provide adequate storm water runoff.
Minimum surface grade of 1% is required. If less than 1%, developer is to provide
underground drain tile, storm sewers, and maintenance.
4. It is possible that certain sites to be dedicated may not have to be graded if existing
grade and turf is acceptable to the Park District.
5. The site is to contain a minimum of 4" of topsoil (6" preferred) throughout the entire
area of park land. If necessary, the Park District will require a clay cover on exposed
peat areas, with topsoil over-layment.
6. Developer to seed and fertilize all land to be dedicated as open space with Park
District approving all seeding specifications. All land must be cleared by the
developer of any debris and sizeable rocks prior to seeding. Developer will re-seed
any area that did not establish successful turf with first seeding.
7. Developer would provide at least 3 soil borings for each site to be dedicated as open
space.
8. Developer to provide a certified existing or as built topographical plat of entire site.
9. Developer to provide adequate sidewalks into site.
10. Upon completion of any necessary grading and seeding, the site is to be completed
with the installation of trees and shrubs placed strategically at all entrances to the
site.
11. To provide post and rail fence or other acceptable fence or buffer hedge bordering
residential areas.
G. TIMING OF DONATIONS
Except as otherwise approved by the corporate authorities of the Village, Park and School
71
Districts, donation of land or cash in lieu thereof will be required to be made at the time of
building permit.
H. AMMENDMENTS TO ORDINANCES 0-77-80, 0-78-50 AND 0-79-64

NOW, THEREFORE, THE CONDITIONS OF THIS OBLIGATION ARE:
PART I
PERFORMANCE BOND
1. The Principal and the Surety, jointly and severally bind themselves, their heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns to the Obligee for the completion of the
Improvements in a timely manner.
Page 1 of 7
2. If the Principal completes the Improvements, the Surety and the Principal shall have no other
obligation under this Bond, except to participate in conferences as provided for in
Subparagraph 3.1.
3. The Surety’s obligation under this bond shall arise after:
3.1 The Obligee has notified the Principal and the Surety, at its address described in
Paragraph 10 below, that the Obligee is considering declaring a Principal Default and
has requested and attempted to arrange a conference with the Principal and the
Surety to be held not later that 15 days after receipt of such notice to discuss methods
of completing the Improvements. If the Obligee, the Principal and the Surety
agree, the Principal shall be allowed to complete the Improvements, but such
agreement shall not waive the Obligee’s right, if any, subsequently, to declare a
Principal Default; and
3.2 The Obligee has declared a Principal Default. Such Principal Default shall not be
declared earlier than 20 days after the Principal and the Surety have received notice
as provided in Subparagraph 3.1.
3.3 Simultaneously with a declaration of Principal Default by the Obligee, or within a
reasonable period of time thereafter, the Obligee shall notify the Surety of the actions
that the Obligee requires in order to remedy the Principal Default. Pursuant to the
Obligee’s instructions, the Surety shall either:
3.3.1 Within 30 days, pay to the Obligee the full amount of the Performance Bond.
The Obligee shall thereupon utilize the bond proceeds solely to cause
completion of the work or to cause correction of defective work associated
with the Improvements. Any bond proceeds remaining after the completion
of the work or the correction of defective work shall be returned to the Surety
by the Obligee; or
3.3.2 Undertake to perform and complete the Improvements itself, through its
agents or through independent contractors; or
3.3.3 Obtain bids or negotiated proposals from qualified contractors acceptable to
the Obligee for a contract for performance and completion of the
Improvements, arrange for a contract to be prepared for execution by the
Obligee and the contractor selected with the Obligee’s concurrence, to be
secured with Performance and Payment Bonds issued by a qualified surety
equivalent to the bonds issued on the Improvements, and pay to the Obligee
the amount of damages as described in Paragraph 5.
Page 2 of 7
3.4 The Obligee’s determination of which course of action the Surety must pursue under
Paragraph 3.3 in order to remedy a Principal’s Default shall be final.
4. If the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 3 in a timely manner, the Surety
shall be deemed to be in default on this Bond.
5. After the Obligee has terminated the Principal’s right to complete the Improvements, then
the responsibilities of the Surety to the Obligee shall not be greater than those of the
Principal under the Improvements. To the limit of the amount of this Bond, the Surety is
obligated without duplication for:
5.1 The responsibilities of the Principal for correction of defective work and completion
of the Improvements;
5.2 Additional legal, design professional and delay costs resulting from the Principal’s
Default, and resulting from the actions or failure to act of the Surety under
Paragraphs 3 and 4; and
5.3 Actual damages caused by delayed performance or non-performance of the Principal.
6. The Surety shall not be liable to the Obligee or others for obligations of the Principal that are
unrelated to the Improvements. No right of action shall accrue on this Bond to any person or
entity other than the Obligee or its heirs, executors, administrators or successors.
7. The Surety hereby waives notice of any change, including changes of time, to the
Improvements or to related subcontracts, purchase orders and other obligations.
8. Any proceeding, legal or equitable, under this Bond may be instituted in any court of
competent jurisdiction in the location in which the work or part of the work is located and
shall be instituted within two years after Principal Default or within two years after the
Principal ceased working or within two years after the Surety refuses or fails to perform its
obligations under this Bond, whichever occurs first. If the provisions of this Paragraph are
void or prohibited by law, the minimum period of limitation available to sureties as a defense
in the jurisdiction of the suit shall be applicable.
9. In the event the Surety fails to perform its obligations hereunder in a timely manner, the
Obligee may commence legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in the
location where the Improvements are situated, and the Surety shall be responsible for the
payment of all the Obligee’s attorney’s fees and costs incurred in such proceeding, which
attorney’s fees and costs shall be in addition to, and not limited in any manner by, the
principal amount of this Bond.

3. The Surety’s obligation under this bond shall arise after:

Paragraph 10 below, that the Obligee is considering declaring a Principal Default and
has requested and attempted to arrange a conference with the Principal and the
Surety to be held not later that 15 days after receipt of such notice to discuss methods
of maintenance and / or repair of the Improvements. If the Obligee, the Principal and

Improvements, but such agreement shall not waive the Obligee’s right, if any,
subsequently, to declare a Principal Default; and
3.2 The Obligee has declared a Principal Default. Such Principal Default shall not be

3.3 Simultaneously with a declaration of Principal Default by the Obligee, or within a
reasonable period of time thereafter, the Obligee shall notify the Surety of the actions
that the Obligee requires in order to remedy the Principal Default. Pursuant to the

defective work associated with the Improvements. Any bond proceeds
remaining after the acceptance of the Improvements by the Village Board
shall be returned to the Surety by the Obligee; or

through its agents or through independent contractors; or
3.3.3 Obtain bids or negotiated proposals from qualified contractors acceptable to
the Obligee for a contract to perform maintenance and / or repair of the
Improvements, arrange for a contract to be prepared for execution by the
Obligee and the contractor selected with the Obligee’s concurrence, to be

secured with Maintenance and Payment Bonds issued by a qualified surety
equivalent to the bonds issued on the Improvements, and pay to the Obligee
the amount of damages as described in Paragraph 5.
3.4 The Obligee’s determination of which course of action the Surety must pursue under
Paragraph 3.3 in order to remedy a Principal’s Default shall be final.
4. If the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 3 in a timely manner, the Surety
shall be deemed to be in default on this Bond.
5. After the Obligee has terminated the Principal’s right to maintain and / or repair the
Improvements, then the responsibilities of the Surety to the Obligee shall not be greater

Bond, the Surety is obligated without duplication for:

competent jurisdiction in the location in which the work or part of the work is located and
shall be instituted within two years after Principal Default or within two years after the
Principal ceased working or within two years after the Surety refuses or fails to perform its
obligations under this Bond, whichever occurs first. If the provisions of this Paragraph are
void or prohibited by law, the minimum period of limitation available to sureties as a defense
in the jurisdiction of the suit shall be applicable.
9. In the event the Surety fails to perform its obligations hereunder in a timely manner, the
Obligee may commence legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in the
location where the Improvements are situated, and the Surety shall be responsible for the
payment of all the Obligee’s attorney’s fees and costs incurred in such proceeding, which

principal amount of this Bond.
10. Notice to the Surety, the Obligee or the Principal shall be mailed or delivered to the
address shown on the signature page.
