PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City 
of Miami Springs, Florida, as updated through Ordinance No. 873-2001, adopted June 11, 2001. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end 
thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time 
with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the 
reader can locate any section of the Miami Springs Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent 
ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will 
be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is 
maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

(Index or Indexes) 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice-President of Production, 
and Janet Cramer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully 
given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance 
throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Magali Valls, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during 
the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have 
resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Miami Springs readily 
accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's 
affairs.

an agreement with said Company, and, 
    WHEREAS, the recodification has been on file with the office of the City Clerk and subject to public 
inspection, and, 
    WHEREAS, in the interest of certainty with respect to ordinance provisions and to comply with law, it 
is deemed necessary forthwith to publish such recodification, renumbering, revision, and rearrangement 
of said ordinances in book form as the Code of Ordinances, 
    NOW THEREFORE, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Miami Springs, Florida:

and the same shall be printed and published in book form in the manner provided in Section 12 
hereof as the Code of Ordinances of the City of Miami Springs, Florida, and when so printed, 
published, and assembled in book form and certified as correct by the Clerk of the City shall be 
admitted in evidence and accepted by the courts and all persons as to the existence, 
effectiveness, and regularity of all enactments so published in said book form, as of the effective 
date designated herein. 
b. ?One copy of the Code of Ordinances, upon certification as to the correctness thereof in such 
book form by the Clerk of the City shall be kept in its initial form on file in the office of the Clerk 
and retained as a permanent ordinance record of the City. 
    Section?3.?Effective Date. The Code of Ordinances, consisting of the various titles as hereinbefore 
and therein designated, and all provisions thereof, shall take effect and be in force, at, on, and after 12:01 
A.M. Eastern Standard Daylight Savings Time on November 1, 1980. 
    Section?4.?Other Amendments and Supplements. The Code of Ordinances may be amended or 
supplemented at any time and, when any amendment or supplement is adopted in such form as to 
indicate the intention of this Council to make the same a part thereof, such amendment or supplement 
shall be incorporated in, and deemed a part of, the Code of Ordinances so that any reference to the Code 
of Ordinances shall be understood and construed as including the Code of Ordinances, and any all such 
amendments and supplements thereto. 
    Section?5.?Form of Amendment or Supplement. All amendments and supplements enacted as a 
part of the Code of Ordinances shall be integrated therewith by following the form of arrangement and 
plan hereby and therein adopted. Each title shall be sub-divided into chapters, and each chapter shall be 
sub-divided into sections. 
    Section?6.?How Known and Cited. This adopting ordinance, the Code of Ordinances of the City of 
Miami Springs, Florida, hereby adopted and any and all amendments and supplements which may be 
adopted shall be known and referred to as the Code of Ordinances shall be known and referred to either 
as "the code," "this code," " component code," or as designated in Section 1 hereof. 
    Section?7.?Master Copy. The Clerk of the City in addition to the book form copy in its initial form to 
be kept on file in the Clerk's office, pursuant to Section 2 hereof, shall keep a complete master copy in 
book form and in connection therewith or attached thereto in such form and manner as the Clerk may 
determine to be most easily available for most easy reference, a copy of all amendments and

designation, the Clerk of the City shall be guided by the advice of the City Attorney. 
    Section?8.?Interpretation. 
a. ?In the interpretation of any provision of the Code of Ordinances, or of any ordinance amending 
or supplementing the same, general terms, phrases, and expressions therein shall be liberally 
construed so as to carry out the intent and meaning of this Council, and shall have the meaning 
commonly ascribed thereto, unless a different meaning is required by the context or to give 
effect to such ordinances. 
b. ?The headings of sections contained in the Code of Ordinances shall be printed in all capital 
letters and are to be deemed to be in the nature of "catch words," and in case of conflict 
between such heading and the contents of any section, the contents of the section shall control, 
notwithstanding such headings. 
    Section?9.?Separability. Each section and each part of each section of the Code of Ordinances is 
hereby declared to be an independent section or part of a section and notwithstanding any other evidence 
of legislative intent that if any such section or part of a section, or any provision thereof, or the application 
thereof to any person or circumstances, is held to be invalid, the remaining sections or parts of sections 
and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstances, other than those as to which it 
is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that the 
Code of Ordinances would have been adopted independently of such section, sections, or part of a 
section so held to be invalid.

general and permanent nature pertaining to the subjects therein enumerated and embraced. All prior

are satisfactory to the City and that such terms and conditions are expressly extended to 
the City. 
(b) ?The bid or contract by the state or local government is in force prior to the proposed 
purchase of supplies or services by the City. 
(c) ?The purchasing agent has determined that purchasing materials, goods, supplies and 
contractual services under existing state or local government bids or contracts are in the 
best interests of the City. 
(6) ?The following methods of purchasing shall constitute exceptions to the competitive 
procurement processes previously specified herein: 
(a) ?City Manager delegation. The City Manager purchasing authority previously specified in 
subsections (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this section. 
(b) ?City Purchasing Agent delegations. The City Purchasing Agent authority previously 
specified in subsections (D)(1) and (D)(2) of this section. 
(c) ?Sole source purchase. A contract or purchase may be awarded without competition when 
the purchasing agent, in concurrence with the City Manager, makes a written determination 
that after conducting a good faith review of available sources, there is only one source for 
the required supplies, materials, or services. The City Purchasing Agent shall conduct all 
appropriate negotiations as to price, delivery and terms. A record of the sole source 
procurement shall be maintained as a public record and shall list each contractor's name, 
the amount and type of contract, a list of the item(s) or service(s) procured under each 
contract, and the identification number of each contract file.

of supplies or contractual services when there exists a clear and present threat to the 
public health, safety or welfare, provided, however, that such emergency procurement shall 
be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written 
determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular 
contractor shall be included in the contract file. As soon as practicable, a record of the 
emergency procurement shall be made and shall set forth the contractor's name, the 
amount and type of the contract, a listing of the item or items procured under the contract, 
and the number of the purchase order, if any. All such emergency purchases must be

(f) ?Disaster preparedness. Contracts for the supply of foods, goods and services made in 
contemplation and preparation for the occurrence of a natural or man-made disaster or of 
civil unrest, where availability, rather than price, is the controlling factor, are exempt from 
this section. 
(g) ?Waiver of competitive procurement procedure. The City Council may, by motion, waive the 
competitive procurement requirements of this section for good cause when it determines 
that such a waiver is in the best interests of the City. However, the motion to waive the 
competitive procurement requirements of this section must be passed by a four-fifths 
majority of the City Council. 
(F) ?Sealed bidding procedure. All purchases and procurements by the City which require utilization of 
sealed bids shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in this division. 
(1) ?Preparation of specifications. The initial requirement of the sealed bid procedure is the 
preparation of appropriate bid specifications. All bid specifications shall be drafted so as to 
promote the overall economy for the purposes intended to encourage competition in satisfying 
the City's need but not to be unduly restrictive. Brand name or equal specifications may be used 
when required to meet the specific needs of the City. In determining the appropriate contents of 
the bid specifications, the purchasing agent may utilize brand name or equal specifications if it 
is determined that:

(b) ?Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase description, not 
including a brand name or equal specification, or 
(c) ?The nature of the product or the nature of the City's requirements make use of a brand 
name or equal specification suitable for the procurement, or

contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement.

days prior to the date set forth in the notice for the opening of bids. Such notice shall be given 
by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The notice shall state the place, 
date and time of the bid opening. In addition, the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place 
in City Hall. 
(4) ?Addenda. Any modifications to the invitation to bid, terms and conditions of bid, specifications 
and drawings made prior to the closing date identified in the invitation to bid, shall be by 
addenda. All addenda shall be in writing and provided to all firms listed on the original bid 
mailing list and all additional firms otherwise provided with the original bid documentation. 
Verification of receipt of addenda will be kept with the bid documents and become a permanent 
part of that file. 
(5) ?Bid procedure. 
(a) ?Bid submission. Bids shall be submitted in a sealed envelope which shall be clearly 
identified as a sealed bid on the exterior of the envelope and delivered to the office of the 
purchasing agent. All bids shall contain a noncollusive affidavit, sworn to and executed by 
the bidder and acknowledged before a notary public with the notary seal affixed on the 
document. 
(b) ?Bid security. Bid security shall be required for all competitive bidding contracts. The City 
reserves the right to specify the amount of bid security on a bid-by-bid basis in the 
reasonable discretion of the City Purchasing Agent. In addition, the City Manager shall 
have the authority to waive or limit the bid security requirements contained herein upon 
such circumstances as are deemed to be in the best interests of the City. Bid security shall 
be by certified or cashier's check, cash, or by a bid bond made payable to the City and 
provided by a surety company authorized to do business as a surety in the state. The bid 
security of unsuccessful bidders will be returned within a reasonable time after the bid 
opening. The bid security of the successful bidder will be retained until such bidder has 
executed a contract and furnished any payment and performance bonds, along with all 
insurance policies, licenses, or other documentation that may be required by the City. If the 
successful bidder fails to furnish the required payment and performance bonds, fails to 
execute and deliver the contract, or fails to deliver the required insurance policies, licenses, 
or other documentation to the office of the purchasing agent within the time specified in the 
instructions to bidders, the City may annul the notice of award and the entire sum of the bid 
security shall be forfeited to the City. 
(c) ?Bid opening. 
1. ?Bids shall be opened publicly by the purchasing agent, or his designee, and shall be 
witnessed by any person duly authorized by the City Manager at the time and place 
designated in the public notice of the invitation for bids. 
2. ?Bids shall be read aloud and a tabulation of all bids received shall be made available 
for public inspection after the opening of the bid. 
3. ?No late bids shall be accepted or opened if received after the date and time specified 
in the public bid notice. All late bids shall be returned unopened to bidder. 
(d) ?Modification and withdrawal of bids. Bids may be modified or withdrawn by an appropriate 
document duly executed and delivered to the office of the purchasing agent at any time 
prior to the deadline for submitting bids. A request for withdrawal or modification must be in 
writing and signed by a person duly authorized to do so, and in a case where signed by 
deputy or subordinate, the principal's proper written authority to such deputy or subordinate 
must accompany the request for withdrawal or modification. After expiration of the period 
for receipt of bids, no bid may be withdrawn or modified. 
(e) ?Bid documentation becomes the property of the City. All bids received from bidders in 
response to the invitation to bid shall become the property of the City and will not be 
returned to the bidders. In the event of a contract award, all documentation produced as 
part of the contract shall become the exclusive property of the City. 
(f) ?Rejection of bids. The City may reject any bid for any of the following reasons: 
1. ?If the documentation submitted by the bidder, or the investigation of the bidder, prior to 
making a recommendation for award, fails to satisfy the City that the bidder is qualified 
to carry out the obligations and to complete the work contemplated therein. 
2. ?If there is reason to believe that collusion exists amongst the bidders. 
3. ?If the bid, in the City's sole discretion, is not responsive, properly delivered, not 
properly signed or is unsigned, shows serious omissions, alterations in form, additions 
not called for, conditions or unauthorized alterations, erasures, interlineations, or 
irregularities of any kind. The City, however, reserves the right to waive technical 
errors as may be deemed in the best interests of the City. 
4. ?Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the City further reserves 
the absolute right to reject all bids received when such action is deemed to be in the 
best interests of the City. 
(6) ?Award of contract. All bid award contracts shall be awarded with reasonable promptness to the 
lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set 
forth in the invitation to bid, except as otherwise provided herein. 
(a) ?Award to other than low bidder. When the award is not given to the lowest bidder, a full 
and complete statement of the reasons for placing the bid award will be prepared by the 
City's Purchasing Agent and filed with the other documents related to the transaction. 
(b) ?Tie bids. 
1. ?Local bidders. If all bids received are for the same total amount or unit price and offer 
equal quality or services, the contract will be awarded to a local bidder. If there is 
more than one local bidder, the City Council may award the bid in their sole discretion, 
allow the selection by random draw, or reject all bids. 
2. ?Nonlocal bidders. In instances in which division (6)(b)1. above does not apply, the City 
Council may award the bid in their sole discretion, allow the selection by random 
draw, or reject all bids. 
(7) ?Payment and performance bonds. All successful bidders awarded contracts pursuant to the 
provisions hereof shall be required to furnish the City with appropriate security in the form of 
performance bonds and payment bonds. The City, in its sole and exclusive discretion, may also 
require other bonds or security, in order to guaranty that the awarded contract with the City will 
be fully and appropriately performed and completed. 
(a) ?Performance bond. A bond satisfactory to the City, executed by a corporate surety 
authorized to do business in the state as a surety, in an amount equal 100 percent of the 
price specified in the contract. The bond shall provide that the bonding company will 
complete the project if the contractor defaults on his contract with the City by failing to 
perform the contract in the time and manner provided in the subject contract. 
(b) ?Payment bond. A bond satisfactory to the City, executed by a corporate surety authorized 
to do business in the state as a surety, in an amount equal to 100 percent of the price 
specified in the contract. The bond shall require the bonding company or surety to promptly 
pay all persons who supply labor, materials or supplies used directly or indirectly in the 
performance of the work provided for in the contract between the contractor and the City if 
the contractor fails to make any required payments promptly. 
(c) ?Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the City to require, in its 
sole and exclusive discretion, any additional protections, bonds, or other security in 
addition to the bonds previously specified herein. 
(d) ?In addition, the City Manager shall have the authority to waive or limit the requirements 
contained herein for payment or performance bonds upon such circumstances as are 
deemed to be in the best interests of the City. 
(8) ?Insurance. The successful bidder shall be required to obtain, at its own expense, all insurance 
coverages required under the terms of the bid specifications and awarded contract and to 
submit copies of all insurance policies to the finance director of the City for approval. No work 
under the contract may be commenced until the required insurance has been obtained and 
approved by the City. 
(9) ?Licenses. The successful bidder shall be required to be properly licensed to perform its 
contract with the City. No work under the contract may be commenced until the City has 
reviewed and approved the contractor's licenses. 
(10) ?Permits. Unless specified to the contrary in the bid specifications, it shall be the responsibility 
of the successful bidder to secure all required permits prior to the commencement of any work 
under its contract with the City. 
(11) ?Change orders. All changes to an executory contract made by a change order must 
reasonably and conscientiously be viewed as being in fulfillment of the original scope of the 
contract rather than a departure therefrom. 
(a) ?The City Manager, or his designee, is hereby authorized to approve and initiate work on 
the following types of change orders, determined in his judgment to be in the public 
interest, provided, however, that the parties mutually agree to the changes both as to the 
scope of the work and cost of the work: 
1. ?All change orders decreasing the cost of contracts to the City, provided, however, that 
such decreases do not materially alter the scope and character of the work 
contemplated by the contract. 
2. ?A change order, consisting of one or more changes, where the net change, taking into 
account both increases and decreases in cost, increases the cost of the contract to 
the City by an amount not in excess of $2,500.00, provided, however, that such 
increases do not materially alter the scope and character of the work. 
(b) ?All change orders authorized and approved by the City Manager, or his designee, 
pursuant to this section must be formally presented to the City Council as soon as is 
reasonably possible following the execution of the change order. 
(c) ?All other change orders must be formally approved by the City Council before work may 
be authorized to begin or work may be deleted as required by the contract. No claim 
against the City for extra work in furtherance of any such change order shall be allowed, 
unless said prior approval has been obtained, notwithstanding any other provision or 
agreement, contractual or otherwise. 
(d) ?Change orders shall not be artificially divided so as to bring the amount within the 
approval level of the City Manager, and any such proposed change order shall include all 
logically connected work required to be done at the time of the proposal. 
(G) ?Request for proposals procedure. 
(1) ?When the City Manager determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not 
practical or not advantageous to the City, a contract may be secured by the use of the request 
for proposals procedure. Requests for proposals shall state the relative importance of price, if 
appropriate, and all other evaluation factors and criteria that will be used by the City to 
determine the most qualified proposal. 
(2) ?If the request for proposals procedure is determined to be the most advantageous to the 
interests of the City, the procedures utilized to secure proposal responses shall be the same, or 
as nearly the same as possible and practical, as those employed in the procurement of sealed 
competitive bids provided in subsection (F) of this section. 
(H) ?Request for qualifications procedure. 
(1) ?When the City Manager determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding and request for 
proposal procedures are not appropriate, practical, or advantageous to the City, a contract may 
be secured by the use of the request for qualifications procedure. Requests for qualifications 
shall only request responses regarding the abilities, experience and special expertise that a 
responder may possess with regard to the work, project or services that are required by the 
City. 
(2) ?Responses shall not be required to include the projected fees, costs or expenses anticipated 
by the proposer for the services required by the City. 
(3) ?If the request for qualifications procedure is determined to be the most appropriate, practical 
and advantageous to the City, the procedures utilized to secure proposal responses shall be the 
same, or as nearly the same as possible and practical, as those employed in the procurement 
of sealed competitive bids provided in subsection (F) of this section. 
(4) ?Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the opening of all responses received, the City 
Manager, or his designee, shall review, evaluate, investigate and rank all responses. The City 
Manager, or his designee, shall then rank at least the three highest proposers. 
(5) ?The City Manager, his designee, or the City Council shall then conduct interviews with at least 
the three highest ranked proposers. If the interviews are conducted by the City Manager, or his 
designee, a report shall be presented to the City Council recommending the awarding of the 
contract to one of the interviewed proposers. 
(6) ?The City Council shall then authorize the City Manager, or his designee, to negotiate a contract 
with the recommended proposer. If the City Manager, or his designee, is unable to successfully 
negotiate a contract with the recommended proposer, City Council authorization shall be 
presumed, unless previously specified by the City Council to the contrary, to authorize the City 
Manager, or his designee, to then attempt to negotiate a contract with the next recommended 
proposer, and then the final recommended proposer, if necessary. 
(7) ?If the City Manager, or his designee, is unable to successfully negotiate a contract with any of 
the three highest ranked proposers, the City Manager may, in his sole and exclusive discretion, 
proceed to negotiate with the next highest ranked proposers, or declare the request and 
selection process to be unsuccessfully concluded. 
(8) ?All contracts negotiated by the City Manager, or his designee, with any qualified proposer shall 
be presented to and approved by the City Council prior to execution by the City. 
(I) ?Sale of surplus or obsolete City personal property. Whenever the City shall seek to dispose of 
personal property which is surplus or obsolete to the needs of the City, the following procedures shall 
apply:

his designee, shall submit a written report to the City Council advising of the results of the 
disposal process utilized by the City.

contemplated include the establishment of financial reserves and securing professional qualified 
administrators. The City Manager is specifically authorized and directed to ascertain that the City's 
financial interest is fully protected at all times. Any provisions of this section notwithstanding, in the 
event that adequate financial reserves have not been provided, or an analysis of the costs involved 
demonstrates that it is more economical for the City to maintain coverage for certain specific risks

protest set forth in this section, also provide a copy of the written protest filed with the City to the 
party who received the selection and award by the City Council. 
(F) ?Stay of selection and award. Upon the receipt of a timely filed and proper and appropriate written 
protest, and in the absence of emergency circumstances or conditions, the City Manager shall stay 
any further action in regard to the selection and award until the protest has been resolved. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the City Manager, after consultation with the City Purchasing Agent 
and any other required administrative officials, determines, in writing, that a contract must be entered 
into in regard to the City Council's selection and award without delay in order to protect the public 
health, safety and welfare, the filed bid protest shall not delay or otherwise impede any and all 
processes or procedures required to finalize a contract with the successful party. 
(G) ?City Manager review. Following receipt of a timely filed and proper and appropriate written protest, 
the City Manager, and any other administrative officers or specially qualified parties that may be 
designated by the Manager, shall review, examine and investigate the entire sealed competitive 
selection process being protested. Upon completion, the City Manager may contact the protestor in 
an attempt to resolve the protest prior to the scheduling of a protest meeting. If attempts to resolve 
the protest are unsuccessful, prior to rendering a decision, the City Manager shall schedule and 
conduct a protest meeting in order to hear arguments from the protestor and the successful bidder or 
responder. 
(H) ?Protest meeting. At the protest meeting, the protester and the successful bidder or responder, or 
their designated legal counsel, will be allowed to make brief oral presentations of evidence and 
argument. However, neither direct nor cross examination of witnesses will be permitted, although the 
City Manager, or designee, may make whatever inquiries are deemed pertinent to a determination of 
the protest. Submission of written or physical materials, objects, statements, affidavits and 
arguments relevant to the protest may be submitted three business days prior to the protest meeting. 
The City Manager, or designee, may solicit and receive input from City employees, consultants and 
other persons who are not parties to the protest. The statutory and judicial rules of evidence shall not 
apply at the meeting, but any party may arrange for the meeting to be stenographically recorded as 
long as the party bears the expense of such recording. 
(I) ?Protest meeting decision. The City Manager shall have the authority to uphold the selection and 
award of the City Council, concur with the protest and request a reconsideration of the selection and 
award by the City Council, request a rejection of the sealed competitive selection process by the City 
Council, or any other action deemed just and appropriate by the City Manager. The decision of the 
City Manager may be orally announced at the end of the protest meeting. However, the City 
Manager shall then promptly issue a written decision stating the reasons for the action taken and 
provide copies to the protesting party and the successful bidder or responder. The decision of the 
City Manager shall be final, but may be appealed to the City Council. 
(J) ?Appeal to City Council. An appeal of the City Manager's decision to the City Council may be filed by 
either the protesting party or the successful bidder or responder by filing a written notice of appeal 
with the City Clerk no later than the close of business three business days following receipt of the 
City Manager's written decision on the protest. The form and content of the notice of appeal shall 
comply with the requirements for written protests set forth in subsection (D) hereof, except that the 
notice shall be presented in an appellate rather than protest context. 
(K) ?City Council appeal hearing. If an appeal is timely, properly and appropriately filed, the City Council 
will conduct a public hearing on the appeal at a time, date and place to be determined by the City 
Council. The City Council's appellate review of the City Manager's protest decision shall be on a de 
novo basis and substantially similar to the process and procedures utilized at the protest meeting set 
forth in subsection (H) hereof. Any party may arrange, at their cost and expense, for the appeal 
hearing to be stenographically recorded for future use. Following the presentations by the parties, 
the City Council shall, during the public meeting, conduct its deliberations and determine the 
resolution of the appeal by a vote of the Council. The decision of the City Council shall be 
memorialized in a written order and provided to the parties participating in the appeal. 
(L) ?Exclusive method of protest and appeal. There is a compelling City interest in procuring goods and 
services in a timely manner so as to provide City residents and all others with efficient, inexpensive 
and operationally effective City infrastructure, facilities, goods and services. Consequently, 
procurement disputes must be resolved with minimal delays. Therefore, the procedures set forth 
herein are the sole and exclusive means by which a bidder or responder, aggrieved by a decision of 
the City, may seek recourse. Refusal or failure by any aggrieved bidder or responder to pursue its 
right of protest and appeal, pursuant to the aforesaid procedures, shall constitute a waiver of its right 
to pursue any further remedies or appeals, either administratively or judicially. Any judicial 
proceedings that may or could be filed against the City by an aggrieved or adversely affected party 
shall be filed within 30 days following receipt of the City Council's appellate order. The failure to 
timely file a judicial action in accordance with these procedures shall constitute a waiver and 
invalidation of any further appeal of the City Council's decision.

32-72. Former Art. VIII, §§ 32-6532-71, pertained to Code Enforcement Board, and derived from Ord. 
661-82, passed June 14, 1982; Ord. 664-82, passed Sept. 13, 1982; Ord. 808-94, passed Jan. 10, 1994. 


Sec. 32-60. - Establishment. 
    The City hereby establishes and creates a code compliance board with the authority to impose 
administrative fines and other noncriminal penalties to provide an equitable, expeditious, effective and 
inexpensive method of enforcing the City's codes and ordinances pursuant to chapter 162, Florida 
Statutes, as amended. 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-61. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, shall have the meanings ascribed to them by this section 
when used in this article: 
    Board means the City Code Compliance Board as appointed by the City Council or designee 
pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
    Code inspector means a Code Compliance Inspector or any City employee authorized by the City 
Manager or designee to ensure compliance with the City Code. 
    Repeat violation means a violation of a provision of the City Code by a person who has been 
previously found by a Code Compliance Board or any other quasi-judicial or judicial process, to have 
violated or who has admitted violating the same City Code provision within five years prior to the violation, 
notwithstanding the violations occur at different locations. 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-62. - Code Compliance Board; organization. 
    The Code Compliance Board shall be organized as follows: 
(1) ?The board shall be comprised of seven members, the qualifications of which shall be as 
specified in § 32-01. Whenever possible, the City Council shall endeavor to appoint individuals 
with licenses, experience, and/or education in architecture, engineering, construction, law, 
and/or real estate. 
(2) ?Each Councilmember shall be responsible for appointing at least one member to the board. 
The additional two members of the board shall be individually selected by members of the 
Council, the responsibility of which will rotate, with the Mayor and Council Member in Group 1 
having the first two appointments, and following sequentially through the Council upon the 
expiration of the board members term. Upon the expiration of a board member's term, the City 
Council member making the original appointment, or that City Council member's successor in 
office, shall appoint the board member to serve during the new board term or replace the 
member for the new term, except for the positions selected by the rotation of the City Council. If, 
for any reason, an appointment should not be made to fill an expired term, the incumbent will 
continue to serve until his successor has been appointed. 
(3) ?Two additional members shall be appointed to the board and designated as "alternate 
members," who shall be appointed by the Mayor and Councilmembers in the same manner as 
regular board members are appointed, with the Council Members in Groups 2 and 3 having the 
first appointments, and so on, as noted in section (2) above. The alternate member shall be 
required to attend all board meetings and shall be subject to the same appointment, terms, and 
vacancy provisions as are regular board members.) In the temporary absence or disability of a 
regular member, or in an instance where a regular member is otherwise disqualified to sit on a 
particular matter, the alternate member shall sit as a board member to obtain a full membership, 
or, as nearly as possible, a full membership. When so acting, the alternate member shall have 
full rights of participation and voting as regular members; his vote shall be deemed that of a 
member in reaching a decision on a matter. In instances where the alternate member is not 
sitting as a member, he shall have the right to participate in board discussions and to ask 
questions, but shall have no right to vote or make motions. When the alternate member has 
been required to sit as a member on a particular matter the alternate shall continue to sit as a 
board member through the disposition of the matter; and he shall not be replaced until the 
hearing on the matter is concluded. 
(4) ?The initial appointments to each board shall be as follows: 
(a) ?Two members appointed for a term of one year each by the Mayor and Council Member in 
Group 1. 
(b) ?Three members appointed for a term of two years each by Council Members in Groups 2, 
3, and 4. 
(c) ?Two members appointed for a term of three years each by the Mayor and Council Member 
in Group 1. 
(d) ?One alternate member shall be appointed to each board for an initial term of two years, 
the other alternate member shall be appointed to an initial term of one year, by 
Councilmembers in Groups 2 and 3, respectively. 
Thereafter, any appointment shall be made for a term of three years. 
(5) ?An appointment to fill any vacancy on a board shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
A failure of a board member to follow the attendance policy provided in § 32-02(A)(2) shall be 
deemed removed from the board. The City Clerk shall inform the City Council in writing of the 
vacancy and the City Council shall promptly fill such vacancy. 
(6) ?Board members shall serve in accordance with all applicable City laws and may be suspended 
and removed as per § 32-02. 
(7) ?Board members shall elect a chairperson, who shall be a voting member, from among the 
members of the board. The presence of four or more members shall constitute a quorum of the 
board. Members shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for such travel, 
mileage, and per diem expenses as may be authorized by City Council or as are otherwise 
provided by law. 
(8) ?A special magistrate, appointed by the City Council or pursuant to City Council authorization, 
may preside over code compliance hearings in the same capacity as the board. A special 
magistrate shall have the same status as the board, pursuant to Chapter 162, Florida Statutes. 
A special magistrate shall be an attorney admitted to practice law in the State of Florida and in 
good standing with the Florida Bar, and have a thorough understanding of City Code 
compliance matters, the City Code and all applicable laws and regulations. References in this 
article, except in this section, to a board shall be synonymous with the term "special 
magistrate." 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-63. - Representation by the City Attorney. 
    The City Attorney or the City Attorney's designee shall represent the City before the board. 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-64. - Code compliance procedures. 
    It shall be the duty of the code inspector to initiate code compliance proceedings when, based upon 
personal investigation, the code inspector has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of a duly 
enacted City Code exists. No member of the board shall have the power to initiate such proceedings. 
(A) ?Notice of violation and summons to appear. 
(1) ?Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), if a violation of the code is found, the code 
inspector shall notify the violator in writing and give the violator a reasonable time to 
correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, 
the code inspector shall request a board hearing. The City Attorney shall review and 
approve each code compliance case prior to being scheduled for a board hearing. The 
board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of the hearing 
shall be provided to the violator pursuant to § 32-71 of this article. If the violation is 
corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the specified time for 
correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the board, even if the 
violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(2) ?If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required 
to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon 
notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the board by requesting a hearing. 
The board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and provide notice pursuant 
to § 32-71 of this article. The case may be presented to the board even if the repeat 
violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. If a 
repeat violation has been corrected but is presented to the board at a hearing, the board 
retains the right to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement 
fees upon the repeat violator. 
(3) ?If the code inspector has reason to believe that a violation or the condition causing the 
violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation 
is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to 
notify the violator and may immediately notify the board and request a hearing. 
(4) ?If the owner of the property that is subject to a code compliance proceeding before the 
board transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial notice was served 
and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(a) ?Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective 
transferee. 
(b) ?Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other 
materials relating to the code compliance proceeding received by the transferor. 
(c) ?Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be 
responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the 
code compliance proceeding. 
(d) ?File a notice with the code compliance official of the transfer of the property, with the 
identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new 
owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) before the 
transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the 
hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a 
reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(B) ?Citations. 
(1) ?(a) ?A violation of the code is a civil infraction for which a citation may be issued pursuant 
to this section. Prior to issuing a citation, a code inspector shall provide notice to the 
person that the person has committed a violation of the code and shall establish a 
reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time 
period shall be no more than 30 days. If, upon personal investigation, a code 
inspector finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the time period, a 
code inspector may issue a citation to the person who has committed the violation. A 
code inspector does not have to provide the person with a reasonable time period to 
correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation if a 
repeat violation is found or if the code inspector has reason to believe that the 
violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the 
violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(b) ?A citation issued by a code inspector shall include but not be limited to the following: 
(1) ?The date and time of issuance. 
(2) ?The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued. 
(3) ?The date and time the violation was committed. 
(4) ?The facts constituting reasonable cause. 
(5) ?The section number of the specific code that has been violated. 
(6) ?The name of the code inspector and their division or department. 
(7) ?Instructions and due date to pay the civil penalty or to contest the citation. 
(8) ?The applicable civil penalty if the person elects to contest the citation. 
(9) ?The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
(10) ?A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within 
the time allowed, or fails to appear at a hearing to contest the citation, the person 
shall be deemed to have waived their right to contest the citation and that, in 
such case, judgement may be entered against the person for an amount up to 
the maximum civil penalty. 
(11) ?Notice that the person may be liable for the reasonable costs of the hearing to 
contest the violation should the citation be affirmed by the board at such hearing. 
(2) ?The maximum civil penalty for a civil infraction shall not exceed $500.00. 
(3) ?Citations shall be served in the same manner as provided by § 32-71 of this article. 
(4) ?A violator who has been served with a citation shall elect either to: 
(a) ?Pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the citation, and correct the violation; 
or 
(b) ?Request an administrative hearing before the board to appeal the determination of 
the code compliance officer which resulted in the issuance of the citation. 
(5) ?If the violator chooses to appeal the citation, he or she must file a written request for an 
administrative hearing within 20 calendar days after service of the citation. 
(6) ?The administrative hearing shall be conducted in accordance with § 32-65 of this article, 
as applicable. 
(7) ?If the violator fails to pay the civil penalty and correct the violation within the time specified 
by code compliance officer or fails to timely appeal the citation, such failure shall constitute 
a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing before the board. Such waiver 
shall be deemed an admission of the violation and civil penalties may be assessed 
accordingly. 
(8) ?A certified copy of an order affirming the citation and imposing a civil penalty may be 
recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County, Florida, and all enforcement 
remedies shall be applicable as provided by § 32-67(C) of this article. 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-65. - Conduct of hearing. 
(A) ?Upon request by the code inspector, or at such other times as may be necessary, the chairperson 
of the board may call a code compliance hearing; such hearing also may be called by written notice 
signed by at least three members of the seven-member board. The board, at any hearing, may set a 
future hearing date. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings by the code compliance board, and all

special business or announcements by the City Attorney. 
(D) ?Each case before the board shall be presented by the City Attorney after determining that the case

before the board, the City Attorney shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the 
case and such costs may be included in the lien authorized by § 32-67 of this article. 
(E) ?The board shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under 
oath and shall be recorded. The City Attorney shall provide a brief description of the case, including 
but not limited to the case number, the property address and owner, and the violations at issue. 
Thereafter, the alleged violator shall plea either guilty or not guilty to the violations at issue. If the 
alleged violator pleads guilty, the board may proceed to take testimony from the code inspector, as 
well as the violator, in order to assess a reasonable time for compliance and fines in the event 
compliance is not achieved. If the alleged violator pleads not guilty, the City Attorney shall proceed to 
prosecute the case. 
(F) ?The board shall take testimony from the code inspector. The alleged violator shall be given an 
opportunity to testify, but shall not be compelled to offer testimony or any evidence. Each party to the 
hearing shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine 
opposing witnesses, impeach and rebut evidence. 
(G) ?If notice of the hearing has been provided to the alleged violator, the hearing may be conducted 
and an order shall be rendered in the violator's absence. 
(H) ?The formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and 
shall govern the proceedings. Any relevant evidence is admissible if the board finds it competent and 
reliable, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule to the contrary. Hearsay 
evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence, but it shall not 
be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. 
(I) ?The City shall have the burden of proof to show, by the greater weight of the evidence, that the 
alleged violation occurred or continues to exist, and that the alleged violator committed or is 
responsible for that violation. 
(J) ?At the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall issue findings of fact, based on the evidence of 
record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the 
powers granted herein. If the hearing is before the board, the findings shall be by motion approved 
by a majority of those members present and voting, except that at least four members of the board, 
which may include alternate members, must vote in order for the action to be official. The order shall 
be prepared by the board secretary and executed by the board chairperson at the conclusion of the 
board meeting at which such order was issued. The order may include a notice that it must be 
complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by 
said date. If the order is not complied with by said date, a certified copy of such order shall be 
recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent 
purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings 
therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent 
purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant 
to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the board shall 
issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is 
not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance.

Sec. 32-66. - Powers of the board. 
    The board shall have the power to: 
(1) ?Adopt rules for the conduct of its hearings. 
(2) ?Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the 
Sheriff of the County or Police Department of the City. 
(3) ?Subpoena evidence to its hearings. 
(4) ?Take testimony under oath. 
(5) ?Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a 
violation into compliance. 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-67. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens. 
(A) ?The board, upon notification by the code inspector or City Attorney that an order of the board 
has not been complied with by the set time for compliance or upon finding that a repeat violation 
has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section 
for each day the violation continues past the date set by the board or, in the case of a repeat 
violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat 
violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a 
violation described in § 32-64(A)(3), the board shall notify the City, which may make all 
reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the 
violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this 
section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the City to 
make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the City 
for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a 
violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be 
necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the board 
finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine 
as specified in paragraph (B)(1). 
(B) ?(1) ?A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first 
violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may 
include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (1). However, if the board finds the 
violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed 
$5,000.00 per violation. 
(2) ?In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the board shall consider the following factors: 
(a) ?The gravity of the violation; 
(b) ?Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(c) ?Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(C) ?A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the 
public records of Miami-Dade County, Florida, and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the 
property on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by 
the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same 
manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against 
the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment 
except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue 
until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to 
this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section 
runs in favor of the City, and the City may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered 
pursuant to this section. The City Attorney may foreclose upon any lien that remains unpaid 
after three months from the filing of any such lien. The duration and effect of such lien shall be 
consistent with state law, which is a period of 20 years. No lien created pursuant to the 
provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real property that is a designated homestead under 
s. 4, Art. X of the State Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not 
apply to real property or personal property that is covered under s. 4(a), Art. X of the State 
Constitution. 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-68. - Mitigation of fines. 
(A) ?The violator, or the violator's successors or assigns who have an ownership interest in the property 
encumbered by a lien pursuant to this article may request a mitigation hearing to reduce the fines 
only after the violations encompassed within the code compliance case have been corrected. Upon 
receipt of a written request for a mitigation hearing, the clerk for the board shall set the matter for a 
hearing before the board. 
(B) ?A mitigation hearing is not an appeal or a de novo review of the code compliance case. The formal 
quasi-judicial procedures shall not apply. 
(C) ?At the mitigation hearing, the board may consider the following criteria: 
(1) ?Good cause for a reduction of the fines. 
(2) ?The cooperation of the violator, including whether the violator appeared before the board at the 
original hearing. 
(3) ?The gravity of the violation. 
(4) ?The actions taken by the violator to correct the violation. 
(5) ?Whether there was an extraordinary hardship, which affected compliance. 
(6) ?Whether the violator is a repeat violator. 
(7) ?The total or estimated costs incurred by the City for the handling of the case. 
(8) ?The amount of the proposed reduction. 
(9) ?Any equitable considerations raised by the violator or the City relating to the amount of the 
reduction. 
(10) ?The number of days that the violation existed. 
(D) ?In no event shall the fines be reduced below the costs incurred by the City in its prosecution of the 
violations. 
(E) ?The board has the discretion to grant or deny a request for mitigation.

Government Code Enforcement Boards Act shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the 
certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action is 
commenced pursuant to section 162.09(3), Florida Statutes, as amended, in a court of competent 
jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to 
recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee that it incurs in the action. The City shall be 
entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien 
effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent 
purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
( Ord. 1093-2017, passed 8-28-17 ) 


Sec. 32-70. - Appeal. 
    An aggrieved party, including the City, may appeal a final administrative order of the board to the 
Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida. Such an appeal shall 
not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the board. 
An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed.

secretary of the Civil Service Board shall deliver the declarations of candidacy to the chairman of the 
Civil Service Board. The chairman shall cause appropriate ballots to be prepared and delivered to 
the recording secretary of the Civil Service Board for safekeeping until the opening of the polls on the

election. 
(G) ?Inspector of election. The Civil Service Board shall designate an experienced inspector for each 
election who is not a City employee, and who shall be responsible for the proper conduct of all 
matters pertaining to the election. The inspector shall be on duty from the opening to the closing of 
the polls, and shall be paid an appropriate sum for his services. 
(H) ?Form of ballot. 
(1) ?Across the top of the ballot shall be printed the following caption, "Official Ballot, Civil Service 
Board Election." Beneath the caption shall be printed the date of the election. 
(2) ?Beneath the date of the election shall be the following: 
"To vote for a person whose name is printed on the ballot, place a cross mark (X) in the square 
at the right of the name of the person for whom you wish to vote." 
(3) ?Preceding the names of the candidates, shall be the following: 
"Vote for one." 
(4) ?The names of the candidates shall be listed alphabetically, according to the first letter of the

candidate shall be considered as automatically elected for the three-year term without further 
formal election. The Civil Service Board shall certify this fact to the City Council. 
(7) ?The chairman may include additional language on the ballot form that further explains the 
proper method of voting. 
(I) ?Voting procedure. An employee wishing to vote shall identify himself or herself to the inspector of the 
election by name. If the list of qualified voters indicates that the employee has not already voted, the 
inspector will initial an official ballot, and hand it to the employee and place a check mark opposite 
the employee's name on the list of qualified voters to indicate that a ballot has been delivered to the 
employee. The employee will then retire to the voting booth, or another designated area, secretly 
mark the ballot, fold it, and deposit it in the ballot box. If none of the candidates on the printed ballot 
are acceptable to the voter, he may write in the name of his choice, and mark the ballot accordingly. 
(J) ?Voided ballots. A ballot shall be considered void and not counted by the canvassing board for any of 
the following reasons: 
(1) ?No cross mark to indicate the voter's choice of candidates.

(1) ?Any employee who anticipates that it will be physically impossible for him or her to be present 
at the polls during election hours may submit a written request for an absentee ballot to the 
recording secretary of the Civil Service Board. The recording secretary shall then hand or mail 
the employee an official ballot, after writing on it, "Absentee Ballot," followed by her initials. At 
the same time, she will mark opposite the employee's name, on the list of qualified voters, the 
letter "A" to indicate that the employee will vote by absentee ballot. 
(2) ?Applications for absentee ballot must be received by the recording secretary of the Civil 
Service Board not later than 4:00 p.m. of the day preceding the election. An application for an 
absentee ballot automatically disqualifies the employee from voting at the polls, even though he 
or she later finds that he or she can do so. The absentee ballots shall be handed or mailed by 
the voter to the recording secretary of the Civil Service Board, who shall retain them under lock 
and key until the polls open, at which time they shall be delivered to the inspector of the 
election.

(b) ?Number of absentee ballots. 
(c) ?Number of ballots voided. 
(d) ?Total number of valid votes, including absentee ballots. 
(e) ?Number of votes received by each candidate. 
(2) ?Certification of the results shall be signed in triplicate by the canvassing board members 
present, and shall be in triplicate, with one copy going to the City Council, one copy going to the 
Civil Service Board, and one copy being posted at the polling place. 
(3) ?The canvass of the election results shall be open to members of the City Council, members of 
the Civil Service Board, and to all City employees. The ballots and all official records of the 
election shall be preserved by the Civil Service Board until the results of the election are 
accepted by the City Council, after which time, they shall be destroyed. 
(4) ?The candidate receiving the highest number of valid votes cast shall be declared the winner of 
the employee representative position on the Civil Service Board. 
(O) ?Protests. Any protest regarding the conduct of the election must be made in writing and submitted 
to the City Council at the next regular meeting subsequent to the date of the election. The decision of 
the City Council on all protests shall be final. 
(P) ?Filling of vacancy of employee representatives on the Civil Service Board. In the event that any 
vacancy is created on the Civil Service Board in either, or both, of the employee representative 
positions on said board, the vacancy or vacancies shall be filled in the following manner: 
(1) ?A special employee election shall be held within 90 days of the vacancy or vacancies to fill the 
vacant position or positions. 
(2) ?The rules, regulations, and procedures governing the regular election of employee 
representatives to the Civil Service Board outlined herein shall be utilized in conducting the 
special employee election, except that the dates specified therein may be appropriately 
adjusted to conform with dates required for the proper administration of the special employee 
election. 
(3) ?All special employee elections shall be conducted to only fill the remaining term in office of the 
employee representative position that has been vacated. 
(4) ?In the event that both employee representative positions on the Civil Service Board are vacant 
and sought to be filled in the same special employee election, the employee receiving the 
highest number of votes in said special election shall fill the position on the board that has the 
longest remaining unexpired term. In the event of a special election tie ballot, the employee 
representatives elected shall flip a coin to determine which unexpired term each will fill. 
(5) ?If all election requirements can be met, a special election to fill a board vacancy may be 
conducted contemporaneously with a regularly scheduled employee representative election. 
(6) ?However, there shall be no obligation or requirement to hold a special employee election to fill 
any vacancy if the position that is vacant is scheduled to be filled in a regular employee election 
that will occur within 180 days of the creation of the vacancy.

employees.

Sec. 34-17. - Employee disciplinary action. 
(A) ?Intent. 
(1) ?It is the intent of the civil service system that effective supervision and employee relations will 
avoid most matters which necessitate disciplinary action. The purpose of the rules, and 
disciplinary action for violation of the rules, is not intended to restrict the rights of anyone but to 
insure the rights of all and to secure cooperation and orderliness throughout the civil service 
system. 
(2) ?In recognition of the fact that each instance differs in many respects from somewhat similar 
situations, the City retains the right to treat each occurrence on an individual basis without 
creating a precedent for other cases which may arise in the future. The City retains the right to 
suspend any disciplinary action which it may take, during good behavior for a specified term, at 
its exclusive discretion. 
(3) ?Examples given in any rule do not limit the generality of the rule. The rules and regulations are 
not to be construed as a limitation on the retained rights of the City, but merely as a guide to 
provide recommended standard penalties for specific offenses. This is intended to mean that a 
more severe penalty may be issued than that which appears in the standard procedure if it is 
felt necessary. 
(4) ?The types of offenses requiring disciplinary action are divided into three types to reflect 
degrees of severity of offenses. 
(5) ?In each group and for each rule consideration will be given to the severity of the offense, the 
cost involved, the time interval between violations, the length and quality of service records, and 
the ability of the employee concerned. In each case where the penalty is modified from the 
recommended standard, the reasons for such modification will be noted in writing. 
(6) ?In addition to the general types of offenses listed, infraction of departmental rules and 
regulations will subject the employee to disciplinary action. 
(B) ?Authority and procedure. 
(1) ?Removals, suspensions, and demotions for cause are effected by department heads or by the 
City Manager. 
(2) ?Whenever the department head determines that there are reasons for dismissal, suspension, 
or demotion of a regular employee under his supervision in the civil service, the department 
head shall notify the legal department and the personnel director in writing thereof as quickly as 
is practicable. 
(3) ?In the event that an employee is relieved of duties pending suspension, reduction, or dismissal, 
the legal department and personnel director shall be notified not more than 48 hours after such 
relief from duty. 
(4) ?Within 30 days after the notification required above, written notice of suspension, reduction, or 
dismissal, stating the reasons therefore and the date from which such action is effective, shall 
be given to such employee or mailed to his usual place of residence. A copy of such notice shall 
be submitted to the personnel director. 
(5) ?In the event that good and sufficient reasons exist making it impractical or impossible to give or 
mail such written notice to the employee within the 30-day period, the personnel director, 
showing good cause, may extend the period for giving notice for an additional period not to 
exceed 30 days. 
(6) ?Any permanent, full-time employee may appeal such disciplinary action within ten working days 
after delivery or mailing of the written notice, by filing a written request for a hearing to the Civil 
Service Board in the office of the personnel director. 
(C) ?Written reprimand. 
(1) ?Whenever employee performance, attitude, work habits, or personal conduct at any time fall 
below a desirable level, supervisors shall inform employees promptly and specifically of such 
lapses and give counsel and assistance. If appropriate and justified, a reasonable period of time 
for improvements may be allowed before initiating disciplinary measures. 
(2) ?In situations where an oral warning has not resulted in the expected improvement, a written 
reprimand shall be issued defining the nature of the infraction under the rules. The written 
reprimand will be sent to the employee and a copy shall be placed in the employee's personnel 
folder. The employee's immediate supervisor usually initiates a written reprimand. 
(D) ?Suspensions. 
(1) ?A department head may, for disciplinary purposes, suspend an employee without pay for a 
length of time appropriate to the offense, not to exceed 20 working days in any 12-month 
period. 
(2) ?On request of the employee, the department head has the option of making an equivalent 
deduction from the employee's accumulated compensatory leave or annual leave in lieu of 
suspension without pay. The department head may apply this equivalent deduction to all or part 
of the employee's suspension time. 
(3) ?In cases where an employee is charged with a crime and the department head determines that 
the charge has some bearing on the employee's performance of his job if found guilty, the 
department head shall make a review of the matter and may suspend the employee without pay 
until the final determination of the court. If the employee is subsequently acquitted of the crime, 
the employee will be reinstated with full back pay and benefits. 
(E) ?Types of offenses. The three groups of offenses and guides for standard recommended penalties 
are as follows: 
Group I Offenses 
(1) ?First offenseWritten reprimand

(B) ?Amount of contributions. The contribution of a member shall be five percent of member 
compensation effective October 1, 1989. A member who contributed three percent of his 
compensation prior to October 1, 1989, shall contribute five percent of his compensation on and after 
October 1, 1989. In the event that the City agrees to assume and pay member contributions in lieu of 
direct contributions by the member, such contributions shall accordingly be paid into the fund in 
behalf of the members. No member subject to such agreement shall have the option of choosing to 
receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the City directly to the fund. 
All such contributions by the City shall be deemed and considered as part of the member's 
accumulated contributions and subject to all provisions of this system pertaining to accumulated 
contributions of members. The intent of this language is to comply with section 414(h)(2) of Internal 
Revenue Code. 
(C) ?Deduction from compensation. The officer or officers responsible for making up the payroll shall 
cause the contributions provided for in division (B) above to be deducted from the compensations of 
each member on each and every payroll, for each and every payroll period, from the date of his 
entrance in the retirement system to the date his City employment terminates. The members 
contributions provided for herein shall be made, notwithstanding that the minimum compensation 
provided by law for any member is thereby changed. Each member shall be deemed to consent and 
agree to the deductions made and provided for herein. Payment of his compensation less the 
deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands 
whatsoever for the services rendered by him during the period covered by the payment, except as to 
benefits provided by §§ 35-0135-45. When deducted, each of the contributions shall be paid into 
the members deposit fund, and shall be credited to the individual account of the member from whose 
compensation the deduction was made. 
(D) ?Additional deposits required. In addition to the contributions deducted from the compensations of a 
member, as hereinbefore provided, a member shall deposit in the members deposit fund, by a single 
contribution, or by an increased rate of contribution as approved by the Board of Trustees, all 
amounts he may have withdrawn therefrom and not repaid thereto, together with regular interest 
from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. In no case shall any member be given credit 
for service rendered prior to the date he withdrew his accumulated contributions until he repays to 
the members deposit fund all amounts due the fund by him. 
(E) ?Transfers to pension reserve fund. Upon the retirement of a member, his accumulated contributions 
standing to his credit in the members deposit fund shall be transferred to the pension reserve fund. 
Except as otherwise provided in §§ 35-0135-45, at the expiration of a period of four years from and 
after the date a member ceases to be an employee of the City, any balance standing to his credit in 
the members deposit fund, unclaimed by the member or his legal representative, shall be transferred 
to the pension reserve fund. 
(F) ?Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (B) hereof, if in any annual contribution period it is 
actuarially determined that in order to maintain the retirement system on a sound actuarial basis, a 
fiscal year contribution to the system in excess of 15 percent is required (comprised of the City 
contribution of ten percent required by Code § 35-33(B) and the member contribution of five percent 
required by Code § 35-31(B)), then one-half of any required excess contribution that is actuarially 
determined to be necessary shall be made by the member/employees of the City General 
Employees Retirement Plan.

Sec. 35-32. - Refunds of contributions to members deposit fund. 
(A) ?Cessation of employment. Should any member cease to be employed by the City, and not be 
entitled to a pension payable from funds of the retirement system, he shall be paid the balance 
standing to his credit in the members deposit fund, provided he files his written application for same 
with the Board of Trustees. 
(B) ?Death. Upon the death of a member, if no pension becomes payable on account of his City 
employment, the balance standing to his credit in the members deposit fund at the time of his death 
shall be paid to the person or persons as he shall have nominated by written designation, duly 
executed and filed with the Board of Trustees. If no such designated person or persons survives the 
member, his accumulated contributions shall be paid to his estate. 
(C) ?Manner of payment. Payment of refunds of members deposit fund balances, as provided for in this 
section, may be made in monthly installments according to the rules and regulations as the Board of 
Trustees may from time to time adopt.

contributions made by the City to the retirement system, and from which shall be paid all pensions as 
provided in §§ 35-0135-45. 
(B) ?Computation; financing; limitation. Upon the basis of mortality and other tables of experience, and 
regular interest, as the Board of Trustees shall from time to time adopt, the actuary shall annually 
compute the pension reserves for service rendered and to be rendered by members, and the 
pension reserves for pensions being paid retirants and beneficiaries. The pension reserves shall be 
financed by annual contributions to be made by the City; the contribution to be determined in 
accordance with divisions (1), (2), and (3) below; provided, that in no fiscal year shall the City's 
contributions to the retirement system exceed ten percent of the aggregate amount of the 
compensation paid members in the employ of the City in the fiscal year: 
(1) ?For current service: the City's appropriation for members' current service shall be a percent of 
their annual compensations which will equal an amount which, if paid annually by the City 
during the members' future service, will be sufficient to provide at the time of their retirements, 
the difference between the pension reserves for the future service portions of the pensions to be 
paid the members upon their retirements, and the present value of their future net contributions. 
(2) ?For accrued service: the City's appropriation for members' accrued service shall be a percent 
of their annual compensations which will equal an amount which if paid annually by the City 
over a period of years to be determined by the council, will amortize at regular interest the 
unfunded pension reserves for the accrued service portions of the pensions to be paid to 
members upon their retirements. 
(3) ?For pensions being paid: the City's appropriation for pensions being paid retirants and 
beneficiaries shall be a percent of the members' annual compensations which will equal an 
amount which, if paid annually by the City over a period of years to be determined by the 
council, will amortize at regular interest any unfunded pension reserves for pensions being paid 
retirants and beneficiaries. 
(C) ?Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (B) hereof, if in any annual contribution period it is 
actuarially determined that in order to maintain the retirement system on a sound actuarial basis, a 
fiscal year contribution to the system in excess of 15 percent is required (comprised of the City 
contribution of ten percent required by Code § 35-33(B) and the member contribution of five percent 
required by Code § 35-31(B)), then one-half of any required excess contribution that is actuarially 
determined to be necessary shall be made by the City.

Sec. 35-46. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(A) ?General. This division applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding 
any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under 
this division, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have 
any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by 
the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(B) ?Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context 
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by 
the distributee. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse Beneficiary may make a direct rollover only 
to an "inherited" individual retirement account as described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue 
Code. If a non-spouse Beneficiary receives a distribution from the Plan, the distribution is not eligible for a 
60-day (non-direct) rollover. 
    Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or 
former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. Effective as 
of January 1, 2008, an Employee's or former Employee's non-spouse Beneficiary is a distributee with 
regard to the interest of the Employee or former Employee. 
    Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in 
section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, an 
annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the 
Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible 
rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account 
or individual retirement annuity. Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible 
retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue 
Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a 
state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a 
state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. 
    Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of 
the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: 
any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than 
annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) 
of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or 
more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and 
the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income.

meanings ascribed to them respectively. 
(A) ?Actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used for determining the actuarial equivalence of

service on and after October 12, 2014, average monthly earnings means the average of 
earnings for the five best years of the last ten years of continuous service prior to retirement, 
termination or death. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for a member who is employed

be allowed for any unauthorized leave of absence. In the event a member who, while 
employed by the City, entered or enters the armed forces of the United States during any 
period of compulsory military service, and reenters the employ of the City, the armed 
service rendered by him, not to exceed a total of five years, shall be credited him as 
continuous service; provided:

beneficiary by written notice to the board upon forms provided by the board. Upon such change, the 
rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefit under the system shall cease.

Sec. 35-53. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(A) ?Frozen accrued benefit. Notwithstanding any other provision of the System, the accrued benefits of 
all members of this System who are employed and not participating in the DROP on October 12, 
2014 shall be frozen on that date. All such members shall be fully vested in their frozen accrued 
benefit. The value of each member's frozen accrued benefit shall be calculated in accordance with 
the provisions of the System in effect on October 11, 2014, based on the member's continuous 
service and average monthly earnings on that date. The frozen accrued benefit shall be payable to 
the member (or placed in the member's DROP account, if applicable) upon attaining the normal 
retirement date set forth in subsection (B) below; or a reduced benefit shall be payable to the 
member upon attaining the early retirement date set forth in subsection (C) below. Upon retirement 
or entry into the DROP, a member whose accrued benefit is frozen on October 12, 2014 shall be 
eligible for a retirement benefit in two parts: the frozen accrued benefit based on the member's 
continuous service and average monthly earnings on October 12, 2014; and the benefit based on 
the member's continuous service on and after October 12, 2014. The provisions of this subsection 
(A) shall not apply to a member who is employed and within three years of the normal retirement 
date on October 12, 2014. 
(B) ?Normal retirement. For members hired before October 12, 2014, a member's normal retirement 
date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment 
of his/her 55th birthday, and the completion of ten years of continuous service or completion of 20 
years of continuous service regardless of age. For members hired on or after October 12, 2014, a 
member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following 
the earlier of the attainment of his/her 55th birthday, and the completion of ten years of continuous 
service, or the first day of the month coincident with or next following the attainment of his/her 52nd 
birthday, and the completion of twenty-five years of continuous service. Except as provided herein, a 
member may retire on his/her normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter. 
Each member shall become 100 percent vested in his/her accrued benefit on his/her normal 
retirement date. A member's normal retirement benefit shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Duration. A member retiring hereunder on or after his/her normal retirement date shall receive 
a monthly benefit which shall commence on his/her retirement date, and be continued thereafter 
during his/her lifetime, ceasing upon death, but subject in any event to the provision of division 
(G). Other optional forms of payment providing death benefits shall also be available as 
specified herein. 
(2) ?Amount. For members hired before October 12, 2014, the monthly retirement benefit for 
continuous service prior to October 12, 2014 shall be equal to 3.5 percent of average monthly 
earnings multiplied by the number of years and completed months of continuous service; and 
for continuous service on and after October 12, 2014 the monthly retirement benefit shall be 
equal to 3.5 percent of average monthly earnings multiplied by the number of years and 
completed months of continuous service up to twenty years, and 3.0 percent of average 
monthly earnings multiplied by the number of years and completed months of continuous 
service after twenty years. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the monthly retirement 
benefit for members hired before October 12, 2014 shall not exceed 85% of average monthly 
earnings; provided, any member who has accrued a benefit in excess of 85% of average 
monthly earnings on October 12, 2014 shall retain the benefit percentage accrued on that date, 
but shall not accrue any additional benefit percentage thereafter (but in no event shall the 
benefit be less than 2.0 percent for each year of continuous service). The monthly retirement 
benefit for members hired on or after October 12, 2014 shall be equal to 2.5 percent of average 
monthly earnings multiplied by the number of years and completed months of continuous 
service, up to a maximum of 70% of average monthly earnings (but in no event less than 2.0 
percent for each year of continuous service). Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 
(2), the monthly retirement benefit for a member who is employed and within three years of the 
normal retirement date on October 12, 2014 shall be equal to 3.5 percent of average monthly 
earnings multiplied by the number of years and completed months of continuous service. 
(C) ?Early retirement. A member's early retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident 
with or next following attainment of his 50th birthday and the completion of ten years of continuous 
service. Except as provided herein, a member may retire on his early retirement date or on the first 
day of any month thereafter. A member's early retirement benefit shall be as follows: 
(1) ?Duration. A member retiring hereunder on or after his early retirement date shall receive a 
monthly benefit which shall commence on his retirement date, and be continued thereafter 
during his lifetime, ceasing upon death, but subject in any event to the provisions of division (G). 
Other optional forms of payment providing death benefits shall also be available as specified 
herein. 
(2) ?Amount. The monthly retirement benefit shall be computed as described in division (B), taking 
into account the member's continuous service to his date of actual retirement and average 
monthly earnings as of such date, such amount of retirement benefit to be actuarially reduced to 
take into account the member's younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement 
benefits. In no event shall the early retirement reduction exceed three percent for each year by 
which the member's age at retirement preceded the member's normal retirement date. 
(D) ?Disability. 
(1) ?Service-incurred. Any member who receives a service-connected injury, disease, or disability, 
which injury, disease, or disability permanently incapacitates him, physically or mentally from his 
regular and continuous duties as a firefighter or police officer, shall receive in equal monthly 
installments an amount equal to 66 2/3 percent of his earnings in effect as of the date of 
disability. The benefit shall be paid until the recovery from disability as determined by the board, 
or death. An optional form of benefit, providing death benefits, may be elected. 
(2) ?Nonservice-incurred. Any member with ten years of continuous service, who receives a 
nonservice-connected injury, disease, or disability, and which injury, disease, or disability 
permanently incapacitates him physically or mentally from gainful employment, shall receive in 
equal monthly installments an amount equal to his accrued retirement benefit based on his 
average monthly earnings, continuous service, and member contribution rate in effect on the 
date of disability. In no event shall the foregoing benefit be less than 25 percent of the 
member's average monthly earnings as of the date of disability. 
(3) ?Determination of disability. All questions relating to eligibility for initial payment or continuance 
of disability benefits shall be determined by the Board of Trustees, taking into consideration the 
recommendations of the medical board, and based upon the methods and procedures 
established by the Board of Trustees. 
(4) ?Benefit offsets. The City may not offset worker's compensation benefits against an employee's 
pension benefits, except to the extent that the total of the two exceeds the employee's average 
monthly wage. 
(5) ?Exclusions. Disability benefits shall not be payable in cases where the disability arose as a 
result of the member's own willfully intended or self-inflicted injury, intoxication, or use of 
narcotics or other items considered to be dangerous drugs, or by reason of the commission of a 
criminal act. 
(6) ?Recovery. In the event of recovery from disability as determined by the board, and immediate 
reemployment by the City as an employee, the period of time while disabled shall be included 
as continuous service. In the event of recovery, but without immediate reemployment as an 
employee, the member's future benefits shall be determined as though he initially terminated 
employment on his date of disability. 
(7) ?Minimum benefit. Disability benefits shall be subject, in any event, to the provisions of division 
(G) below. 
(E) ?Pre-retirement death. 
(1) ?Service-incurred. A death benefit shall be payable on behalf of any member who dies as a 
direct result of an occurrence arising in the performance of service to the City, as follows: 
(a) ?To the spouse, until the earlier of death or remarriage, a monthly benefit equal to 25 
percent of the member's earnings in effect on his date of death, plus, 
(b) ?For each unmarried child until he or she attains age 18 and for each unmarried child from 
age 18 until age 22 who is a full-time student in a fully accredited high school, college, or 
university, there shall be paid in equal monthly installments an amount equal to seven and 
one-half percent of earnings subject to an overall limitation of a total of 40 percent of 
earnings for the spouse and children combined. The nonstudent child's pension shall 
terminate on the earlier of death, marriage, or the attainment of age 18. The pension of a 
child who is a student shall terminate on the earlier of death, marriage, or the attainment of 
age 22. Legally adopted children shall be as eligible as natural children. 
(c) ?Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the surviving spouse of any member killed 
in the line of duty shall not lose survivor retirement benefits if the spouse remarries. 
(d) ?Upon death or remarriage of the spouse which results in termination of the survivor 
retirement benefits, the seven and one-half percent child allowance shall be increased to 
15 percent for each child, not to exceed a combined total of 30 percent of the member's 
earnings. The trusteeship and method of disbursement of the pension to any child or 
children shall be determined by the Board of Trustees. 
(2) ?Nonservice-incurred. If any member dies while in active service as an employee of the City, but 
from causes not attributable to active duty or service, a death benefit shall be payable as 
follows: 
(a) ?If the member was eligible for normal retirement on his date of death, it shall be assumed 
that the deceased member had retired on his date of death, and a benefit shall be paid on 
a monthly basis, assuming election of an option as follows: 
1. ?If the member was married on his date of death, a 100 percent joint and survivor 
annuity payable to the spouse, unless in lieu thereof, the ten-year certain and life 
thereafter option payable to the designated beneficiary had been elected in writing by 
the member prior to his death. 
2. ?If the member was not married on his date of death, the 10-year certain and life 
thereafter option. 
(b) ?If the member was not eligible for normal retirement on his date of death, the return of 
accumulated contributions. 
(3) ?Minimum benefit. Pre-retirement death benefits shall be subject, in any event, to the provisions 
of division (G) below. 
(F) ?Vesting. 
(1) ?If a member terminates his/her employment with the police department, either voluntarily or by 
lawful discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, he/she shall be 
entitled to the following: 
(a) ?With less than five years of continuous service, refund of accumulated contributions. 
(b) ?With five or more years of continuous service, either: 
1. ?The pension benefit accrued to his date of termination, payable commencing at his 
otherwise earliest normal retirement date, provided he does not elect to withdraw his 
accumulated contributions, and survives to the normal retirement date; or 
2. ?The refund of accumulated contributions. 
(2) ?Any member of this system who, for whatever reason, has his employment with the City as a 
police officer or firefighter terminate, but who remains with or was previously employed by the 
City in some other capacity so that his total period of employment with the City is ten years or 
more, shall have all benefits accrued under this system preserved, provided he does not elect to 
withdraw his accumulated contributions. Accrued benefits shall be payable at his otherwise 
normal retirement date, in accordance with the provisions of this system. For purposes of 
determining normal retirement date under this vesting provision, continuous service shall 
include all continuous employment with the City as an employee as herein defined, as well as 
the period of time subsequent to termination as an actively employed and contributing member 
of this system; provided benefits shall not be payable under this system during any period of 
continued employment by the City. 
(3) ?Forfeitures arising from terminations of employment shall serve only to reduce future required 
contributions. 
(4) ?Payments shall be made pursuant to paragraph (1)(a) above only upon the written request of 
the member in the form and manner determined by the Board. 
(G) ?Minimum benefits. For each member who was also a member of the employee's retirement system 
immediately preceding the effective date of this system, and who had, immediately preceding the 
effective date of this system, a balance standing to his credit in either the firemen state contribution 
fund or the policemen state contribution fund, there shall be minimum benefits payable under this 
system. In no event shall the total of benefits payable from this system to a member, whether by 
reason of normal retirement, disability, or death, be less than the total of (1) plus (2) where: 
(1) ?Equals the balance, including interest, credited to date immediately preceding the effective 
date of this system, in either the firemen state contribution fund or the policemen state 
contribution fund; and 
(2) ?Equals the amount of his accumulated contribution on his date of retirement, disability, or 
death. 
(H) ?Termination of employment. In the event a member leaves the employ of the City, for any reason, 
except his normal retirement, disability, or death, the balance standing to his credit in the state 
contribution fund shall be paid to the member as follows: 
(1) ?Prior to completing three years of service, one-fourth of the amount credited to his account; 
(2) ?Prior to completing six years of service, but after completing three years of service, one-half of 
the amount credited to his account; 
(3) ?Prior to completing nine years of service, but after completing six years of service, three-fourths 
of the amount credited to his account; 
(4) ?After completing nine years of service, the participant shall be entitled to the entire amount 
credited to his account. 
(I) ?Denial of benefits. When the claim of any member or beneficiary for benefits has been denied by the 
board, the board shall submit to the member or beneficiary on a timely basis a written notice setting 
forth the specific reasons for the denial. When a denial has occurred, the member or beneficiary 
shall have the right to a rehearing and a full and fair review by the board regarding the facts, 
circumstances, and information pertaining to the claim and the reasons for its denial. 
(J) ?Limitation on benefits. 
(1) ?In no event may a member's annual benefit exceed the lesser of: 
(a) ?One hundred sixty thousand dollars (adjusted for cost of living in accordance with IRC 
section 415(d), but only for the year in which such adjustment is effective), or 
(b) ?One hundred percent of the member's average annual compensation for the member's 
three highest paid consecutive years; however, benefits of up to $10,000.00 a year can be 
paid without regard to the 100 percent limitation if the total retirement benefits payable to 
an employee under all defined benefit plans (as defined in IRC section 414(j)) maintained 
by the employer for the present and any prior year do not exceed $10,000.00 and the 
employer has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan (as defined in IRC 
section 414(i)) in which the employee was a participant. 
(2) ?If the member has less than ten years of service with the employer (as defined in IRC section 
415(b)(5) and as modified by IRC section 415(b)(6)(D)), the applicable limitation in division (a) 
or division (b) above shall be reduced by multiplying such limitation by a fraction. The numerator 
of such fraction shall be the number of years, or part thereof, of service with the employer; the 
denominator shall be ten years. 
(3) ?For purposes of this division (J), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the 
form of a straight life annuity with no ancillary or incidental benefits and with no employee or 
rollover contributions. To the extent that ancillary benefits are provided, the limits set forth in 
division (J)(1)(a) and (b) above will be reduced actuarially, using an interest rate assumption 
equal to the greater of five percent or the interest rated [rate] used in the most recent annual 
actuarial valuation, to reflect such ancillary benefits. 
(4) ?If distribution of retirement benefits begins before age 62, the dollar limitation as described in 
division (J)(1)(a) shall be reduced actuarially using an interest rate assumption equal to the 
greater of five percent or the interest rate used in the most recent annual actuarial valuation; 
however, for plan years ending on or before December 31, 2001, retirement benefits shall not 
be reduced below $75,000.00 if payment of benefits begins at or after age 55 and not below the 
actuarial equivalent of $75,000.00 if payment of benefits begins before age 55. If retirement 
benefits begin after age 65, the dollar limitation of division (J)(1)(a) shall be increased actuarially 
using an interest assumption equal to the lesser of five percent or the interest rate used in the 
most recent annual actuarial valuation. 
(5) ?For this division (J) the "average annual compensation for a member's three highest paid 
consecutive years" shall mean the member's greatest aggregate compensation during the 
period of three consecutive years in which the individual was an active member of the system. 
(6) ?Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan, the retirement benefit of a member shall be 
reduced to the extent that it exceeds amounts specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue 
Code. 
(K) ?Maximum compensation. In determining the pension benefit for an eligible employee, compensation 
in excess of limitations set forth in § 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be disregarded. 
The limitation on compensation for an eligible employee shall not be less than the amount which was 
allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect July 1, 1993. As used in this section, eligible 
employee is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 
1995. 
(L) ?Deferred retirement option plan ("DROP"). 
(1) ?Eligibility to participate in the DROP. 
(a) ?Any member who is eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit may participate in the 
DROP. Members shall elect to participate by applying to the board on a form provided for 
that purpose. 
(b) ?Plan members who enter the DROP with less than 27 years of service may participate in 
the DROP for up to five years. 
(c) ?Plan members with 27 or more years of service, but less than 35 years of service may 
enter the DROP and participate for up to three years. 
(d) ?Plan members with 35 or more years of service may enter the DROP at any time and 
participate for up to two years. 
(e) ?The following examples are provided for further explanation of the foregoing provisions: 
? Members hired before October 12, 2014 who enter the DROP after 20 years of 
service5 years of DROP participation. 
? Members hired before October 12, 2014 who enter the DROP after 23 years of 
service5 years of DROP participation. 
? 25 years of service5 years of DROP participation. 
? 26 years of service5 years of DROP participation. 
? 27 years of service3 years of DROP participation. 
? 30 years of service3 years of DROP participation. 
? 35 years of service2 years of DROP participation. 
(f) ?Upon a member's election to participate in the DROP, he or she shall cease to be a 
member and shall be precluded from accruing any additional benefits under the pension 
plan. For all pension plan purposes, the DROP participant shall be considered to be 
retired. The amount of continuous service and average monthly earnings freeze as of the 
date of entry into the DROP. 
(2) ?Compliance with Internal Revenue Code Sections 414(k) ad 414(i). To the extent required 
under the Internal Revenue Code, the DROP under the retirement system shall be treated as a 
defined contribution plan to the extent that the member's benefits under the retirement system 
are based on the member's DROP account. The amount of "annual additions" (as such term is 
defined in Section 415(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations Section 
1.415(c)-1(b)) which may be allocated under the DROP to a member's DROP account for a 
"limitation year" may not exceed the maximum permissible member's DROP account under 
Section 415(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-
1(a)(1) (the "Annual Maximum Amount"). For purposes hereof, the term "limitation year" means 
the twelve-month period beginning on October 1. In addition, for purposes of determining a 
member's Annual Maximum Amount, the member's compensation shall be determined in 
compliance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2. 
(M) ?Death Benefits for Death during Qualified Military Service . In the case of a death or disability 
occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a participant dies while performing qualified military service 
(as defined in Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code), the survivors of the participant are 
entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified 
military service) provided under the plan as if the participant had resumed and then terminated 
employment by the City on account of death. 
(N) ?Differential Wage Payments. For years beginning after December 31, 2008, (i) an individual 
receiving a differential wage payment, as defined in Section 3401(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue 
Code, shall be treated as an employee of the employer making the payment, (ii) the differential wage 
payment shall be treated as compensation, and (iii) the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet 
the requirements of any provision described in Section 414(u)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code by 
reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the differential wage payment.

Sec. 35-54. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(A) ?Each member entitled to a normal, service-incurred disability, or vested retirement benefit shall 
have the right, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, to elect to have his 
benefit payable under any one of the options hereinafter set forth in lieu of the benefits otherwise 
provided herein, and to revoke any elections and make a new election at any time prior to the actual 
beginning of payments. The value of optional benefits shall be actuarially equivalent to the value of 
benefits otherwise payable, and the present value of payments to the retiring member must be at 
least equal to 50 percent of the total present value of payments to the retiring member and his 
beneficiary. The member shall make such an election by written request to the board, the request 
being retained in the board's files. 
(B) ?Option 1Joint and last survivor option. The member may elect to receive a reduced benefit during 
his lifetime, and have such benefit (or a designated fraction thereof) continued after his death to and 
during the lifetime of his spouse or a relative other than his spouse. The election of option 1 shall be 
null and void if the designated beneficiary dies before the member's benefit payments commence. 
(C) ?Option 2Ten years certain and life thereafter. The member may elect to receive a benefit with 120 
monthly payments guaranteed. If, after payments commence, the member should die before the 120 
monthly payments are made, payments are then continued to his designated beneficiary until 120 
payments in all have been made, at which time benefits cease. After expiration of the 120 monthly 
payments guaranteed, should the retired member be then alive, payments shall be continued during 
his remaining lifetime. 
(D) ?Option 3Other. In lieu of the other optional forms enumerated in this section benefits may be paid 
in any form approved by the board so long as actuarial equivalence with the benefits otherwise 
payable is maintained. 
(E) ?Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a member's benefits shall commence no later than 
April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which he or she attains age 
70½ or (ii) the calendar year in which he or she retires (the "Required Beginning Date"). All 
distributions from the plan (including the DROP) shall conform to the regulations issued under 
Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, including the incidental death benefit provision of 
Section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, such regulation shall override any plan 
or DROP provision that is inconsistent with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan to the contrary, a form of retirement income payable 
from this plan shall satisfy the following conditions: 
(1) ?If the retirement income is payable before the member's death: 
(a) ?It shall either be distributed or commence to the member not later than April 1 of the 
calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 
70½, or the calendar year in which the member retires; 
(b) ?The distribution shall commence not later than the calendar year defined above; and (i) 
shall be paid over the life of the member or over the lifetimes of the member and spouse, 
issue or dependent, or (ii) shall be paid over the period extending not beyond the life 
expectancy of the member and spouse, issue or dependent. 
Where a form of retirement income payment has commenced in accordance with the preceding 
paragraphs and the member dies before his entire interest in the plan has been distributed, the 
remaining portion of such interest in the plan shall be distributed no less rapidly than under the 
form of distribution in effect at the time of the member's death. 
(2) ?If the member's death occurs before the distribution of his interest in the plan has commenced, 
the member's entire interest in the plan shall be distributed within five years of the member's 
death, unless it is to be distributed in accordance with the following rules: 
(a) ?The member's remaining interest in the plan is payable to his spouse, issue or dependent; 
(b) ?The remaining interest is to be distributed over the life of the spouse, issue or dependent 
or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the spouse, issue or 
dependent; and 
(c) ?Such distribution begins within one year of the member's death unless the member's 
spouse is the sole designated beneficiary, in which case the distribution need not begin 
before the date on which the member would have attained age 70½ and if the member's 
spouse dies before the distribution to the spouse begins, this section shall be applied as if 
the spouse were the member.

Sec. 35-55. - Contributions. 
(A) ?Member contributions. 
(1) ?Amount. Members of the system shall make regular contributions to the fund equal to nine 
percent of their respective earnings. The contribution rate shall be subject to division (C) below. 
The City agrees to assume and pay member contributions in lieu of direct contributions by the 
members, such contributions shall accordingly be paid into the system in behalf of the 
members. The City shall, solely for the purpose of compliance with Section 414(h) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, pick up members contributions required to be made by members on 
earnings paid with respect to payroll periods upon this section becoming effective. No member 
subject to such agreement shall have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts 
directly instead of having them paid by the City directly to the system. All such contributions by 
the City shall be deemed and considered as member accumulated contributions and subject to 
all provisions of this system pertaining to accumulated contributions of members. 
(2) ?Duration. Contributions shall be deducted from earnings before the same are paid, until the 
member terminates his employment, whether by reason of retirement, disability, death, or 
termination. 
(3) ?Interest. Interest shall be credited to member contributions at the rate of four percent per 
annum, on an annual interest crediting date to be established by the board. As of each such 
date, the amount of interest to be credited shall equal four percent of each member's 
accumulated contributions, as of the most recent prior interest-crediting date. 
(4) ?Guaranteed refund. All benefits payable under this system are in lieu of a refund of 
accumulated contributions. However, each member shall be guaranteed the payment of 
benefits on his behalf at least equal in total amount to his accumulated contributions, and as 
otherwise set forth under § 35-53(G) (minimum benefits). 
(B) ?State contributions. Any moneys received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for 
the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for City police and firemen shall be 
deposited in the trust fund comprising part of this system. The City shall not be liable to make up this 
funding in the event it is discontinued. 
(C) ?City contributions. 
(1) ?On behalf of bargaining unit members and nonbargaining unit managerial employees employed 
in that capacity after the adoption of this amended provision. So long as this system is in effect, 
the City shall make an annual contribution to the trust fund in an amount equal to the difference 
in each year as between the total of aggregate member contributions for the year plus state 
contributions for the year, and the total cost for the year as shown by the most recent actuarial 
valuation and report for the system. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total of 
normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to fund the unfunded accrued past service 
liability over a 40-year period, commencing with the fiscal year in which the effective date of this 
system occurs. However, should the combined cost of the City's and the employee's 
contributions in any one year exceed 18 percent of the total budgeted payroll for police officers 
for that year, the excess over 18 percent shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent of 
budgeted payroll, and the resulting excess rate over 18 percent shall be divided in two with 
members paying half the excess and the City paying the other half for that fiscal year. Should 
the combined cost of the City's and the employees' contributions of the total cost in a given 
fiscal year be less than 14 percent of the total budgeted payroll for police officers for that year, 
the difference under 14 percent shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent of budgeted payroll. 
The resulting amount shall be divided in two with members reducing their contribution rates by 
half the difference, and the City reducing its contribution by the remaining half for that fiscal 
year. 
(2) ?On behalf of the grandfathered nonbargaining unit managerial employees. 
(a) ?Non-bargaining unit managerial employees employed in that capacity as to the date of the 
adoption of this amendment to this division of the police retirement system on September 
27, 1993, shall continue to be covered by the provisions of the prior division (included 
hereinafter) as if the same has not been amended. New nonbargaining unit managerial 
employees, becoming employed in that capacity after the adoption of this amendment to 
this division of the police retirement system on September 27, 1993 shall be governed 
and/or continue to be governed by the foregoing provision which shall also cover 
bargaining unit members. 
(b) ?Those police retirement system members grandfathered pursuant to subdivision (a) above 
shall be governed by the following language as to City contributions: 
So long as this system is in effect, the City shall make an annual contribution to the trust 
fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year as between the total of aggregate 
member contributions for the year plus state contributions for the year, and the total cost 
for the year as shown by the most recent actuarial valuation and report for the system. The 
total cost for any year shall be defined as the total of normal cost plus the additional 
amount sufficient to fund the unfunded accrued past service liability over a 40-year period, 
commencing with the fiscal year in which the effective date of this system occurs. 
However, should the City's portion of the total cost for grandfathered members in a given 
fiscal year exceed 23 percent of the total budgeted payroll for police officers for that year, 
the excess over 23 percent shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent of budgeted 
payroll, and the resulting excess rate over 23 percent shall be divided in two with 
grandfathered members paying half the excess and the City paying the other half for that 
fiscal year. Should the City's portion of the total cost in a given fiscal year be less than 23 
percent of the total budgeted payroll for grandfathered police officers for that year, the 
difference under 23 percent shall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent of budgeted 
payroll. The resulting amount shall be divided in two with the grandfathered members 
reducing their contribution rates by half the difference, and the City reducing its contribution 
by the remaining half for that fiscal year. 
(3) ?Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) above, for the plan years beginning October 1, 2017 
through September 30, 2020, the maximum employee contribution calculated in accordance 
with paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall be 12.5 percent. All accumulated excess and annual 
excess Chapter 185 premium tax monies shall be used to fund the reduction in employee 
contributions provided in the preceding sentence, and to the extent that excess Chapter 185 
premium tax revenues are not sufficient to fully fund the reduction, the City's contribution shall 
be increased. Effective October 1, 2020, employee contributions shall be determined in 
accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2) above. 
(D) ?Other. Private donations, gifts, and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but deposits must 
be accounted for separately, and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these 
sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may 
not be used to reduce what would otherwise have been required City contributions.

the City Clerk that he will diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the board, and that he will 
not knowingly violate or willingly permit to be violated any of the provisions of the law applicable to 
the retirement system. The oath shall be subscribed to by the members making it and certified by the

(G) ?Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Three affirmative votes shall be necessary

basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(E) ?The Board of Trustees shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1) ?The Board of Trustees shall be vested with full legal title to the fund, subject, however, to 
the authority and power of the City Council to amend or terminate this trust, provided that 
no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund 
except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system. All 
contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without 
distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or 
its agent in the fund, and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately 
any portion of the fund. 
(2) ?The fund may be invested and reinvested in securities or property, real or personal, 
wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the Board of Trustees,

transferred into its name as trustee, or into the name of the nominee as it may direct, or it 
may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and 
records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the trust fund. 
(6) ?The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities 
of any corporation, association, or trust, and to give general or specific proxies or powers 
of attorney, with or without power of substitution, to participate in mergers, reorganizations, 
recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to the securities; to 
deposit the stock or other securities in any voting trust or any depositories designated 
thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting 
from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally, to exercise any of the powers 
of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments, comprising the fund which 
it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(7) ?The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, 
not to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power herein contained. 
(8) ?Where any action which the board is required to take, or any duty or function which it is 
required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it 
as trustee herein, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a 
member, the City or any other entity of specific information, certification, direction, or 
instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take action or perform such duty 
or function until the information, certification, direction, or instruction has been received by 
it.

Sec. 35-58. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(A) ?Sections 35-5035-59 which establish the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining 
to the system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that 
if §§ 35-5035-59 or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to 
any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any alteration, 
amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby, 
except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(B) ?If §§ 35-5035-59 are repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, the board shall 
continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of §§ 35-5035-59, for the sole 
benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future 
persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided in §§ 35-5035-59 who are 
designated by any of the members. In the event of repeal, or if contributions to the system are 
discontinued, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to the date of repeal, and 
the assets of the system shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a 
proportionate basis to the persons so entitled to benefits in accordance with the provisions hereof, 
with prior preference being directed towards the return of accumulated contributions. 
(C) ?(1) ?The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the 
system upon repeal of §§ 35-5035-59, or if contributions to the system are discontinued: 
(a) ?The accumulated contributions of the members, less any benefits received, in 
proportion to and to the extent of the then amount of accumulated member 
contributions. If any funds remain, then 
(b) ?Members already retired under the normal retirement provisions of the system, and 
those eligible for normal retirement, but not actually retired, and their beneficiaries, in 
proportion to and to the extent of the then actuarially determined present value of the 
benefits payable less amounts received according to division (a) above. If any funds 
remain, then 
(c) ?Members retired under the disability provisions of this system and their beneficiaries 
in the same manner as in division (b) above. If any funds remain, then 
(d) ?All other members and their beneficiaries in the same manner as in division (b), but 
based upon continuous service and average monthly earnings as of the date of 
termination of the system, and with any benefits vested given precedence. 
(2) ?The allocation of the fund provided for in this division may, as decided by the board, be 
carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits 
determined in accordance with this division. The fund may be distributed in one sum to the 
persons entitled to the benefits, or the distribution may be carried out in such other 
equitable manner as the board may direct. The trust may be continued in existence for 
purposes of subsequent distributions. 
(3) ?If, at any time during the first ten years after the effective date of the system as respects 
the City, the system shall be terminated, or the full current costs of the system (consisting 
of the normal costs and interest on any accrued liability) shall not have been met, anything 
in the system to the contrary notwithstanding, City contributions which may be used for the 
benefit of any one of the 25 highest paid employees of the City on the effective date, 
whose anticipated annual retirement allowances provided by the City's contributions at his 
normal retirement date would exceed $1,500.00, shall not exceed the greater of either 
$20,000.00 or an amount computed by multiplying the smaller of $10,000.00 or 20 percent 
of the employee's average annual earnings during his last five years of service by the 
number of years of service since the effective date. In the event that it shall hereafter be 
determined by statute, court decision, ruling by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, or 
otherwise, that the provisions of this division are not then necessary to qualify the system 
under the Internal Revenue Code, this division shall be ineffective without the necessity of 
further amendment of §§ 35-5035-59. 
(D) ?After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid, and after all other 
liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund 
of the City. 
(E) ?No pension provided hereunder shall be assignable or any part of the corpus or income of the fund 
be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of members and their 
beneficiaries and until those liabilities are satisfied, all City contributions will remain in the fund for 
the benefit of the members or beneficiaries in the event the plan is terminated or City contributions 
cease. 
(F) ?USERRA. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, effective as of December 12, 
1994, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be 
provided in accordance with Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 
USERRA, and Chapters 175 and 185, Florida Statutes, as applicable.

examinations required under the provisions of §§ 35-5035-59, shall investigate all essential 
statements or certificates made by or on behalf of a member in connection with an application for 
disability retirement, and shall report in writing to the Board of Trustees its conclusions and 
recommendations upon all matters referred to it. The payment for their services shall be determined 
by the Board of Trustees. 
(B) ?Discharged members. Members entitled to a pension shall not forfeit the same upon dismissal from

(C) ?Nonassignability. No benefit provided for herein shall be assignable or subject to garnishment for 
debt or for other legal process. 
(D) ?Pension validity. The Board of Trustees shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which 
any pension shall heretofore have been granted under any prior or existing law, or shall hereafter be 
granted or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to 
purge the pension rolls of any person heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or 
hereafter granted under §§ 35-5035-59, if the same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal 
for any reason; and to reclassify any pensioner who has heretofore under any prior or existing law, or 
who shall hereafter under §§ 35-5035-59 be erroneously, improperly, or illegally classified. 
(E) ?Incompetents. If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgment of the board, otherwise 
incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due him under the 
system, the board may, unless and until claims shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian 
or committee or such other person, make the payment or any part thereof to the person's spouse, 
children, or other person deemed by the board to have incurred expenses or assumed responsibility 
for the expenses of the person. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of any liability 
under the system for payment. 
(F) ?Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions. 
(1) ?General. This division applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. 
Notwithstanding any provisions of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a 
distributee's election under this division, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner 
prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an 
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2) ?Definitions. 
(a) ?Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any 
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover 
distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal 
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) 
of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the 
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any 
distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; 
but the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. 
(b) ?Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account 
described in section 408(a) of the Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the 
Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust 
described in section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover 
distribution. Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an eligible retirement 
plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal 
Revenue Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code 
which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately 
account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. 
(c) ?Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the 
employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the 
interest of the spouse. Effective as of January 1, 2008, an Employee's or former 
Employee's non-spouse Beneficiary is a distributee with regard to the interest of the 
Employee or former Employee. 
(d) ?Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan 
specified by the distributee. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse Beneficiary may 
make a direct rollover only to an "inherited" individual retirement account as described in 
Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a non-spouse beneficiary receives a 
distribution from the plan, the distribution is not eligible for a "60-day" rollover. 
(3) ?Retiree medical premiums for public safety officers. The system may allow a public safety 
officer to elect a tax free distribution of up to $3,000 annually directly to a retiree medical plan 
for long term care insurance on a pre-tax basis, so long as the public safety officer separates 
from service either at the plan's normal retirement age or due to his or her disability. Insurance 
premiums may be paid for the public safety officer, his spouse or his dependents while he is 
alive, but once he is deceased, the benefit ceases and may not be used by his spouse or 
beneficiaries to pay for their insurance premiums. Insurance premium payments may only be 
made directly to the insurance company. "Public safety officers" include law enforcement 
officers, firefighters, chaplains, rescue crew members or ambulance crew members.

Sec. 35-60. - Share plan. 
(A) ?Share Plan Established: The City of Miami Springs Police Officer Share Plan (hereinafter "Share 
Plan") is hereby established. The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of Chapter 
185, Florida Statutes, and to provide a mechanism to pay required "special benefits" pursuant to

System. The Share Plan shall be administered by the Board of Trustees of the City of Miami Springs 
Police and Firefighters Retirement System (hereinafter the "Pension Fund"). 
(B) ?Rule-Making Authority: The Board of Trustees of the Miami Springs Police and Firefighters 
Retirement System shall be authorized to adopt any rules necessary for the administration of the

bill, the water service to such customer so in arrears shall be discontinued without further notice and 
shall not be reconnected until all past-due sewer bills are paid, together with all disconnection and 
reconnection charges as the City Council may from time to time determine. However, nothing

against and upon the lands and property to which such sewer service has been furnished to the same 
extent and character as a lien for special assessments and until fully paid and discharged, or barred by 
law, shall remain a lien equal in rank and dignity with the liens of City ad valorem taxes and water fees 
and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in, to or against the real 
property involved. Unpaid and delinquent charges, together with all penalties imposed thereon, shall 
remain and constitute a special assessment lien against the real property involved for the period of five 
years from the due date thereof. Such liens for sewer charges and penalties may be enforced by the City 
pursuant to any of the methods provided in F.S.A. §§ 713.50713.78, or in the alternative, foreclosure 
proceedings may be instituted and prosecuted under the provisions of F.S.A. Ch. 173 or the collection

amount of any sewer service charges due hereunder shall be cumulative and not in lieu of the right of the 
City to discontinue water service and/or sewer service to the user or premises involved. 
(Ord. 465, passed 7-29-70) 


Sec. 50-08. - Temporary authorization for septic tank usage. 
(A) ?Intent. This section is specifically enacted as a temporary and limited authorization for the use of 
septic tanks in the City in order to permit the construction, development and renovation of properties 
within the City during the period of the Metropolitan Dade County sewer moratorium originally 
instituted in 1993. 
(B) ?Use, applicability and conditions. Septic tanks may be installed and utilized, on a temporary basis, 
for properties being constructed, developed, or renovated within the City upon the following 
conditions: 
(1) ?The property owner has secured approval from the department of environmental resources 
management (D.E.R.M.) of the county for the use of a septic tank on the said property. 
(2) ?The property owner has complied with all conditions, restrictions and limitation placed on such 
septic tank approval by D.E.R.M.

tanks. 
(4) ?The property owner has complied with all conditions, restrictions and limitations placed an such 
septic tank usage by the City.

connect their property to the City sewer system in accordance with the ordinances in this chapter, 
and any conditions, requirements or procedures specified by the City Public Works Department. 
(D) ?Termination and repeal of section. The terms and conditions of this section shall immediately be of 
no force or effect and shall be automatically repealed upon the conclusion of the moratorium for

ARTICLE II. - SANITARY SEWER CONNECTIONS 


Sec. 50-10. - Title; area of application. 
    Sections 50-1050-20 shall be known as the City sanitary sewer regulations and shall apply to all 
areas of Miami Springs. 
(Ord. 504, passed 1-24-72) 


Sec. 50-11. - Findings. 
    The City finds that many residences and nonresidential buildings in Miami Springs abut streets and 
easements in which sewer mains have been laid. The sewage disposal for the said residences is 
provided by septic tanks. The growing population of Miami Springs, the increasing contamination of 
groundwater, the easy passage of water through the porous rock and subsoil underlying much of Miami 
Springs, particularly in times of heavy rains and high groundwater level, combined with the continued use 
of individual wells and septic tanks, constitutes a danger to the public health of Miami Springs and 
requires the extension of public sewage disposal wherever it is physically feasible. 
(Ord. 504, passed 1-24-72) 


Sec. 50-12. - Required sewer connections. 
    All premises used or intended for human habitation or occupancy including, but not limited to, 
establishments to be used for household or domestic purposes, food processing, food handling, 
restaurant, dairy or bottling processors, public buildings, and places of assembly, or other establishments 
where human wastes may be disposed of, and which abuts a sewage main owned by a sewage utility, 
shall be connected to the sewer main in such manner as to meet the requirements of the South Florida 
Building Code, the Dade County Public Works Manual and the state board of health. A sewer main shall 
be deemed to abut a building or premises if it is located in a street or easement adjoining the land on 
which the building is located and if it traverses one full dimension of the building. 
(Ord. 504, passed 1-24-72) 


Sec. 50-13. - Notice to connect; procedure. 
    If the City Manager finds and determines that buildings subject to the terms of this chapter have not 
been connected to sewer mains of sewer utilities, he shall notify the record owner of the buildings in 
writing and demand that the owner cause the connections to be made by duly licensed contractors or the 
property owner in accordance with the South Florida Building Code within 90 days of the date of service 
of the notice as hereinafter provided. The notice shall be served by registered mail, addressed to the 
owner or owners of the property described as they are known to the City Manager or as their names and 
addresses are shown upon the records of the county tax assessor or other public records of the county, 
and shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail 
with proper postage prepaid. In the event that such notice is returned by postal authorities, the City 
Manager shall cause a copy of the notice to be served by a law enforcement officer upon the occupant of 
the land or upon any agent of the owner thereof. In the event that personal service upon the occupant of 
the land or upon any agent of the owner thereof cannot be performed after reasonable search by a law 
enforcement officer the notice shall be served by physical posting on the said property, and by publication 
in a newspaper of general circulation at least twice, seven days between publications, and 90 days before 
the date of connection is required. The notice shall be in substantially the following form: 
NOTICE REQUIRING CONNECTION TO SEWER MAIN 
Name of Owner _____ 
Address of Owner _____ 
Our records indicate that you are the owner(s) of the following land in Miami Springs, Florida:  
(describe property) 
An inspection of this land discloses, and I have found and determined, that a building is located

or description of easement) abutting the said property. 
You are hereby notified that unless the said building is connected to the said sewer main within 
90 days of personal service upon you, or of the second publication hereof, Miami Springs will 
proceed to effect said connection and the cost of the work, including advertising costs, 
connection charges and other expenses necessary to make complete connection to building, 
will be imposed as a lien on the land if not otherwise paid within 90 days after said connection 
has been made and the cost thereof ascertained by Miami Springs.

Sec. 50-14. - Connection effected by City lien; recording; redemption. 
(A) ?If within 90 days after service of the notice or physical posting of the notice on the property, or 
publication of the notice in a newspaper, all as set forth in the preceding section, the connection 
required thereby has not been effected, the City Manager shall cause the connection to be effected 
by the City at the expense of the property owners. The cost of the connection shall constitute a lien 
upon the real estate served thereby as is hereinafter set out. 
(B) ?Upon ordering a connection to be made by the City, the City Manager shall cause to be recorded in 
the public records a notice of sewer connection lien pending, which shall include a description of the 
property and a statement that a connection has been ordered, the cost of which shall under this 
paragraph constitute a lien. The notice of sewer connection lien shall, eight months after the date 
thereof, be null and void and constitute no record notice of a pending lien. 
(C) ?After causing the connection to be effected, the City Manager shall certify to the finance department 
the expenses, including such connection charges as may have been approved by the appropriate 
Miami Springs agency, incurred in effecting the connection and shall include a copy of the notice 
above described, whereupon such expense shall become payable within 90 days, after which a 
special assessment lien and charge will be made upon the property, which shall be payable in ten 
equal annual installments together with costs of recording of all documents required to be recorded 
hereby and with interest at the rate of six percent per annum on the unpaid balance from the date of 
such certification until paid. However, the lien may be satisfied at any time by the payment of the 
entire sum due plus accrued interest, recordation costs, and such expenses and penalties as may 
result from the advertisement and sale of certificates for delinquent liens as hereinafter set out. 
(D) ?The finance department shall file for record a notice of such lien in the office of the clerk of the 
circuit court, and shall keep complete records relating to the amount payable thereon. One-tenth of 
the amount of liens accruing during any year ending on June 1, shall be billed and mailed in the fall 
of the same year to the owners of land subject to such liens at the same time as tax statements for 
ad valorem taxes are mailed, and if the same amount shall not be paid on or before April 1 of the 
following year, the entire lien and all annual installments thereof shall be delinquent, overdue, and in 
default, and the entire amount of the lien shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent taxes 
by advertisement and sale of certificates. Upon full payments of liens provided hereby or tax sale 
certificates resulting therefrom the finance department shall, by appropriate means, evidence the 
satisfaction and cancellation of such lien upon the public records. The cost of recordation of the 
notice of sewer connection lien pending, the notice of lien and the satisfaction of lien shall be 
secured by the lien hereby provided. 
(Ord. 504, passed 1-24-72) 


Sec. 50-15. - Exceptions. 
    Any owner of property who receives a notice to connect and who would be required to pay a 
connection charge to a utility, in accordance with tariffs filed with the City may petition the City for an 
exception from the connection requirement of this chapter. Any owner of property who received a notice 
to connect and who would be required to pay a connection charge to the City, in the case of a City-owned 
utility system, in accordance with the tariffs established by the City, may petition the authority for an 
exception from the connection requirements of this section. If the authority finds that the connection 
charge is not just and reasonable, it shall grant an exception from the connection requirements. However, 
the exception shall not conflict with any findings or orders of the department of health and rehabilitative 
services, the state department of air and water pollution control, and/or the county pollution control 
department. Service lines are the responsibility of property owners and the costs thereof shall not be 
considered by this authority in granting these exceptions. 
(Ord. 504, passed 1-24-72)

Sec. 50-17. - Unimproved property. 
(A) ?All parcels of property or portions thereof, not connected to the sanitary sewer system, but abutting 
thereto, shall be subject to an assessment computed to defray debt services and costs of 
administration, of the sanitary sewer system from the time the sanitary sewer system is determined 
to be operative until the date the unimproved benefitted property is connected to the sanitary sewer 
system. The rate of assessment shall be on a yearly basis. 
(B) ?The City Manager shall determine the estimated costs of annual debt service and cost of 
administration of the sanitary sewer system of the City and the cost of the debt service and 
administration to be borne by unimproved property benefitted by the sanitary sewer system. The City 
Manager shall thereafter establish an equitable formula reflecting property value differences among 
the designated categories of City property, to wit: single-family residentially zoned property; 
multifamily residentially zoned property; and commercially zoned property, by determining the mean 
per square foot market valuation of the property within the City as determined by the tax assessment 
of these properties and thereafter apply the valuation factor to the square foot percentage in order to 
determine a weighted proportion for each unimproved property within these zoning classifications 
which shall then be assessed for debt services. 
(C) ?Parking lots shall be considered as unimproved property and shall not be interpreted as off-street 
parking in conjunction with another zoning classification. 
(D) ?Property subject to the foregoing assessment shall not be eligible for a building permit or for a 
change of zoning or for a variance, nor shall there be any improvements placed upon the property 
until such time as assessments above established have been discharged by payment to the City. 
(E) ?The City Manager shall cause to be prepared and filed with the City Clerk an assessment plat 
showing the lands to be assessed, a statement of the annual debt service, and costs of 
administration and a statement of all moneys previously received by the City from unimproved 
properties benefitted by the imposition of an assessment to defray the costs of debt services and 
administration. A resolution declaring the necessity for providing for defraying the costs of debt 
services and administration relating to the sanitary sewer system of the City, shall thereafter be 
published once a week for a period of two weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published 
within the City together with a notice of public hearing upon said resolution, the assessment roll, 
assessment plat, and statement of payment of prior assessments relating thereto. 
(F) ?The public hearing and subsequent procedure relating to the said assessment shall follow as 
closely as possible the procedures and requirements for assessments set forth in F.S.A. Ch. 170. 
(G) ?The City Council shall establish a date certain whereby the owners of properties to be assessed 
and any other persons interested therein may appear before the City Council to be heard as to the 
propriety and advisability of making the aforementioned assessments, the total cost thereof, the 
amount and manner of payment therefore, and as to the amount thereof to be assessed against 
each property benefitted by the sanitary sewer system. At that time and place the City Council shall 
sit as a board of equalization to consider any and all complaints as to these assessments and shall 
adjust and equalize the assessments on the basis of justice and right, and when so equalized and 
approved by resolution of the City Council, the assessment shall stand confirmed and constitute 
legal and binding first liens upon the properties against which the assessments have been levied 
until the assessments are paid. 
(H) ?The assessment shall be paid by the specifically benefitted property designated in the resolution 
annually in such amounts as may be determined in accordance with the methods set forth above. 
The assessments shall remain a lien coequal with the liens of other taxes, superior in dignity to all 
other liens and claims until paid and shall bear interest, if unpaid, after a period of one year at a rate 
of seven and one-half percent per annum. Upon failure of any property owner to pay any annual 
installment as due, the City may cause to be brought necessary legal proceedings to enforce 
payment thereof pursuant to F.S.A. Ch. 170. 
(Ord. 504, passed 1-24-72; amend. Ord. 568, passed 10-14-74; amend. Ord. 574, passed 10-13-
75; amend. Ord. 589-76, passed 8-23-76) 


Sec. 50-18. - Stay of collection of assessment. 
    Assessments of unimproved properties provided herein shall constitute a continuing lien against all 
lots or parcels of land benefitted thereby. The City recognizes from time to time that the owners of certain 
unimproved lots which cannot comply with existing zoning requirements or which are used in connection 
with existing uses and are not intended by the owners to be developed nor utilize the benefits of the 
sewer system to the same extent as lots which are immediately available for building or construction. The 
owners of these lands may by petition apply to the City Manager to stay collection of the assessments 
until such time as the lots may be permitted to be utilized by the City. A petition if granted shall cause the 
collection of the sewer assessments to be stayed as to yearly collection procedures only until the owners 
of the lots seek the benefits of the sewer system, in which event all yearly assessments heretofore levied 
against the lots shall be paid in full with interest as hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 591-76, passed 12-13-76) 


Sec. 50-19. - Lots eligible for stay of collection of assessment. 
    The following unimproved lots shall be eligible for stay of collection of assessment: 
(A) ?Those unimproved platted lots abutting an improved platted lot where unity of title exists and 
said lot is used in connection with the improved lot. 
(B) ?Those unimproved platted lots which failed to comply with the minimum square footage or front 
footage requirements of the zoning code. 
(Ord. 591-76, passed 12-13-76) 


Sec. 50-20. - Procedure for obtaining stay of collection of assessment. 
    The following procedure shall govern all requests for stay of collection of assessment. 
(A) ?The owner of an unimproved platted lot qualifying for stay of collection of assessment may 
petition the City Manager by filing a petition under oath setting forth the following: 
(1) ?The name and address of the owner and legal description of the unimproved lot. 
(2) ?All liens and encumbrances and the names and addresses of all persons holding any liens 
or encumbrances against said property or lot. 
(3) ?A copy of a plat showing the dimensions of the lot. 
(4) ?A recordable covenant in a form to be approved by the City Attorney, executed by all 
persons or corporations claiming an interest in the lot and acknowledging the validity and 
the continuing nature of the assessment lien imposed upon the lots. 
(B) ?The covenant shall contain the following agreements: 
(1) ?Where the unimproved platted lot abuts an improved platted lot and there is unity of title, 
the owner agrees that the assessments and accumulated interest for each year levied 
against the unimproved platted lot shall become due and payable in the event the 
ownership of the lot is conveyed to another party or in the event an application for building 
permit is sought. 
(2) ?Where an unimproved platted lot fails to comply with the minimum square footage or front 
footage requirements of the zoning code and the owner of the lot seeks to obtain a 
variance permitting the development or other use of the land, or in the event the owner 
seeks a building permit permitting the development of said land, the owner agrees that the 
assessments and accumulated interest for each year shall become due and payable. 
(C) ?The City Manager upon approval of the relief sought by the petition shall notify the City Council 
at any regular or special meeting and shall thereafter cause the covenant to be recorded in the 
manner as required for deeds under law. In the event the City Manager denies the relief sought 
by the petition, the petitioner shall have the right to appeal to the City Council within the time 
and in the same manner as permitted for appeals from a denial of relief by the Zoning and 
Planning Board.

Sec. 51-02. - Use of the public sewer system. 
(A) ?It is the purpose of this section to establish rules and regulations concerning discharges to the 
system, including the determination of the acceptability or unacceptability of discharges, the 
pretreatment of discharges, and the establishment of specific limitations on certain discharges. 
(B) ?The director of public works shall determine the acceptability or unacceptability of any discharge to 
the sewer system. Such a determination shall be made on the basis of sound engineering and 
operational evaluations taking into consideration the nature and concentration of the discharge, its 
point of entry into the system, its compatibility with other discharges in the system, its compatibility 
with the treatment facility receiving it, and all other factors pertinent to the effect of the discharge on 
any part of the system or treatment process. 
(C) ?Unacceptable discharges shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, those which have been 
determined by the City to: 
(1) ?Contain materials or substances which would constitute a hazard to life and limb of personnel 
engaged in inspection, maintenance, and operation of the system. 
(2) ?Contain materials or substances which are toxic as defined in these regulations. 
(3) ?Contain materials or substances which are in any way deleterious to any part of the system. 
(4) ?Contain a concentration of any toxic or deleterious materials or substances in excess of any 
limits set thereon in accordance with these regulations. 
(5) ?Cause the City or authority to incur excessive expense in the handling or treatment thereof. 
(6) ?Be incompatible with the treatment process or inhibit the performance of the treatment process 
at the sewage treatment plant. 
(7) ?Be of such volume or contain such B.O.D., suspended solids, or other material load which 
could cause the transmission or treatment facility to exceed its design capabilities. 
(8) ?Cause a treatment facility of the authority to fail to meet effluent requirements set by state and 
federal regulatory agencies or cause such effluent to have a degrading effect on the receiving 
body of water. 
(9) ?Contain viable pathogenic organisms in such quantities as to be a hazard to public health. 
(10) ?Cause a treatment facility of the authority to fail to meet effluent requirements as established 
under the authority's operating permit for its sewage treatment plants. 
(D) ?The City may refuse the service of the City's sewer system to any person whose discharge is 
determined by the City to be unacceptable in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(E) ?Any person whose discharge has been determined by the City to be unacceptable in accordance 
with the provisions of this chapter may apply to the City for permission to pretreat such discharge by 
the use of a method of pretreatment designed to render the discharge acceptable. 
(F) ?The acceptability of a pretreatment method for any given discharge, an application for which has 
been made in accordance with these regulations and the terms for the installation and use thereof, 
shall be reviewed by the City. The review shall be made on the basis of sound engineering and 
operational evaluations taking into consideration all factors pertinent to the effect of the discharge, 
both before and after pretreatment, on any part of the system. 
(G) ?Pretreatment facilities shall at all times be subject to inspection by the director in order to determine 
if such facilities are efficiently performing the function for which they are installed. 
(H) ?All costs incident to pretreatment and all expenses incident to the acquisition, installation, operation, 
maintenance, and repair of pretreatment facilities shall be borne by the user. In addition, any 
extraordinary administrative or investigative expenses incurred by the City as a result of the

in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the sewage works such as, but not 
limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, 
wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair, and fleshings, entrails, plastic or 
paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders. 
(4) ?Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases in sufficient 
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage 
treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, capable 
of preventing entry into sewers for their maintenance and repair (decomposition products of 
normal sewage excepted), or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the authority's 
sewage treatment plant, including but not limited to cyanides in excess of two mg/l as CN in the 
wastes as discharged to the public sewer, and ten mg/l for hydrogen sulfides by weight in 
sewage. 
(5) ?Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5, or higher than 8.5, or having any other 
corrosive property apt to cause damage or hazard to structures, equipment of the sewer

(b) ?Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs. 
(9) ?Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by 
the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amendable to treatment only to such degree 
that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having 
jurisdiction over discharge to the public sewer system. 
(K) ?If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewer 
system, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in division 
(J), and which in the judgment of the director of public works, may have a deleterious effect on the 
sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life 
or constitute a public nuisance, the director of public works may: 
(1) ?Reject the wastes; 
(2) ?Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewer system; 
(3) ?Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
(4) ?Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by 
existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of division (R). If the director of public 
works permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the 
plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the director of public works, 
and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws, and the approval 
of the authority. 
(L) ?It shall at all times be the responsibility of the owner to eliminate or control the emission of offensive 
odors from building sewers to the sewer system or the development of offensive odors in the system

ARTICLE II. - BACKFLOW PREVENTION 


Sec. 52-20. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly 
indicates or requires a different meaning. 
    Air gap separation. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the 
lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and 
the flood level rim of the receptacle, and shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe 
measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case shall the gap be less than one inch. 
    Auxiliary supply. Any water source or system, other than the public water supply, that may be 
available in the building or premises. 
    Backflow. The flow other than the intended direction of flow, or any foreign liquids, gases, or 
substances into the distribution system of a public water supply. 
    Backflow prevention device. A device to counteract back pressures or prevent back siphonage. 
    Back pressure. Backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or other means that could create 
pressure within the system greater than the supply pressure. 
    Back siphonage. A form of backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric pressure within a water 
system. 
    Cross connection. Any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is connected, directly or 
indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage, reservoir, plumbing 
fixture, or other device which contains, or may contain, contaminated water, sewage, or other waste or 
liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water 
supply as a result of backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or 
change-over devices, and other temporary or permanent devices through which, or because of which, 
backflow could occur are considered to be cross connections. 
    Double check valve assembly. An assembly composed of two single, independently acting check 
valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable 
connections for testing the watertightness of each check valve. 
    Public water supply. Any system or water supply intended or used for human consumption of other 
domestic uses, including source, treatment, storage, transmission, and distribution facilities where water 
is furnished to any community, collection, or number of individuals, or is made available to the public for 
human consumption or domestic use, but excluding water supplies serving one single-family residence. 
    Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. A device incorporating two or more check 
valves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two checks, two shutoff 
valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the 
pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between 
the check valves shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve the 
differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. 
When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the 
atmosphere thereby providing an air-gap in the device. 
(Ord. 691-84, passed 2-27-84)

(6) ?Removal of any tree which has been destroyed or effectively destroyed by an act of God, 
or by acts outside the control of the legal, beneficial or equitable owner of the real property 
in which the tree is located, and which acts could not have been prevented by the exercise 
of reasonable care. 
(7) ?Removal of any tree by the City in accordance with the authority and administrative 
discretion provided in § 54-08 of this chapter. 
(8) ?Removal of specimen or non-specimen mango and avocado trees. 
(C) ?All of the aforesaid trees listed in division (B) of this section which are dead or effectively 
destroyed, shall be removed by the property owner, without any permit, relocation, replacement 
or mitigation requirement, so as to protect adjacent properties from damage that may be caused 
by the dead or effectively destroyed trees. 
(D) ?Application for removal permits. Tree removal permits are required for the removal of any 
specimen tree not specifically exempted under division (B) of this section. The City shall provide 
permit application forms which shall be used by permit applicants. An owner, agent of the 
owner, or lessee of a property may apply for a tree removal permit. If the permit applicant is a 
lessee, or agent of the owner, a statement from the owner of the property, indicating that the 
owner has no objection to the proposed tree removal, shall be submitted with the application. 
The permit applicant shall submit to the City a completed application form which shall include 
the reasons for the requested removal, the tree size and tree caliper, and the common name of 
the tree to be removed. Permit application forms shall be accompanied by two diagrams 
showing the location of the tree to be removed which are subject to review and approval by the 
Building and Zoning Department. The diagrams shall include the locations of all existing tree 
resources and all proposed structures or utilities which may require removal or relocation of 
trees. If the submitted diagrams do not provide sufficient information to determine which trees 
will be affected by proposed development, the department may require that a tree survey of the 
site be prepared and submitted to the department for review. 
(E) ?Permit fees. The City shall, by resolution, establish a fee schedule for all matters relating to 
tree removal, relocation, replacement, monetary contribution, and all administrative reviews 
necessitated thereby. 
(F) ?Review and evaluations of removal permit applications. A review of each completed tree 
removal permit application shall be conducted by the Public Works Department. This review and 
all actions taken by the department shall be conducted under a standard of reasonableness 
using the best available practices from biology, botany, forestry, landscape architecture and 
other relevant fields. 
(1) ?Specimen trees standards. 
(a) ?Specimen trees application. Specimen trees shall be preserved whenever reasonably 
possible. Upon receipt of an application to remove a specimen tree, the department 
shall consider the following factors in evaluating said application. 
1. ?Size and configuration of the property. 
2. ?Size and configuration of any proposed development. 
3. ?Location of the tree relative to any proposed development. 
4. ?Whether or not the tree can be preserved under the proposed plan or any 
alternative plan. 
5. ?Health, condition and aesthetic qualities of the tree. 
6. ?Whether the tree poses a threat to persons or property. 
(b) ?Alternate plans. If, upon review of the aforesaid factors, the department determines 
that a specimen tree cannot reasonably be preserved under the proposed plan, then 
the applicant shall provide an alternate plan which shall include preservation of the 
specimen tree and design alterations consistent with the scope and intent of the 
initially proposed plan. Alterations consistent with the scope and intent of the initially 
proposed plan may include, but shall not be limited to: 
1. ?An adjustment of building orientation on a site. 
2. ?An adjustment of lot lines within a site proposal for more than one lot when said 
adjustment will not cause an unreasonable loss of usable space. An applicant 
shall have the burden of proof in the determination of what constitutes an 
unreasonable loss of usable space. 
(c) ?Specimen tree relocation. If preservation of the specimen tree and any alternate 
design consistent with the scope and intent of the initial plan are mutually exclusive, 
then the department may issue a permit to relocate the specimen tree. If the tree 
removal permit requires relocation, then the applicant shall be required to relocate the 
tree in a manner that will maintain the canopy within the general vicinity of the removal 
on the same property or to relocate the tree to a location within the City designated by 
the Public Works Department. 
(d) ?Removal of specimen trees. If relocation of the specimen tree is not feasible, due to 
the size, health, location, species or any other factor, then a permit may be issued for 
removal, and tree replacement shall be required. The Public Works Department shall 
designate an equivalent replacement tree or trees and a location within the city for its 
planting. 
(e) ?Replacement requirements for specimen trees. In the event that replacement is not 
feasible on-site, then alternative off-site replacement shall be required, or, as a last 
alternative, there shall be a contribution made to the City tree trust fund for the full 
equivalent value of the replacement tree or trees. This trust fund shall be administered 
by the City Council so as to insure the prompt planting of replacement trees in an area 
as closely adjacent as is reasonably possible to the area from which a specimen tree 
was properly removed. 
(f) ?Black olive tree removal and replacement. The following policies, standards, and 
requirements shall be applicable to the removal and replacement of black olive trees 
in the City. 
1. ?Private property removal. If a property owner wishes to remove a black olive tree 
from a private property site, the existing tree removal procedures in this 
ordinance must be followed. Mitigation will be in accordance with existing rules 
and standards if the tree is not causing damage to the subject property. 
However, the amount of mitigation required may be reduced by one-half if, in the 
sole discretion of the Public Works Department, the subject tree is causing 
damage to the subject property. In all cases, the property owner shall bear the 
full cost of removal and disposal of the removed tree. As a condition of removal, 
the property owner and the City must reach an agreement for the replacement of 
the removed black olive tree with a City approved tree or for the payment of the 
required mitigation amount into the City Tree Fund prior to the removal of the 
specimen tree. 
2. ?Public property removal. If a property owner requests the removal of a black olive 
tree from the City swale or right-of-way property, the decision regarding the 
removal shall be at the sole and exclusive discretion of the Public Works 
Department. If removal is permitted, the City shall pay for the cost of removal and 
disposal of the removed tree, and the adjacent property owner shall be required 
to pay one-half of the required mitigation for the removed tree prior to the 
removal of the tree. In addition to the foregoing, the established policy of the City 
in regard to the removal of black olive trees from public property mandates that 
no more than 20 such trees shall be removed during any fiscal year of the City 
and that the City will replace all removed trees during its annual Black Olive Tree 
Replacement Program. 
(g) ?Exemption from relocation replacement and contribution requirements. An applicant 
may be exempt from the relocation, replacement and contributions previously set forth 
herein under the following conditions: 
1. ?Subject to the review and approval of the City Public Works Department, and 
upon the submittal of a statement from a landscape architect registered in the 
state, or from an accredited graduate forester, which indicates that a specimen 
tree, due to disease, condition, growth habit or any other reasonable botanical 
factor, does not provide the aesthetic or environmental contribution associated 
with the specimen tree. Said statement shall include the specific reason(s) for the 
claimed exemption. 
2. ?When preservation of the specimen tree would cause an unreasonable risk to 
existing property. 
3. ?When a site contains more than one specimen tree, and 50 percent or more of 
the existing specimen trees and at least 50 percent of the existing specimen tree 
canopy area is preserved. 
4. ?When a specimen tree is determined by the Public Works Department to be 
undesirably located or that it may pose a threat to other adjacent specimen trees. 
(2) ?Compliance. If the application for a tree removal permit is filed in conjunction with the 
construction and development of real property within the City, no Certificate of Occupancy 
shall be provided to the subject property until all applicable provisions of this chapter have 
been met. 
(G) ?Tree protection requirements during construction. During site development, protection 
requirements for trees designated for preservation shall include, but not be limited to, the 
following: 
(1) ?Protective barriers shall be placed around each tree, cluster of trees, or the edge of the 
preservation area no less than six feet (in radius) from the trunk of any protected tree 
cluster or preservation area unless a lesser distance is specified by the Public Works 
Department. Protective barriers shall be a minimum of four feet above ground level and 
shall be constructed of wood, plastic or metal, and shall remain in place until development 
is completed and the Public Works Department has authorized their removal. Protective 
barriers shall be in place prior to the start of any construction. 
(2) ?Understory plants within protective barriers shall be protected. 
(3) ?No oil, fill, equipment, building materials or building debris shall be placed within the areas 
surrounded by protective barriers, nor shall there be disposal of any waste materials such 
as paints, oils, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or any other materials harmful to trees or 
understory plants within the areas surrounded by protective barriers. 
(4) ?Trees shall be braced in such a fashion as to not scar, penetrate, perforate or otherwise 
inflict damage to the tree. 
(5) ?Natural grade shall be maintained within protective barriers. In the event that the natural 
grade of the site is changed as a result of site development, such that the safety of the tree 
may be endangered, tree wells or retaining walls are required. 
(6) ?Underground utility lines shall be placed outside the areas surrounded by protective 
barriers. If said placement is not possible, disturbance shall be minimized by using 
techniques such as tunnelling. 
(7) ?Fences and walls shall be constructed to avoid disturbance to any protected tree. Post 
holes and trenches located close to trees shall be dug by hand and adjusted as necessary, 
using techniques such as discontinuous footings, to avoid damage to major roots. 
(H) ?Tree relocation standards. The relocation of any tree shall be consistent with the following 
minimum standards: 
(1) ?Trees other than palms: 
(a) ?Tree roots shall be severed in such a manner as to provide a root ball which is 
sufficient to ensure survival of the tree when relocated. A sufficiently-sized planting 
hole shall be provided at the relocation site to ensure successful regrowth. 
(b) ?After root severing, adequate time shall be allowed prior to replanting to ensure 
survival of the tree(s). After root severing and prior to relocation, tree(s), shall be 
watered a minimum of twice weekly. After relocation, tree(s) shall be watered a 
minimum of four times each week until the tree(s) are established. 
(c) ?During removal and transportation of the tree, the root ball and vegetative portion of 
the tree shall be protected from damage from wind or injury. Any tree that dies or 
becomes nonviable within 12 months of relocation shall be replaced. 
(2) ?Palm trees. 
(a) ?A ball of earth at least one foot from the base of the tree shall be moved with the tree. 
(b) ?All fronds on Sable Palms shall be trimmed around the bud prior to relocation. 
(c) ?The bud shall be protected from damage or injury during relocation. 
(d) ?Any palm that dies or becomes nonviable within 12 months of relocation shall be 
replaced.

residential recycling program for the City in which all multifamily residential establishments located in 
the City shall be required to participate.

recycling contract with a private recycling company prior to the effective date of this section shall be 
excepted from the requirements hereof. However, upon the expiration of any existing private

option that may exist in the private contract, the multifamily residential establishment shall then be 
immediately required to begin participation in the City program established by this chapter. 
(F) ?Designation of program directors. The City public works department director shall be responsible for

on such property, except the liens for state, county and municipal taxes, and shall be on a parity

amended) for any violations of the program established by this section.

Sec. 97-16. - Levy of tax; schedule; duty of seller. 
    There is levied and imposed upon each and every purchase of electricity, metered gas, bottled gas, 
fuel oil, and telephone service, included in or reflected by any bill rendered by the seller to the purchaser, 
an excise tax the amount of which shall be determined and computed in accordance with the following 
schedules: 
(A) ?Schedule A. To be used when the seller, in accordance with his rules and regulations, renders 
a bill monthly or oftener to the purchaser to cover purchases made during the period of time to 
which the bill is applicable. The amount of excise tax shall be: 
(1) ?Ten percent of the first $25.00 of the total amount, exclusive of governmental charges and 
taxes, shown on any such bill as being due and payable on account of such purchases, 
plus 
(2) ?Five percent of the next $50.00 of such total amount, plus 
(3) ?One percent of any sum in excess of $75.00 of such total amount. 
(B) ?Schedule B. To be used when the seller, in accordance with his rules and regulations, renders 
a bill bimonthly, quarterly, or otherwise less frequently than monthly, to cover purchases made 
during the period of time to which the bill is applicable. 
(1) ?The seller shall determine what part of the total amount, exclusive of governmental 
charges and taxes, shown on any such bill as being due and payable on account of such 
purchase is, under his rules and regulations, attributable to the purchases made during 
each of the monthly periods included within the total period of time covered by such bill; 
(2) ?Compute the amount of excise tax hereunder attributable to each such part of the total 
amount, as so determined, by employing, with respect to each such part, the method and 
procedure described in (A) above for monthly bills; 
(3) ?The total amount of excise tax payable hereunder on account of any such bill shall be the 
arithmetical sum of all of the amounts of excise tax resulting from the computations made 
with respect to each such part as hereinbefore provided. 
(C) ?In the use and application of the foregoing schedules purchases of electricity, metered gas, 
bottled gas, telephone and telegraph services, and water services shall be considered and 
treated as constituting and being distinct and unrelated classes of purchases. In the event that 
more than one such class shall be shown upon the same bill, the amount of excise tax payable 
hereunder shall be determined and computed for each such class separately. The seller is 
required and it shall be his duty hereunder to render to each purchaser bills covering all such 
purchases made. The amount of such excise tax shall be entered and shown by the seller as a 
separate item on each such bill and shall become due and payable to the City whenever such 
bill becomes due and payable under the rules and regulations of the seller. Each such bill shall 
include purchases applicable to but one location, or to but one family or business where more 
than one family or business uses separate metered services at one location in the City. The 
purchaser is required and it shall be his duty hereunder to pay such excise tax to the seller, as 
agent for the City, at the time of the payment of each such bill. In the event that the purchaser 
shall fail, neglect, or refuse to pay such excise tax to the seller when such bill becomes due and 
payable, the seller is empowered to discontinue forthwith to make any further sales or to render 
any further service to the purchaser until the total amount, including such excise tax, shown 
upon such bill shall have been paid in full. The seller is authorized and required and it shall be 
his duty hereunder to collect such excise tax from such purchaser at the time of the payment of 
each such bill and to remit the same to the City Clerk in accordance with the provisions of § 97-
17. However, the seller shall have the right and privilege of assuming and paying such excise 
tax himself in lieu of collecting the same from the purchaser. Further, whenever the seller shall 
fail or neglect to collect such excise tax from the purchaser as hereinbefore provided, the seller 
shall be deemed to have assumed such excise tax himself and shall thereupon become liable 
for the payment of the amount thereof to the City to the same extent as if such excise tax had 
been collected from the purchaser. 
(D) ?In lieu and substitution of the excise tax collected under (A) above, the City shall, beginning 
with September 1, 1973, levy and impose upon each and any purchase of electricity, metered 
gas, bottled gas, telephone and telegraph service, and water service an excise tax equal to ten 
percent of the total amount, exclusive of governmental charges and taxes, shown on any bill as 
being due and payable on account of such purchase. 
(E) ?This section shall not apply to those specifically exempt from the payment of the tax by section 
167.431, Florida Statutes, the sale of fuel oil or natural gas to a public or private utility, either for 
resale or for use as fuel in the generation of electricity.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL REGULATIONS 


Sec. 99-01. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed 
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Ambient noise level means the sound pressure level of the all-encompassing noise emanating from 
a given environment, usually being a composite of sounds from many sources including the source of 
interest. 
    ANSI means the American National Standards Institute. 
    ASTM means the American Society for Testing and Materials. 
    A-Weighted Equivalent Sound Pressure Level (LAeq) means a sound level descriptor based on the 
average sound pressure level in a specified time period. LAeq is intended as a single number indicator to 
describe the sound pressure level of a sound that varies over a specified period of time. LAeq is 
measured in decibels and must be A-weighted (dBA). The minimum measurement time for this regulation 
is defined as two minutes. 
    Background noise level means the sound pressure level of the noise in a given environment without 
the source of interest. 
    Commercial neighborhood means the various commercial and mixed-use zoning districts specified in 
Chapter 150 of this Code of Ordinance, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, 
Neighborhood Business District, Central Business District, B-3 Arterial Business District, Professional 
Office District, Airport Golf District, NW 36th District, and Abraham Tract District. 
    Construction noise means noise resulting from construction, demolition, maintenance, additions, 
alterations or repairs to structures or buildings. 
    Continuous sound shall mean a sound the intensity of which remains relatively constant during the 
period of observation. Continuous sound may include, without limitation, music, mechanical equipment, 
construction equipment, and motor vehicles. 
    Emergency means any occurrence or set of circumstances involving actual or imminent physical 
trauma or property damage which demands immediate action. 
    Impulse sound means a single or multiple sound event characterized by a rapid rise to a maximum 
sound pressure of high intensity, followed by a somewhat slower decrease in sound pressure. The 
duration of an impulse sound event, which included a combination of rise tie, peak amplitude and decay, 
shall be no more than one second. Impulse sound may include, without limitation, the discharge of a 
weapon, pile driver, or blasting. 
    Noise means any sound which annoys or disturbs humans or which causes or which tends to cause 
adverse psychological or physiological effect on humans. 
    Noise disturbance means any sound in quantities which are in excess of decibel standards specified 
herein and/or are or may be potentially harmful or injurious to human health or welfare, or which 
unnecessarily interferes with the enjoyment of life or property, including outdoor recreation, of a 
reasonable person with normal sensitivities. 
    Residential neighborhood means the various residential zoning districts specified in Chapter 150 of 
this Code of Ordinance, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, single family, 
duplex, multi-family, and townhouse districts. 
    Sound level means the weighted sound pressure level obtained by the use of a metering 
characteristic and weighting A, B, or C, as specified in American National Standards Institute 
specifications for sound level meters (ANSI S1.4-current edition). If the weighting employed is not 
indicated, the A-weighting shall apply. 
    Sound level meter means an instrument which includes a microphone, amplifier, RMS detector, 
integrator or time averager, output meter and weighting network or digital signal acquisition and analysis 
modules to perform these and other functions, used to measure sound pressure levels. The output meter 
reads sound pressure level when properly calibrated. The sound level meter shall be of Type 1 as 
specified in the American National Standards Institute publication entitled "Specifications for Sound Level 
Meters," designated as ANSI S1.4 2014 and should be capable of measuring the A-Weighted Equivalent 
Sound Pressure Level. The period of time over which sound levels are measured reflects the nature of 
the situation and the minimum measurement time shall be no less than two minutes. 
    Sound pressure means the instantaneous difference between the actual pressure and the average 
or barometric pressure at a given point in space, as produced by the presence of sound energy. 
    Sound pressure level means 20 times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the RMS sound 
pressure to the reference pressure of 20 micro-newtons per meter squared. The sound pressure level is

or any other ordinance or code section applicable to the City, listed in the schedule which appears in

members of the hearing officer board shall not be considered to be City employees. 
(a) ?The Hearing Officer Board shall consist of all the current and active members of the City 
Code Enforcement Board. Membership on the City Code Enforcement Board shall be a 
specific condition of membership on the Hearing Officer Board. It is the intention of the City 
that the membership and composition of the Code Enforcement Board and the Hearing 
Officer Board shall be identical. 
(b) ?The Hearing Officer Board shall conduct administrative hearings brought to appeal the 
determination of a code enforcement officer which resulted in the issuance of a civil 
infraction citation. In addition, the Hearing Officer Board shall have the power to: 
1. ?Adopt procedures for the conduct of hearings.

violation of any provision of the Code of Ordinances or any other ordinance or code sections 
applicable to the City listed in the schedule which appears in the appendix. 
(D) ?Procedure for issuance of civil infraction citation. 
(1) ?A code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a civil infraction citation to any person, 
persons or entities when, based upon personal investigation, the officer has reasonable cause 
to believe that the person, persons, or entities has committed a civil infraction in violation of any 
provision of the Code of Ordinances, or any other ordinances or codes applicable to the City, 
listed in the schedule incorporated herein by reference in division (I) of this section. 
(2) ?Prior to issuing a civil infraction citation, a code enforcement officer shall provide notice to the 
legally responsible person, persons or entities that a civil infraction violation exists and provide a 
reasonable time period within which the civil infraction violation must be corrected. The 
determination as to the amount of time provided for correction shall be based upon 
considerations of fairness, practicality, ease of correction, ability to correct, severity of violation, 
nature, extent and probability of danger or damage to the public, and other relevant factors 
relating to the reasonableness of the time period provided. 
(3) ?However, a code enforcement officer does not have to provide a violator with a reasonable 
time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation, and may immediately issue a 
citation, if a repeat violation is found, or if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe 
that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or if the 
violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(4) ?If, upon personal investigation, the code enforcement officer determines that the person, 
persons, or entities have not corrected the civil infraction violation within the allotted period of 
time, the code enforcement officer may then issue a civil infraction citation to the person, 
persons, or entities who committed the civil infraction violation. 
(5) ?Service of the civil infraction citation shall be effected by personally delivering it to the violator, 
or his/her/its agents, or by leaving the citation at the violator's usual place of abode with any 
person residing therein who is 15 years of age or older and informing that person of its contents, 
or by sending the citation by certified mail, return receipt requested. If service cannot be 
effected by any other means, posting of the civil infraction citation in a conspicuous place on the 
premises or property upon which the violation has been observed may be performed. Such 
posting shall be deemed proper service, and the time for compliance, stated in the citation, shall 
commence with the date such citation is posted. Proof of posting shall be verified by photograph 
and affidavit. Any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code 
enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as 
provided in F.S.A. §§ 775.082 or 775.083. 
(6) ?The civil infraction citation shall contain the following information: 
(a) ?The date and time of issuance. 
(b) ?The name and address of the person, persons or entities to whom the citation is issued. 
(c) ?The date and time the civil infraction was committed and the time in which the violation 
must be corrected. 
(d) ?The facts constituting reasonable cause. 
(e) ?The number or section of the code or ordinance provision violated. 
(f) ?The name and authority of the code enforcement officer. 
(g) ?The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil penalty or to contest the 
citation.

(i) ?The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
(j) ?A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time 
allowed, or fails to appear to contest the citation, such conduct shall be deemed a waiver of 
all rights to contest the citation, and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against 
the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(k) ?Notice that the violator may be liable for reasonable costs of the administrative hearing if 
found guilty the violation. 
(l) ?Notice that each day of continued violation after the time period for correction has lapsed 
shall be deemed a continuing violation, subject to an additional penalty in the same 
amount, without the need for additional notices of violation. 
(m) ?Notice that the filing of a request for an administrative hearing will not halt the accrual of 
continuing violation penalties. 
(7) ?After issuance of a civil infraction citation to a violator, the code enforcement officer shall 
deliver the original citation to the citation system administrative assistant, previously designated 
by the City Manager, and retain a copy of the civil infraction citation in the code enforcement 
department file. 
(E) ?Rights and procedures following issuance of civil infraction citations. 
(1) ?Any person, persons or entities served with civil infraction citations pursuant to the provisions 
hereof shall have the option to either: 
(a) ?Pay the prescribed civil penalty in the manner indicated on the civil infraction citation and 
correct the violation within the time specified in the citation; or, 
(b) ?Request an administrative hearing before the Hearing Officer Board to appeal the 
determination of the code enforcement officer which resulted in the issuance of the civil 
infraction. 
(2) ?All requests for administrative hearing shall be in writing and shall either be hand delivered or 
mailed to the City code enforcement department within 15 days after service of the civil 
infraction citation. All mailed requests must be postmarked within the 15 day appeal period to be 
considered timely filed. 
(3) ?If the person, persons or entities named in the civil infraction citation fail to pay the civil penalty 
and correct the violation (within the time specified), or to timely request an administrative 
hearing before the Hearing Officer Board, such failure shall constitute a waiver of the violator's 
right to an administrative hearing before the Hearing Officer Board. A waiver of the right to an 
administrative hearing shall be treated as an admission of the violation and penalties may be 
assessed accordingly. 
(F) ?Administrative appellate hearing process. 
(1) ?Upon receipt of a named violator's timely request for an administrative appellate hearing to 
contest a civil infraction citation, the previously designated administrative assistant to the 
supplemental code enforcement citation system shall schedule the appellate request for hearing 
before the Hearing Officer Board on the next available hearing calendar, or as soon thereafter 
as is practicable. 
(2) ?Upon the scheduling of an appropriate hearing date, the administrative assistant shall promptly 
notify the named violator of the date and time of the administrative appellate hearing. In 
addition, the notice of hearing provided to the named violator shall include the following: 
(a) ?Name of the code enforcement officer who issued the citation. 
(b) ?Factual description of the violation. 
(c) ?Date of the violation. 
(d) ?The number or section of the code or ordinance provision violated. 
(e) ?Place, date and time of the hearing. 
(f) ?Right of the named violator to be represented by an attorney. 
(g) ?Right of the named violator to present witnesses and evidence and cross-examine City 
witnesses. 
(h) ?Notice that the named violator's failure to attend the scheduled hearing may result in a 
civil penalty being assessed. 
(i) ?Notice that requests for continuances will not be considered if not received in writing by the 
code enforcement department at least ten calendar days prior to the date set for the 
hearing. 
(3) ?Administrative appellate hearings shall be scheduled and conducted on a regular monthly 
basis. However, additional special hearings may be scheduled upon the request of the City 
Manager. 
(4) ?All hearings before the Hearing Officer Board shall be open to the public. All hearing testimony 
shall be taken under oath. Assuming proper hearing notice, a hearing may proceed in the 
absence of any named violator. 
(5) ?The proceedings at the hearing shall be recorded electronically. However, any party may 
provide for the attendance of a court reporter or stenographer at their expense. The 
transcription of the court reporter's or stenographer's record shall be the responsibility of the 
party ordering such transcription. 
(6) ?The City Manager shall provide an administrative assistant and all other support personnel 
required for the conduct of all administrative appellate hearings and all other related procedures 
and processes. 
(7) ?Each case before the Hearing Officer Board shall be presented by the code enforcement officer 
issuing the civil infraction citation at issue. 
(8) ?The administrative hearings shall not be conducted in accordance with the formal rules of 
evidence and the admission of testimony. Any relevant evidence or testimony shall be admitted 
if the Hearing Officer Board finds it competent and reliable, regardless of the existence of any 
common law or statutory rule to the contrary. 
(9) ?Each party shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, to introduce evidence and 
exhibits, to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues (even 
though that matter was not covered in the direct examination), to impeach any witness 
(regardless of which party first solicited testimony) and to rebut any adverse evidence. 
(10) ?The Hearing Officer Board shall enter an order upon the conclusion of each hearing which 
shall contain findings of fact based on the evidence and testimony in the record. In order to 
make a finding which upholds a code enforcement officer's determination that a violation 
existed, the Hearing Officer Board must find that the preponderance of the evidence indicates 
that the named violator was legally responsible for the violation of the specified section of the 
code or ordinance listed on the citation, and that a violation did, in fact, exist at the time the 
citation was issued. 
(11) ?The time prescribed for correction of the violation given to the named violator and contained in 
the civil infraction citation shall be presumed to have beef a reasonable time for correction. 
Upon presentation of relevant evidence by the named violator that the time for correction was 
not reasonable, the Hearing Officer Board may make a re-determination as to the 
reasonableness of the time for correction specified by the code enforcement officer. If the 
Hearing Officer Board determines that the time given for correction was insufficient, the penalty 
for a continuing violation may be calculated from the date determined by the Hearing Officer 
Board to be the reasonable date for correction. 
(12) ?If the named violator is found guilty of the violation, the violator may be held liable for the 
reasonable costs of the administrative hearing. 
(13) ?The fact-finding determination of the Hearing Officer Board shall be limited to whether the 
alleged violation did, in fact, occur and, if so, whether the person named in the civil infraction 
citation is legally responsible for the violation. The Hearing Officer Board shall either affirm or 
reverse the determination of the code enforcement officer as to the responsibility of the named 
violator for the correction of the violation. The Hearing Officer Board may also modify the 
determination of the code enforcement officer as to the time for correction contained in the civil 
infraction citation as previously set forth herein. If the Hearing Officer Board reverses the 
determination of the code enforcement officer and finds the named violator not responsible for 
the violation set forth in the civil infraction citation, the named violator shall not be liable for the 
payment of any civil penalty, absent a successful appeal of the Hearing Officer Board's ruling by 
the City. If the decision of the Hearing Officer Board is to affirm the code enforcement officer's 
determination of violation, then the following elements may be included: 
(a) ?Amount of civil penalty. 
(b) ?Reasonable costs of administrative appellate hearing. 
(c) ?Date by which the violation must be corrected to prevent resumption of continuing violation 
penalties. 
(14) ?The Hearing Officer Board shall not conduct a hearing if the named violator, prior to the 
scheduled hearing date, files with a duly authorized City or county board of appropriate 
jurisdiction, a request for an administrative interpretation of the legal provision(s) upon which the 
alleged violation is based. Upon exhaustion of the administrative review, and the issuance of an 
administrative order by such board, the Hearing Officer Board may exercise all powers granted 
by this chapter. The Hearing Officer Board shall not, however, exercise any jurisdiction over the 
alleged violation where a named violator has properly filed a request for an administrative 
interpretation and review by an appropriate City or county board until the time permitted for 
review has lapsed. 
(15) ?The Hearing Officer Board shall be bound by the interpretations and decisions of the duly 
authorized City or county board concerning the provisions within their respective jurisdictions. In 
the event such a board finds that the cited violation has not been properly interpreted by the 
City, the board's ruling shall prohibit the Hearing Officer Board from proceeding with the 
enforcement of the alleged violation. 
(G) ?Appeal process from the Hearing Officer Board's determination. 
(1) ?Either the named violator or the City may appeal any determination made by the Hearing 
Officer Board by filing a notice of appeal with the Dade County Circuit Court. The notice shall be 
filed within 30 days of the issuance of the Order containing the determination made by the 
Hearing Officer Board which is to be appealed. 
(2) ?In the absence of a reversal of the Hearing Officer Board's ruling by an appellate court of 
competent jurisdiction, the findings of the Hearing Officer Board shall be conclusive, and such 
findings shall be admissible in any further proceedings to collect unpaid penalties. 
(H) ?Methods of collection of civil penalties. 
(1) ?The City may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel the payment 
of all civil penalties imposed or assessed. 
(2) ?A certified copy of an order imposing a civil penalty may be recorded in the public records of 
Dade County and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists 
or existed. If the named violator does not own the subject land, the Order shall constitute a lien 
upon any other real or personal property owned by the named violator. Any lien created by this 
chapter may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, 
including levy against personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgment, 
except for enforcement purposes. After three months from the filing of any such lien which 
remains unpaid, the City may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien created by this chapter. 
(I) ?Schedule of civil infractions and civil penalties. 
(1) ?The schedule appearing in the appendix, titled "Civil Infraction Code Sections and Civil 
Penalties for Violation", constitutes a listing of all City Code of Ordinance sections and all other 
chapter or code sections that are applicable to the City, as they may be amended from time to 
time, which may be enforced pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The subject schedule 
also prescribes the civil penalty amounts that can be assessed for violation of the listed 
ordinance and code provisions. In the future, the City Council may, by the enactment of 
appropriate City resolutions, add, delete, amend, clarify, or supplement the civil infraction 
sections and civil penalties contained in the schedule. 
(2) ?The "descriptions of violations" set forth in the schedule are for informational purposes only. In 
order to determine the exact nature of a prescribed or required activity, action, or process, the 
actual text of the specific ordinance or code section should be consulted and reviewed. 
(3) ?The amount of any civil penalty imposed may be affected by the nature, duration, and extent of 
the civil infractions contained in any citation. The schedule of civil penalties is intended only as a 
limitation on the amount to be imposed for a single civil infraction which occurred on a single 
occasion.

Chapter 102 - RE-OCCUPANCY CERTIFICATION 


Sec. 102-01. - Re-occupancy certification. 
(A) ?Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to require that all single-family residential properties in the City 
be inspected and certified for appropriate occupancy and usage prior to any transfer of ownership 
following the enactment hereof. 
(B) ?Applicability. The provisions contained in this chapter shall be applicable to all single-family 
residentially zoned properties upon which homes have been constructed thereon in the City. 
(C) ?Compliance or certification. All single-family residentially zoned homes in the City shall comply with 
the following provisions: 
(1) ?It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to buy, sell, convey, or transfer, any 
single-family home without first obtaining a Re-occupancy Certificate from the Department of 
Building, Zoning and Code Enforcement. The Re-occupancy Certificate, if issued, shall state 
that the City has inspected the subject premises and has determined that the subject premises 
is in compliance with the single-family residential occupancy regulations of the City Code of 
Ordinances and that the dwelling is designed, configured, and being used for single-family 
residential purposes only. No certificate may be issued if the subject premises is not in 
compliance with the single-family residential occupancy regulations of the City Code of 
Ordinances, or if it is found to be designed, configured or being used for other than single-family 
residential purposes. The form of the Certificate shall be prepared by the City and may be 
amended from time to time as determined to be required by the City. 
(2) ?It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to close on the transfer or conveyance of 
any single-family home owned by such person, firm or corporation, without the owner having 
first disclosed, by written notice to the buyer, grantee or transferee, the fact that a Re-
occupancy Certificate is required by the City in order to properly convey or transfer title to the 
subject premises. The form of the disclosure notice shall be prepared by the City and may be 
amended from time to time as determined to be required by the City. 
(3) ?It shall be the responsibility of the property owner/seller to apply for Re-occupancy Certificate 
inspection with the Department of Building, Zoning and Code Enforcement. The City shall 
provide an appropriate application form for this purpose and shall establish the fee for the initial 
inspection by City Resolution. The form of application and the amount of the fee charged for the 
initial inspection may be amended from time to time as determined to be required by the City. 
As part of the application process, the owner/seller shall provide an accurate survey or sketch of 
the sale premises which sets forth thereon the location, size, and generic identification of each 
tree located on the property being sold. 
(4) ?Upon receipt of an application for inspection and the payment of the initial inspection fee, an 
authorized representative of the Department of Building, Zoning and Code Enforcement shall 
inspect the subject property within ten days thereof. The appropriate Re-occupancy Certificate 
shall be issued should the subject premises be determined to be in compliance with the single-
family residential occupancy regulation of the City Code of Ordinances and that it is designed, 
configured and being used for single-family residential purposes only. If, however, the subject 
property is not in full compliance with the foregoing requirements, the Department shall prepare 
an itemized list of all code and district regulation violations and notify the owner/seller in writing 
of all corrective action required to obtain the necessary certificate. The aforesaid notice shall 
also provide that the determination of property noncompliance by the Department may be 
appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Manager within five days of receipt of 
said notice of noncompliance. Upon receipt of a written notice of appeal, the City Manager shall 
conduct an appeal hearing at the earliest possible time. The written appellate decision of the 
City Manager shall constitute final City action in regard to the determination of the issuance of a 
Re-occupancy Certificate. No certificate shall be issued by the Department for any premises 
until all specified violations have been corrected to the satisfaction of the City. 
(5) ?As an alternative to appealing the determination of property noncompliance made by the 
Department when a proposed sale transaction of a subject property is pending, the property 
owner/seller may request the issuance of a Re-occupancy Certificate on a "conditional" basis. In 
order to initiate the "conditional" issuance process, the property owner/seller shall be required to 
pay the fee that has been previously established by City Resolution for the preparation of the 
"Certificate of Re-occupancy Completion of Work Escrow Agreement" and the efforts to be 
expended by staff in the administration of the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement 
(the fee established by the City Resolution shall be included in the "Schedule of Fees" for the 
Building Department). Although the City is aware of the usual expedited nature of the subject 
sales transactions, the time of completion for the City evaluation and preparation of the 
proposed agreement will be on a case-by-case basis. All agreements prepared by the City 
pursuant to this provision shall not be complete until they include the following: 
(a) ?City notice of determination of property noncompliance. 
(b) ?Fully executed contract or contracts for the property rehabilitation work required by the 
City. 
(c) ?City Finance Department receipt evidencing the deposit with the City of double the amount 
required for the completion of the property rehabilitation work required by the City. 
(d) ?Execution by the property owner/seller, property buyer, and the City Manager. 
Upon compliance with the foregoing requirements, the Department may then issue the 
requested Re-occupancy Certificate for the subject property and begin the administration of the 
"Certificate of Re-occupancy Completion of Work Escrow Agreement" in accordance with the 
terms and conditions contained therein. 
(6) ?It shall be the responsibility of the owner/seller to apply for the reinspection of any premises 
that has previously been denied the issuance of a Re-occupancy Certificate. Upon receipt of an 
application for reinspection and the payment of the reinspection fee, an authorized 
representative of the Department of Building, Zoning and Code Enforcement shall inspect the 
subject property within ten days thereof. The City shall provide an appropriate application form 
for this purpose and shall establish the fee for each reinspection performed on a premises by 
City Resolution. The form of application and the amount of the fee charged for each 
reinspection may be amended from time to time as determined to be required by the City. 
(7) ?Re-occupancy Certificates issued following initial inspections or reinspections shall remain 
effective for 45 days from issuance. The effective period for such certificates may be extended 
one time for an additional 45 days upon the payment of an extension fee to be established by 
City Resolution. If the subject premises is not transferred or conveyed, and the re-occupancy 
certification recorded, within the effective period of any Re-occupancy Certificate, the 
owner/seller shall be required to reapply for a new Re-occupancy Certificate. The amount of the 
fee charged for the extension of the effective period of any Re-occupancy Certificate may be 
amended from time to time as determined to be required by the City. 
(8) ?Upon the closing of any transfer or conveyance of title of any single-family residential premises 
issued a certificate pursuant to the provisions hereof, the City's original Re-occupancy 
Certificate shall be recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County, Florida, along with the 
deed or other title conveyance document for the subject premises. 
(D) ?Failure to comply. Any single-family residentially zoned property that is bought, sold, conveyed or 
transferred without first securing the Re-occupancy Certificate required by this chapter, shall 
thereafter be considered by the City to be a nonconforming property which shall subject the property 
to all restrictions, limitations, and penalties provided by the City Code of Ordinances. 
(E) ?Information secured. Information gained or conditions observed in the course of any inspection 
conducted pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance shall not be utilized by the Code Enforcement 
Department as the basis for the issuance of new citations or notices of violation other than those 
violations of the residential occupancy and usage regulations of the City Code applicable to the 
subject premises. However, this provision shall not preclude the initiation or institution of other 
enforcement actions brought upon the basis of information gained or violations observed by other 
lawful means. 
(F) ?Representation and warranty. A Re-occupancy Certificate shall not constitute any representation or 
warranty as to the condition, or any aspect of such condition, of the subject premises, for which the 
Certificate was issued. The City review and investigation made in connection with the issuance of 
any Re-occupancy Certificate is neither a structural, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or any other 
substantive inspection of the structure on any property and does not represent that the premises 
conforms to the requirements of the Code of Ordinances, including, but not limited to, the building 
and technical code provisions adopted by the City. 
(G) ?Notice. All City responses to requests for lien or estoppel information regarding any single-family 
residential property in the City shall contain a notice provision therein that Re-occupancy Certificates 
are required for all real estate transactions involving the transfer or conveyance of title to all single-
family residential properties in the City. 
(H) ?Education and transition. In order to provide a reasonable period of education and transition in 
regard to the provisions contained herein, Re-occupancy Certificates shall be required for all 
applicable real estate closings and other applicable transactions that occur subsequent to 
September 1, 2002.

conformity with all existing plans of record and that it has not been reconfigured for multi-family 
usage along with a sworn affidavit from the owner attesting to the fact that the subject property

Sec. 103-02. - Regulations against squatting. 
    The following regulations and procedures are hereby enacted in order to prevent the practice of 
"squatting" in the City. 
(A) ?Definitions. 
(1) ?Squatting is defined as the occupation of private property without authorization from the 
owner or lessee. 
(2) ?Squatters are defined as occupants of private property without authorization from the 
owner or lessee. 
(3) ?Lessee is defined to include the lessee, any sublessee, or any other legal occupant of the 
premises. 
(B) ?Squatting prohibited. Squatting is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance, and is 
prohibited in the City of Miami Springs. 
(C) ?Action to remove squatters. A property owner or lessee is required to take all lawful measures 
to prevent or remove squatters. 
(D) ?Penalties. Any violation of the provisions of this section shall result in a fine of $500.00 for 
each day the violation remains uncured. 
(E) ?Removal of squatters and lien for costs of removal. The City is authorized to remove squatters 
from private property and to secure the property. The property owner or lessee shall reimburse 
the City for the expenses incurred in removing the squatters and securing the property. If the 
property owner or lessee does not reimburse the City for the cost of removing the squatters and 
securing the property within 30 days of the date the City sends an invoice, then the City may 
lien the property for such costs an administrative fee of $500.00 to cover administrative 
personnel service costs. The City's lien shall constitute a special assessment lien which may be 
recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County. The lien shall accrue interest at the 
maximum legal rate from the date of the City's invoice until all costs and the administrative fee 
are paid. The City may foreclose on such lien which shall have equal dignity with a real property 
tax lien. 
(F) ?Notice and hearing. The City shall post a notice at the property indicating its intent to remove 
squatters and secure the property at least five days in advance of any such action. The City 
shall also make reasonable efforts to separately notify the property owner or lessee. The City 
may provide shorter notice, or act immediately, without prior notice, where warranted by an 
emergency, such as a danger to the occupants (i.e. unfit dwelling) or threat to public safety. Any 
appeal of the notice must be received by the City within three days of posting. The failure to 
appeal constitutes an admission that the occupants are squatters and an agreement to the 
remedy of removal. If an appeal is timely received, the City shall set an administrative hearing 
before the City Manager, and the matter shall be heard on an expedited basis prior to the 
removal of the occupants, unless such prior removal is warranted by an emergency, such as a 
danger to the occupants (i.e. unfit dwelling) or threat to public safety, in which case the hearing 
shall be held on an expedited basis following the removal. 
(G) ?Presumption. Squatting may be presumed where the occupant of the property is unable to 
produce a written document, such as a lease, license, or other written proof of authorization 
from the property owner or lessee, demonstrating that the occupant has permission to be on the 
property. Squatting may also be presumed where a property is listed as vacant on the 
abandoned property registry, and yet is occupied. Such presumptions may be rebutted if the 
occupant provides competent, substantial evidence demonstrating authorization to be in the 
premises. The presumptions stated herein are not the exclusive method for determining 
whether squatting is occurring on a specific property. 
(H) ?Cumulative remedies. The remedies provided by this ordinance are cumulative with all other 
remedies, including the remedies for trespass, and are not exclusive. The City may remove 
trespassers pursuant to state law, including cases where a lawful trespass warning has been 
provided, and the occupants refuse to vacate the property. 
(I) ?Immunization. Law enforcement and code enforcement officers, as well as City staff and 
agents, are immunized from civil or criminal liability for actions taken to remove squatters and 
secure property pursuant to the authority of this ordinance.

franchise entity's police power and such reasonable regulations as the franchise authority may 
subsequently promulgate thereunder subject to the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Dade County. Nothing

levy nondiscriminatory occupational license taxes on any activity conducted by the grantee. 
(C) ?All privileges prescribed by such a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior lawful occupancy of 
the public streets and any other franchise rights granted by the City, and the franchise authority

with the City Manager at least six but not more than 18 months prior to the expiration of the franchise 
and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of $2,000.00 to be expended by the

operation. If such fair market value cannot be agreed on by the parties, it shall be determined by a

form to be approved by the agency. This list shall be available to the agency on request.

attachment agreement.

option, may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall pay to the franchise entity the cost 
thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized report.

Sec. 118-03. - Declaration of need and necessity. 
    The City Council, having determined that some businesses unreasonably use police services as a 
result of their lack of security, lack of management, or are of a nature that they require police service in 
excess of the average police service requirement of businesses generally within the City, resulting in the 
City being required to maintain police services specially benefiting the property occupied by these 
businesses, declares that the cost of excess police service should be borne by the excess business user 
and the business property benefitted thereby. It is the intent of the City Council to encourage business 
management practices tending to increase security for persons and property on the business property 
such as utilization of guards, electronic security systems, lighting, reduction of drunkenness, use of 
advice and counsel from the City police experts as to improvement of security requirements, and other 
similar activities.

business entities within the City during a fiscal year. The average number of police services may be 
increased or decreased by the City Council by resolution after public hearing. In determining the average 
number of police services available to businesses generally, the City Council shall take into consideration 
the number of contiguous business parcels or lots occupied by a single business entity, and the number 
of occupational licenses issued to businesses located thereon. The resolution shall set forth a contingent 
call factor and other criteria necessary from time to time to insure an equitable determination of the 
average number of police services available to any single business entity.

during any fiscal year. A police service user charge shall be chargeable for each police service after the 
extension of the average number of police services generally available to licensed businesses during the 
fiscal year. 
(Ord. 658-82, passed 4-26-82)

excess police services by businesses. The excess police service user charge shall approximate the 
budgeted cost of police services for the fiscal year applicable for all businesses generally. 
(Ord. 658-82, passed 4-26-82) 


Sec. 118-07. - Responsibility of owners and occupational licensees.

the City Council finds as follows: 
(1) ?Establishments exist or may exist within the City where books, magazines, motion pictures, 
videos, prints, photographs, periodicals, records, novelties, and devices that depict, illustrate, 
describe, or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed, 
and sold. 
(2) ?Establishments exist or may exist within the City where: 
(a) ?The superficial tissues of one person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded, or 
tapped by a second person, accompanied by the display or exposure of specified 
anatomical areas; 
(b) ?Dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for forms of commercial gain, 
perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or 
(c) ?Lap dancing occurs. 
(3) ?The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur at establishments for the purpose of 
making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the City in the interest of the health, 
safety, and general welfare of City residents. 
(4) ?The competitive commercial exploitation of such nudity and seminudity is adverse to the 
public's interest, quality of life, tone of commerce, and total community environment. 
(5) ?The commercial exploitation of nudity and seminudity consists of the use of nude and 
seminude entertainment in connection with or for the promotion of the sale of goods or services, 
and the receipt of money by the person engaging in nude or seminude entertainment in 
exchange for or as consideration for nude or seminude performance by such individuals. 
(6) ?The commercial exploitation of nude and seminude acts, exhibitions, and nude entertainment 
occurs frequently at commercial establishments either selling or allowing consumption of 
alcoholic beverages on the premises. 
(7) ?There is a direct relationship between the consumption of alcoholic beverages and the nude 
and seminude activities mentioned above, and an increase in criminal activities, disturbances of 
the peace and good order of the community. The occurrence of these activities is hazardous to 
the health and the safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of 
adjoining property and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. 
(8) ?The combination of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the performance of 
nude and seminude acts, exhibitions and entertainment is adverse to the public's interest and 
the quality of life, tone of commerce, and total community environment in the City. 
(9) ?To promote and preserve the public peace and good order and to safeguard the health, safety, 
and welfare of the community and its citizens, it is necessary and advisable for the City to 
prohibit certain forms of nude and seminude acts, exhibitions, entertainment, and commercial 
establishments at which alcoholic beverages are, or are available to be, sold or consumed. 
(10) ?To preserve the public peace and good order, and to safeguard the health, safety, and 
welfare of the community and its residents, it is necessary and advisable to regulate and restrict 
the conduct of owners, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, patrons, 
spectators, and persons on the premises of the commercial establishment subject to this 
Chapter. 
(11) ?There is a direct relationship between the display or depiction of specified anatomical areas 
as defined in this Chapter and an increase in criminal activities and disturbances of the peace 
and good order of the community, and the occurrence of these activities is hazardous to the 
health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining 
property and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. These secondary effects 
are adverse to the public's interest and quality of life, tone of commerce, and total community 
environment in the City. 
(12) ?When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) take place in establishments within 
the City, other activities that are illegal or unhealthy tend to accompany them, concentrate 
around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, 
prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, possession, distribution 
and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and 
violent crimes against persons and property. 
(13) ?When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) are present in establishments within 
the City, they tend to blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower 
property values, foster an atmosphere that promotes crime, and ultimately lead residents and 
businesses to move to other locations. 
(14) ?Physical contact between employees exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers 
within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur poses a 
threat to the health of both and may lead to the spread of communicable, infectious, and social 
diseases. 
(15) ?To preserve and safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the City, it 
is necessary and advisable for the City to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, 
agents, employees, entertainers, performers, and customers at establishments where the 
activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur. 
(16) ?The potential dangers to the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the City 
from the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occurring at establishments without first 
obtaining a license under this Chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such 
establishments before they are permitted to operate. 
(17) ?"Lap dancing" does not contain an element of communication, and is therefore conduct rather 
than expression. 
(18) ?"Lap dancing" in establishments poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes 
the spread of communicable, infectious, and social diseases. 
(19) ?Adult-related businesses are frequently used for unlawful and unhealthy sexual activities, 
including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature. 
(20) ?The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the City that 
demands reasonable regulation of adult-related businesses in order to protect the health and 
well-being of the citizens. 
(21) ?The prevention of sexual contact between patrons and employees at adult dancing 
establishments is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, but serves to address the 
concerns raised in the findings contained in this Chapter. Although the dancer's erotic message 
may be slightly less effective from four feet away, the ability to engage in the protected 
expression is not significantly impaired. 
(22) ?Separating dancers from patrons, and prohibiting dancers and patrons from engaging in 
sexual fondling and caressing in adult dancing establishments, would reduce the opportunity for 
prostitution transactions and thus should help to deter prostitution. 
(23) ?To preserve and safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the City, it 
is necessary and advisable for the City to obtain sufficient information regarding the owners of 
establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) occur in order to 
preclude the involvement of organized crime. 
(24) ?Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting in adult theaters advances 
the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity 
occurring at adult theaters. 
(25) ?Requiring that the facilities of adult theaters be constructed of materials that are easy to clean, 
that the facilities be cleaned on a regular basis, and that the employees cleaning the facilities 
take reasonable precautions to avoid contact with possible disease-transmitting media is 
reasonably related to the protection of both employees and patrons from sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
(26) ?Licensing is a legitimate, reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of 
adult-related businesses comply with the reasonable regulations within this Chapter and the 
location requirements of the zoning code, and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow 
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation. 
(Ord. 1051-2013, passed 2-25-13) 


Sec. 119-04. - Rules of construction. 
    This Chapter shall be construed liberally to accomplish its purpose of licensing and regulating adult-
related businesses. 
(Ord. 1051-2013, passed 2-25-13) 


Sec. 119-05. - Purpose. 
    In the development and enforcement of Chapter 119 "Adult-Related Businesses Code," the City 
recognizes that adult-related businesses, because of their very nature, have serious objectionable 
characteristics, and have a deleterious effect upon the adjacent business and residential areas. It is 
desirable, therefore, to protect the well-being of the youth of the City from objectionable operational 
characteristics of these adult-related businesses by to locating them away from residential areas and 
public facilities used frequently by minors such as schools, religious facilities, parks, instructional schools 
serving minors, and day care centers. The City finds that, just as advertising is designed to stimulate 
one's appetite for desired goods and services, an overabundance or preoccupation with sexual displays 
or materials arouses the appetites of those so preoccupied, and encourages criminal sexual behavior. 
    In recognition of the protections afforded to the citizens of the United States under the First and 
Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, it is neither the intent nor the effect of 
this Chapter to: 
(a) ?Inhibit freedom of speech or the press; or 
(b) ?Limit or restrict the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented 
materials; or 
(c) ?Restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First 
Amendment; or 
(d) ?Deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their 
intended market. 
    This Chapter balances the legitimate governmental purposes of the City against the above-described 
constitutional rights, by imposing incidental, content-neutral place, time, and manner regulations of adult-
related businesses without limiting alternative avenues of communication. The regulations deemed 
necessary to control the undesirable effects arising from these enterprises are set forth in this Chapter. 
(Ord. 1051-2013, passed 2-25-13)

Sec. 130-06. - Sexual offenders and sexual predators. 
(A) ?Findings and intent. 
1. ?Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who 
prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. 
Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and 
most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, 
and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender 
victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
2. ?It is the intent of this section to serve the City's compelling interest to promote, protect and 
improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City by creating areas around 
locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual 
offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent 
residence. 
(B) ?Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section shall have the 
meanings ascribed to them herein, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
1. ?Permanent residence means a place where the person abides, lodges or resides for 14 or more 
consecutive days. 
2. ?Temporary residence means a place where the person abides, lodges or resides for a period of 
14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's 
permanent address, or a place where the person routinely abides, lodges or resides for a period 
of four or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the person's 
permanent residence. 
(C) ?Sexual offender and sexual predator residence prohibition; penalties; exceptions. 
1. ?It is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a violation of §§ 794.011, 800.04, 
827.071 or 847.0145, Florida Statutes, regardless of whether adjudication has been withheld, in 
which the victim of the offense was less than 16 years of age, to establish a permanent 
residence or temporary residence within 2,500 feet of any school, designated public school bus 
stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate. 
2. ?For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be 
measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent residence or 
temporary residence to nearest outer property line of a school, designated public school bus 
stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate. 
3. ?Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 
or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment; 
for a second or subsequent conviction of a violation of this Section, such person shall be 
punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisonment for not more than 12 months, or by 
both such fine and imprisonment. 
4. ?Exceptions. A person residing within 2,500 feet of any school, designated public school bus 
stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate 
does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply: 
(a) ?The person established the permanent residence prior to July 1, 2005. 
(b) ?The person was a minor when he/she committed the offense and was not convicted as an 
adult. 
(c) ?The person is a minor. 
(d) ?The school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, or other 
place where children regularly congregate, located within 2,500 feet of the person's 
permanent residence, was opened after the person established the permanent residence. 
(D) ?Property owners prohibited from renting real property to certain sexual offenders and sexual 
predators; penalties. 
1. ?It is unlawful to let or rent any place, structure, or part thereof, with the knowledge that it will be 
used as a permanent residence or temporary residence by any person prohibited from 
establishing such permanent residence or temporary residence pursuant to subsection (C) of 
this section, if such place, structure, or part thereof, is located within 2,500 feet of any school, 
designated public school bus stop, day care center, park playground, or other place where 
children regularly congregate. 
2. ?A property owner's failure to comply with provisions of this subsection will constitute a violation 
of this section and shall subject the property owner to the code enforcement provisions and 
procedures as provided in §§ 32-65 through 32-71 and § 101-01 of this Code, including all

parking spaces, access aisles, driveways, landscaping, and relationship to the uses or structure 
that the off-street parking facilities or parking lots are intended to serve.

street parking facilities that maintain a parking attendant on the premises who is available to 
move parked vehicles.

(B) ?Determining consistency with the comprehensive plan. If a development proposal is found to meet 
all of the requirements of this Code it shall be presumed to be consistent with the comprehensive 
plan in all respects except for compliance with the concurrency requirement of the comprehensive 
plan capital improvements element policy 4.1 and division (A) above. The City Manager, his 
designee, or any substantially affected person as defined in F.S. § 163.3213 may question the 
consistency of a development proposal with the comprehensive plan. If a question of consistency is 
raised, the person or board responsible for issuing the development order or permit shall make a 
determination of consistency or inconsistency in writing fully recited within the instrument or 
instruments documenting the development order or development permit. 
(C) ?Maintaining level of service standards. 
(1) ?Levels of service must be maintained. No development order or permit may be issued unless 
the proposed development meets the following requirements designed to insure that roads, 
sanitary sewers, solid waste disposal, drainage, potable water, and public recreation facilities 
and services are available at prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impacts of the 
development. 
(2) ?Determination of available capacity. For purposes of these regulations the available capacity of 
a capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
(a) ?Adding together: 
1. ?The total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
2. ?The total capacity of new facilities that will come available concurrent with the impact 
of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more 
of the following is shown: 
a. ?Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of application; 
b. ?The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the 
construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time the 
development permit is issued; 
c. ?The new facilities have been included in the capital improvement program annual 
budget of the facility and service provider entities; 
d. ?The new facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement. An 
enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, 
development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or 
development order pursuant to F.S. chapter 380. Such facilities must be 
consistent with the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan and 
approved by the City Manager or his designee; or 
e. ?The developer has contributed funds to the facility and service provider entities 
necessary to provide new facilities consistent with the capital improvements 
element of the comprehensive plan or the officially adopted plans and programs 
of the relevant facility and service provider entities. Commitment that the facilities 
will be built must be evidenced by an appropriate budget amendment and 
appropriation by the City or other facility and service provider entity. 
(b) ?Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
1. ?The demand for the service created by existing development; and 
2. ?The new demand for the service that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the 
proposed development by the anticipated completion of other presently approved 
developments. 
(D) ?Concurrency review responsibilities. The City Manager may designate a City department or 
member of professional staff as the agency or official responsible for the conduct of concurrency 
reviews pursuant to this section. Said department or official may utilize the resources of the county 
concurrency information center established by County Code Sec. 33G-7 as deemed necessary, and 
any costs so incurred shall be borne by the applicant. Said department or official may require that 
any other appropriate City department or official furnish information with respect to existing and 
future capacities, levels of demand, and levels of service of any public facilities or service delivery 
systems, regardless of whether the facility or system in question is under the direct operation or 
control of the department or official to which the request for information is directed, it being the intent 
of this division that the City departments and officials most knowledgeable about particular facilities 
and systems make concurrency determinations with respect to such facilities and systems. 
(E) ?Surplus capacity areas. The City Manager or his designee, in consultation with the county 
concurrency information center established in County Code Sec. 33G-7 and other applicable 
agencies and officials, may designate geographic areas of the City where certain services or facilities 
have sufficient surplus capacity to sustain protected development of specified types for one to five or 
more years, as applicable to the service. In areas so designated as having surplus capacity, 
development orders for the specified types of development may be issued without requiring 
concurrency reviews for the specified services. All such surplus capacity designations shall be 
reviewed no less frequently than annually. 
(F) ?Concurrency determination responsibilities of applicant and City. 
(1) ?Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this section the burden of showing compliance 
with the requirements of this section shall be upon the developer. In order to be approvable, 
applications for development approval shall provide sufficient information showing compliance 
with these standards. In this regard, all applications for development orders or permits subject 
to the consistency and concurrency determination provisions of this section shall specify, in 
graphic, cartographic, narrative, or tabular form, as appropriate, in addition to other 
requirements, the specific uses to which the land or structures will be put, the numbers of 
single-family and multifamily residential dwelling units, and the number of square feet of floor 
area and land area devoted to each nonresidential use. Applications shall also specify phasing 
of buildout, if applicable, and any service impact mitigation measures proposed by the applicant 
or to which the applicant agrees. 
(2) ?The City Manager or his designee may require that the information and representations 
required by this division be submitted in the form of a site plan or other appropriate format, and 
set forth in a recordable written instrument running with the land. 
(3) ?The City Manager or his designee may require that the applicant secure certain information 
and analysis from the county concurrency information center at his cost, to meet the 
requirements of this section and division. In those instances where any portion or aspect of the 
applicant's development is, or will be subject to the county concurrency review pursuant to 
County Code Sec. 33G, the City Manager or his designee may require that the applicant 
request from the county that such concurrency review by the county occur at any point in the 
City review process. 
(G) ?Development impact and level of service standards. 
(1) ?Roadways. 
(a) ?Level of service. Applications for development orders and development permits shall not 
be approved unless there is a demonstration that sufficient available peak hour roadway 
capacity will exist to sustain the following levels of service (LOS) concurrent with the 
impacts of such development. 
1. ?City roads. As provided in the City comprehensive plan; traffic circulation element; 
goals, objectives, and policies. 
2. ?County roads. As provided in the Metro-Dade County Comprehensive Development 
Master Plan; Traffic Circulation Element; Traffic Circulation Goal, Objectives and 
Policies. 
3. ?State roads. As provided in the Metro-Dade County Comprehensive Development 
Master Plan; Traffic Circulation Element; Traffic Circulation Goal, Objectives and 
Policies, or the current Florida Department of Transportation Operating Level of 
Service Standards for the State Highway System, whichever is considered 
appropriate in each case by the City Manager or his designee. 
(b) ?Determination of project impact. The impact of proposed development activity on available 
capacity shall be determined as follows: 
1. ?The area of impact of the development (a traffic shed) shall be determined. The traffic 
shed shall be that area where the primary impact of traffic to and from the site occurs, 
without regard to jurisdictional boundaries and without regard to jurisdiction and 
responsibility over the impacted roadways in question. If sectors of the county have 
been designated for determining development impacts and planning capital 
improvements, such sectors or planning areas may be used. If the application is for a 
building permit for a single-family or duplex development, the impact shall be 
presumed to be limited to the collector or arterial serving the local street giving access 
to the lot, or to the collector or arterial giving direct access to the lot. 
2. ?The projected level of service for arterials and collectors within the traffic shed shall be 
calculated based upon estimated trips to be generated by the project, or where 
applicable, the first phase of the project, and taking into consideration the impact of 
other approved but not completed developments within the traffic shed. Information on 
committed development within the traffic shed shall be as provided by the county 
concurrency information center established by County Code Sec. 33G-7. Trip 
generation, distribution, and assignment methodologies used in estimating project 
trips shall be as provided by the county concurrency information center or other 
appropriate methodologies which shall meet professionally accepted standards 
pursuant to Rule 9J-5.005 of the Florida Administrative Code. 
(2) ?Sanitary sewers. Applications for development orders and development permits shall not be 
approved unless there is a demonstration that sufficient available wastewater collection and 
regional treatment capacity will exist to collect and treat, to all federal, state, and county 
standards for effluent discharge, wastewater generated by the development concurrent with the 
impacts of such development. Wastewater unit generation rates by land use activity category 
shall be as provided by the county concurrency information center or developed through other 
appropriate methodologies which shall meet professionally accepted standards pursuant to 
Rule 9J-5.005 of the Florida Administrative Code. 
(3) ?Solid waste. Applications for development orders and development permits shall not be 
approved unless there is a demonstration that sufficient available solid waste collection, 
treatment, and disposal capacity will exist to process solid waste generated by the development 
concurrent with the impacts of such development. Solid waste unit generation rates by land 
use/activity category shall be as provided by the county concurrency information center or 
developed through appropriate methodologies which shall meet professionally accepted 
standards pursuant to Rule 9J-5.005 of the Florida Administrative Code. 
(4) ?Drainage. Applications for development orders and development permits shall not be approved 
unless there is a demonstration that stormwater drainage systems on- and off-site will exist of 
sufficient capacity to accommodate the runoff from a storm of 24-hour duration that statistically 
occurs once in ten years, as provided in policy 2-3 of the City comprehensive plan sanitary 
sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water and natural groundwater aquifer recharge element, 
concurrent with the impacts of such development. 
(5) ?Potable water applications for development orders and development permits shall not be 
approved unless there is a demonstration that potable water treatment and distribution capacity 
will exist sufficient to accommodate the demand to be generated by the development, 
concurrent with the impacts of such development. Potable water demand generation rates by 
land use/activity category shall be as provided by the county concurrency information center or 
developed through appropriate methodologies which shall meet professionally accepted 
standards pursuant to Rule 9J-5.005 of the Florida Administrative Code. Treatment system 
capacity, delivery pressure, fire flow, water quality standards, an storage capacity shall be as 
provided in policy 2A(1.) of the county comprehensive development master plan water, sewer, 
and solid waste element. 
(6) ?Public recreation. Applications for residential development orders and development permits 
shall not be approved unless there is a demonstration that local park and recreation capacity 
will exist sufficient to accommodate the public recreation needs of the resident population of 
such development, concurrent with the impacts of such development. Local park capacity shall 
be determined as set forth in policy 1-3 of the City comprehensive plan recreation and open 
space element. In calculating and estimating demand, the City Manager or his designee may 
apply a nonresident utilization factor. 
(H) ?Geographic and jurisdictional scope concurrency determinations. Nothing with divisions (A) through 
(G) above shall be interpreted as limiting the geographic or jurisdictional scope of required 
concurrency determinations with respect to impacted public facilities and service delivery systems. 
The geographic and jurisdictional scope of concurrency determinations respecting public facilities 
and services shall be determined in each case by the City Manager or his designee, giving due 
consideration to the unique attributes of each development proposal, its location, character, timing 
and magnitude, and the unique circumstances surrounding each. 
(I) ?Developments of regional impact. The regional impact review requirement of F.S. Chapter 380 for 
developments of regional impact shall not be construed as superseding the facility and service 
impact review requirements of this section, it being the legislative intent of this section to address 
local, as well as county and regional, impacts, as appropriate. Hence these requirements are 
considered supplemental to those of F.S. Chapter 380 for developments of regional impact. 
(J) ?Appeal of project impact estimates. The applicant or any substantially effected person may appeal 
the project impact estimates of the City Manager or his designee as provided in § 150-111(B)(1).

right to reject the submission of any "recent property survey" or existing survey, in its sole and 
exclusive judgment, and require any applicant to secure and submit a "new" property survey to 
the City prior to the issuance of a building permit or the consideration of the granting of any 
variance. 
(D) ?Responsibility for additional information. If any required information is omitted from the survey 
submitted for utilization by any of the aforesaid methods of the compliance with the City's "recent" 
property survey requirement, it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the applicant to 
secure and provide such required additional information to the City staff prior to the issuance of a 
building permit or the granting of any variance for the subject property. 
(E) ?Non-applicability. Nothing contained herein shall in any manner limit or restrict the already 
established requirements for property surveys during and at the conclusion of construction of 
property improvements provided in this Code, the Florida Building Code, or any other rule, 
regulation, policy, code, statute, or law of the county or the State of Florida.

(K) ?Supplemental regulations. 
(1) ?Construction and workmanship standards. All permanent signs shall conform to state building 
code, including Chapter 23 relative to wind pressure standards. In addition, all signs shall be 
constructed, attached, painted or otherwise applied in a neat professional manner according to 
standard industry practice. 
(2) ?Electric standards. All electrical equipment and lines used as or in connection with signs shall 
meet the National Electric Code. 
(3) ?Maintenance required. All signs must be maintained in good condition. They shall be kept neat 
and safe at all times. Any evidence of sign deterioration shall be deemed a violation of this 
provision. Such evidence shall include, but not be limited to, peeling or cracking paint, severely 
fading paint, rust, cracking plastic or other deteriorating material. 
(4) ?Finished appearance required for rear of signs. Where the rear or side of any sign is visible 
from any street or from any adjoining residential district, said side of rear shall be finished with a 
neat surface which conceals the structural members and electrical equipment of the sign. 
(5) ?Illuminated signs facing residential districts restricted. No illuminated signs shall face a 
residential district in such a way that it shines directly onto residential properties. 
(6) ?Changeable copy permitted. Signs with removable or changeable copy are permitted. They 
shall count as a sign otherwise permitted by this section. They shall not be permitted in addition 
to any sign otherwise permitted by this section. 
(7) ?Required sign-theme design plan. 
(a) ?Each application for a permit for a permanent commercial sign shall be based on a written 
and graphic sign-theme design plan which establishes a unified design theme for all signs 
on a given zoning lot. For the purposes of this division, a unified design theme shall be the 
theme which has a degree of unity among the various signs with respect to the various 
design elements which together make up the design character of signs. These elements 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, construction type, materials, color, size of letters, 
size of logos and other graphics, size of signs, elevation of sign base lines, and elevation 
of sign top lines. The degree of unity required is that which clearly evidences that all 
permanent signs on the parcel were designed in concert with one another and with the 
architecture on which they are placed rather than without regard to one another or the 
architecture. It is not necessary for all signs to be identical or even nearly identical in order 
for sufficient unity to be achieved. 
(b) ?Sign-theme design plans shall be submitted to and reviewed by the site plan review 
authority. 
(c) ?An approved sign-theme design plan may be modified provided that all signs which 
already exist on the applicable parcel conform as they are to the new plan or are made to 
conform within 60 days of approval of the new plan. Any pre-existing sign which does not 
conform to an approval sign-theme design plan shall be deemed to be an illegal 
nonconforming sign and therefore shall enjoy none of the grandfather protections enjoyed 
by legal nonconformities. Such an illegal nonconforming sign shall be subject to immediate 
removal by the City at the expense of the owner of the property on which the sign is 
located. 
(d) ?Any otherwise legal sign existing prior to the enactment of this division and for which there 
is no approved sign-theme design plan may remain without time limit and without the need 
to prepare and have approved a sign-theme design plan. However, no additional or new 
signs may be placed on the lot on which such sign is located. 
(L) ?Administration and enforcement. 
(1) ?Permits and applications for permits for certain signs. Applications for permits shall be 
submitted on forms provided by the Code Enforcement Department. The following signs shall 
be required to have a sign permit: 
(a) ?Building identification sign 
(b) ?Commercial special event sign 
(c) ?Contractor/architect signs 
(d) ?Development identification sign 
(e) ?Ground sign 
(f) ?Model sign 
(g) ?Project construction sign 
(h) ?Projecting architectural sign 
(i) ?Wall sign, nonprojecting 
(j) ?Window sign, permanent 
(2) ?Minimum plan requirements. 
(a) ?Sign permit applicants shall provide plans and specifications for each sign showing all 
information necessary to determine compliance with this Code, including, where 
applicable, the approved sign-theme design plan. The plans and specifications shall also 
show the method of construction and attachment to the building or in the ground. 
(b) ?Drawings shall be to scale and shall show the square foot area and dimensions of the sign 
structure as well as the sign face, copy to appear on the sign, height of letters, colors, 
materials, lighting equipment, of any, and the position of the proposed signs relative to 
buildings, property lines, and/or other wall signs as appropriate. A survey or drawn plot 
plan with measurements shall be provided for signs which are not mounted on buildings. 
(3) ?Issuance of sign permit. If the sign, as indicated in the plans and specifications, is in 
accordance with the provisions of the state building code, and this chapter and any other 
relevant provisions of the City's Development Code, then a permit shall be issued for the 
erection of any such sign upon payment of the prescribed fee as established by the City 
provided that: 
(a) ?The sign company has secured a certificate of competency and satisfies the City's 
insurance requirements, and 
(b) ?The establishment to which the sign pertains has a valid occupational license. 
(4) ?Noncomplying signs. 
(a) ?Unsafe signs. Upon inspection by the City, if any sign is found to be unsafe, then the 
owner of the property on which said sign is located shall be required to make it safe in a 
manner consistent with all requirements of this Code or to remove such sign. If notice of 
need for corruption is not complied with within one week, the City shall cause such sign to 
be removed at the expense of the owner of the property on which the sign is located 
following a public hearing with due notice to all interested parties. Any sign deemed an 
immediate threat to public safety may be immediately removed by the City at the expense 
of the owner of the property on which the sign is located. 
(b) ?Damaged legal nonconforming signs. Any legal nonconforming sign which is damaged 
shall be removed if the cost of repair would exceed 50 percent of its original cost. The City 
shall determine whether or not damage exceeds 50 percent of its original costs following a 
public hearing. 
(c) ?Unmaintained signs. Any sign not maintained according to the requirements of this Code 
may be removed by the City at the expense of the owner of the property on which the sign 
is located following a public hearing with due notice to all interested parties. 
(d) ?Electric violations. Any electric sign installed at any location that does not conform with the 
National Electric Code or that violates the ordinances of the City shall, upon notice by the 
chief electrical inspector, be discontinued immediately from service by the owner until 
made to conform with this Code and is subsequently approved by the electrical and/or 
building inspectors. Upon failure to so discontinue service until conformation with this 
section, the City shall have the power, authority and duty to discontinue and disconnect the 
unlawful or nonconforming installation, at the expense of the owner of the property on 
which the sign is located. 
(e) ?Removal off illegal nonconforming signs. Signs shall be determined to be illegal 
nonconforming signs only following a public hearing with due notice to all interested 
parties. Any sign so determined to be an illegal nonconforming sign shall be removed 
within 30 days of notification to the owner of the property on which the sign is located. The 
City may remove any such sign if the owner fails to comply with this requirement for 
removal. The expense of such removal shall be charged to the owner of the property on 
which the sign is located. 
(5) ?Enforcement. 
(a) ?Sign contrary to provisions. No sign shall be permitted to be erected, installed or applied in 
the City contrary to the provisions of this section.

ARTICLE VI. - TOWNHOUSE DISTRICT 


Sec. 150-065. - R-TH townhouse district. 
(A) ?General provisions. 
(1) ?Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide a townhouse zoning district in order to 
permit separate ownership of one-family dwelling units upon compliance with certain rules, 
regulations, and standards, and to authorize the grouping of separately owned one-family 
dwelling units into townhouses in such a manner as to make efficient, economical, and 
aesthetically pleasing use of land, so restricted that the same will be continually well maintained 
in order to preserve the health, welfare, safety, morals, and convenience of the neighborhood 
and surrounding area. 
(2) ?Definition. As used in this section, a townhouse is a one-family dwelling unit of a group of three 
or more such units separated by a common party fire wall. The common party fire wall shall 
extend to the roof line or above the roof of units which it serves, and shall be constructed of 
eight-inch thick, steel reinforced masonry block, brick, or poured concrete and shall have no 
openings therein. Where units are offset from one another and a common party wall is used, the 
wall may be placed equidistant on each side of the lot line, not exceeding the length of the 
offset. Each townhouse unit shall be constructed upon a separate lot and serviced with separate 
utilities and other facilities and shall otherwise be independent of one another. 
(B) ?Uses permitted. Those uses permitted in the R-1D district and conforming to the regulations for that 
district as provided in § 150-044. 
(C) ?Restrictions. Townhouses are subject to the following restrictions. 
(1) ?Densities. The maximum number of units per net acre shall not exceed ten. 
(2) ?Grouping length. A grouping of townhouses shall not exceed 150 feet in length and shall not 
contain more than six units. 
(3) ?Unit size. No townhouse shall be smaller than 900 square feet, and the average size of the 
townhouses in any grouping shall be a minimum of 1,100 square feet. 
(4) ?Height. No townhouse shall exceed two stories or 35 feet in height. The height of abutting 
townhouse units shall vary by plus or minus five feet. 
(5) ?Development site street frontage. The minimum continuous street frontage required for a site to 
be developed for townhouses shall be 250 lineal feet. 
(6) ?Lot area for each unit. No townhouse unit site shall contain an area of less than 2,000 square 
feet, and each unit shall have its foundation on its individual site, except where the units are 
separated by a common party wall in which event the foundation may be installed equidistant on 
each side of the lot line for the length of the party wall and its extension along the offset of the 
townhouses on abutting lots. 
(7) ?Front yard requirements. The front setback shall vary with adjacent townhouse units by a 
minimum of three feet to create a staggered front and roof line within each attached grouping; 
however, there shall be a 15-foot minimum distance from the front property line to the closest 
front building line. If a garage is provided at the front of the townhouse unit, the garage portion 
of the structure shall be set back not less than 20 feet from the front property line. The front yard 
is to be maintained as landscaped open space with no vehicular parking permitted therein, and 
it shall be enclosed with a 30-inch high, City-approved, ornamental wall constructed along each 
front property line and along each side lot line or common boundary line, or along the driveway 
entrance if a garage is provided at the front. 
(8) ?Rear yard requirements. The minimum rear building setback shall be 25 feet. 
(9) ?Side yard requirements. A minimum side yard of 15 feet shall be provided between the end of a 
group of townhouses and a public or private street or alley.

accessways complying with private street requirements. 
(11) ?Utilities and services. Each townhouse shall be independently served by separate heating, air 
conditioning, sewer, water, electrical power, gas, and other facility and utility services, and no 
townhouse shall be in any way dependent upon services or utility lines located within another 
unit, or on, or in another townhouse or townhouse site, except as may be installed in public 
easements. All townhouses must be connected to water and sewer lines and all electrical and 
telephone lines in a townhouse development site shall be placed underground. Proper and 
adequate access for firefighting purposes, and access to service areas to provide garbage and 
waste collection, and for other necessary services shall be provided. 
(12) ?Parking standards and requirements. See § 150-016. 
(13) ?Walls. All patio, outdoor living areas on each townhouse site shall be enclosed by a wall 
affording complete screening except in cases where a natural feature of the site such as a lake 
or golf course would suggest that complete screening would not be required. This determination 
shall be made as a result of the site plan review process as provided herein. The wall shall be of 
masonry or other material having a life expectancy of not less than ten years and the minimum 
height of the wall shall be six feet; the walled-in patio may include a screen roof. All rear yard

without expense to the general taxpayer of Miami Springs. This may be provided by the incorporation 
of an automatic membership home association for the purpose of continuously holding title to the 
nonpublic areas and facilities, and levying assessment against each townhouse lot, whether 
improved or not, for the purpose of paying the taxes and maintaining the nonpublic areas and 
facilities which may include, but not be limited to, recreational areas, off-street parking bays, private 
streets, sidewalks, streetlights, and common open and landscaped areas. The assessments shall be 
a lien superior to all other liens save and except tax liens and mortgage liens, provided the mortgage 
liens are first liens against the property encumbered thereby, subject only to tax liens, and secure 
indebtedness which are amortized in monthly or quarter-annual payments over a period of not less 
than ten years. Other methods may be acceptable if they positively provide for the proper and 
continuous payment of taxes and maintenance without expense to the general taxpayers. The 
instrument incorporating the provisions shall be approved by the City Attorney as to form and legal 
sufficiency and shall be recorded in the public records of the county at the time of the recording of 
the subdivision plat.

insure that the owner and developer will comply with the requirements and provisions of this section, 
or such other security as may be deemed appropriate by the City Council.

(1) ?Application fee. Each application filed with the building and zoning department shall be 
accompanied by the payment of a nonreturnable fee in the minimum amount of $300.00 or

processing and reviewing the application for development. 
(2) ?Reimbursement to City. The applicant shall reimburse the City for the cost of any legal or 
engineering services which exceed the usual and normal amount of services rendered to the 
City in reviewing or processing any application, so long as the additional services were required 
as a result of the applicant and his application. 
(3) ?Review. The City Planning and Zoning Board shall have the responsibility to review all site and 
development plans and to make recommendations for modifications, approval, or denial to the 
City Council in accordance with division (D)(1) above and §§ 150-101150-102.

ARTICLE X. - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS 


Sec. 150-095. - Wireless telecommunication towers and antennas. 
(A) ?Intent. The regulations, requirements, and standards contained herein are intended to establish 
procedures and guidelines for the siting of wireless telecommunication towers and antennas and to 
accomplish the following: 
(1) ?To protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the 
City. 
(2) ?To protect the residential areas and other appropriate land uses from the potential adverse 
impacts of towers and antennas. 
(3) ?To encourage the location of towers and antennas in nonresidential areas and to locate such 
facilities, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is 
minimal. 
(4) ?To minimize the total number of towers and antennas throughout the community by strongly 
encouraging the co-location of antennas on new preexisting tower sites as a primary option 
rather than the construction of additional single-use towers. 
(5) ?To encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a manner that minimizes their 
adverse visual impact on the adjacent community by utilizing careful design, siting, landscape 
screening and innovative camouflaging techniques. 
(6) ?To enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunication services to provide such services 
to the community through an efficient and timely process. 
    In furtherance of the foregoing, the City shall, however, provide appropriate consideration to its 
master plan, Zoning Code and map, existing land uses, and all environmentally sensitive areas in 
approving sites for proposed wireless telecommunication towers and antennas. 
(B) ?Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, 
which shall control over any other definitions contained in the City's Code of Ordinances. 
(1) ?Antenna means a transmitting and/or receiving device mounted on a tower, building or 
structure and used in telecommunications [personal wireless] services that radiates or captures 
electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio frequencies, directional antennas 
such as panel and microwave dish antennas, and omnidirectional antennas such as whips, but 
excluding radar antennas, amateur radio antennas and satellite earth stations. 
(2) ?Guyed tower means a telecommunications tower that is supported in whole or in part, by guy 
wires and ground anchors. 
(3) ?Lattice tower means a communication tower that is constructed to be self-supporting by lattice 
type supports and without the use of guy wires or other supports. 
(4) ?Microwave dish antenna means a dish-like antenna used to link communication [personal 
wireless service] sites together by wireless transmission of voice or data. 
(5) ?Monopole tower means a communication tower consisting of a single pole or spire self-
supported on a permanent foundation, constructed without guy wires, ground anchors, or other 
supports. 
(6) ?Pre-existing towers and pre-existing antennas means any tower or antenna for which a building 
permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this section. 
(7) ?Stealth facility means any telecommunications facility which is designed to blend into the 
surrounding environment. For example, architecturally screened roof mounted antennae, 
building-mounted antennae painted to match the existing structure, antennae integrated into 
architectural elements, and communication towers designed to look like light poles, power 
poles, or trees. 
(8) ?Telecommunications facility means a facility that is used to provide one or more 
telecommunications services, including, without limitation, radio transmitting towers, other 
supporting structures, and associated facilities used to transmit telecommunications signals. An 
open video system is not a telecommunications facility to the extent that it provides only cable 
service. 
(9) ?Telecommunications services means the offering of telecommunication (or the transmission, 
between or among points, specified by the user of information of the user's choosing, without 
charge in the form or content of the information as sent and received), for a fee directly to the 
public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless 
of the facilities used. Personal wireless communication services shall not be considered as 
essential services, public utilities or private utilities. 
(10) ?Telecommunications tower means any structure, and support thereto, designed and 
constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas intended for 
transmitting or receiving personal wireless services, telephone, radio and similar communication 
purposes, including lattice, monopole and guyed towers. The term includes radio and television 
transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, 
alternative tower structures, among others. 
(11) ?Whip antenna means a cylindrical antenna that transmits signals 360 degrees. 
(C) ?Applicability. All new towers or antennas in the City shall be subject to these regulations. However, 
this section shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is for the use of a 
broadcasting facility owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is 
used exclusively for "receive only" antennas. 
(D) ?General requirements and standards. Every new telecommunications tower and antenna shall be 
subject to the following minimum standards. 
(1) ?Lease required. Any construction, installation, or placement of a telecommunications facility on 
any property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the City shall require a lease agreement 
executed by the City and the owner of the facility. No lease granted in regard to this section 
shall convey any exclusive right, privilege, permit or franchise to occupy or use the public lands 
of the City for delivery of telecommunication services or any other purpose. In addition, no lease 
granted under this Section shall convey any right title or interest in the public lands other than a 
leasehold interest, but shall be deemed only to allow the use of the public lands for the limited 
purposes and term stated in the lease. No lease shall be construed as a conveyance of a title 
interest in the property. 
(2) ?Review of existing sites/application for use. 
(a) ?Each applicant shall review all existing towers, antennas, and approved sites in the City 
prior to filing an application for construction of any new tower or antenna. All requests for 
sites shall include specific information about the proposed location, height, and design of 
the proposed towers. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates 
to the reasonable satisfaction of the City that there is no existing tower, structure or state of 
the art technology that does not require the use of new towers or new structures to 
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna and that the new tower will be constructed 
in a manner that will permit, accommodate and encourage future co-location thereon by 
other telecommunication providers. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing 
tower, structure or state of the art technology is suitable shall consist of any of the 
following: 
(i) ?An evaluation of the feasibility of sharing a tower, indicating that existing towers or 
structures located within the geographic search area, as determined by a radio frequency 
engineer, do not have the capacity to provide reasonable technical service consistent with 
the applicant's technical system, including but not limited to, applicable FCC requirements. 
(ii) ?Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's 
requirements which are, in turn, in compliance with all applicable FCC rules and 
regulations. 
(iii) ?Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support 
applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
(iv) ?That applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic/radio frequency 
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the 
existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed 
antenna. 
(v) ?The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an 
existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are 
unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be 
unreasonable. 
(vi) ?The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers 
and structures unsuitable. 
(vii) ?The applicant demonstrates that state of the art technology used in the wireless 
telecommunications business, and within the scope of applicant's FCC license, is 
unsuitable. Costs of state of the art technology that exceed new tower or antenna 
development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(b) ?The City may share such information with other applicants or other organizations seeking 
to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City provided, however, that the City is not, 
by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such information is 
accurate or that such sites are available or suitable. 
(3) ?Engineering report. 
(a) ?All applicants for new towers and towers which are to be modified or reconstructed to 
accommodate additional antennas shall submit a written report certified by a professional 
engineer licensed to practice in the State of Florida. The report shall include: 
(i) ?Site development plan, drawn to scale, including without limitation, a legal description of 
the parent tract and leased parcel, if applicable, onsite and adjacent land uses, master plan 
classification of the site, and a visual impact analysis and photo digitalization of the tower 
and all attachments, including associated buildings and equipment containers at the 
property line, as well as at a distance of 250 feet and 500 feet from all properties adjacent 
to the proposed site. 
(ii) ?If applicable, a narrative of why the proposed tower cannot comply with the requirements 
as stated in this section. 
(iii) ?Type of tower and specifics of design. 
(iv) ?Current wind-loading capacity and a projection of wind-loading capacity using difference 
types of antennas as contemplated by the applicant No tower shall be permitted to exceed 
its wind-loading capacity. 
(v) ?A statement that the proposed tower, including reception and transmission functions, will 
not interfere with the visual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television or 
similar services as well as other wireless services enjoyed by adjacent residential and 
nonresidential properties. 
(vi) ?A statement of compliance with all applicable building codes, associated regulations and 
safety standards. For all towers attached to existing structures, the statement shall include 
certification that the structure can support the load superimposed from the tower. All towers 
shall have the capacity to permit multiple users and be designed and constructed in such a 
manner as to accommodate all anticipated advancements in technology that will allow the 
expanded multiple use thereof At a minimum, monopole towers shall be able to 
accommodate four users, and, at a minimum, self-support lattice or guyed towers shall be 
able to accommodate five users. 
(vii) ?Any additional information deemed by the City to be necessary to assess compliance 
with this section. 
(4) ?Co-Location. Pursuant to the intent of this section, co-location of telecommunication antennas 
by more than one provider on existing telecommunication towers shall take precedence over the 
construction of new telecommunications towers. Accordingly, in addition to submitting the 
information previously required herein, each application shall include a written report certified by

(b) ?Mechanical or electrical incompatibility. 
(c) ?Any restrictions or limitations of the Federal Communications Commission that would 
preclude the shared use of the tower. 
(d) ?Any additional information required by the City. 
If the City does not accept the full evaluation as provided as accurate, or if the City 
disagrees with any part of the evaluation required by this section, the application review 
process shall be halted until a review and evaluation meeting with the City Manager can be 
jointly conducted by and between the City administrative staff, its professional advisors and 
the applicant. This meeting shall be scheduled as soon as is reasonably possible once a 
review disagreement is determined to exist. 
(5) ?Co-Location; tenant rental fees. Pursuant to the intent of this section, the City shall provide the 
following incentives to service providers: 
(a) ?The review of all applications submitted by providers seeking to co-locate on a pre-
existing tower or to rent space on a proposed new tower, shall be completed by the City on 
an expedited basis following the filing of a completed application as required by this 
section. 
(b) ?In order to be consistent with the City's intent to encourage co-location in every possible 
appropriate circumstance, tower owners regulated by this section shall not charge 
providers seeking to co-locate on the tower in excess of the fair market value for the space, 
as determined at the time of the request for co-location. Any attempt by a tower owner to 
discourage co-location by changing rates in violation of this provision shall be subject to 
appropriate sanctions as provided in the lease documents between the City and the tower 
owner. 
(6) ?Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements: 
(a) ?Towers shall, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so 
as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(b) ?At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent 
possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them 
into the natural setting and surrounding buildings to minimize the visual impact. 
(c) ?All tower sites must provide all reasonable landscaping that the City may require in order 
to enhance compatibility with adjacent residential and nonresidential land uses. All 
landscaping shall be properly maintained to ensure good health and viability at the owner's 
expense. Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that 
effectively screens the view of the tower compound consisting of the telecommunications 
tower and antennas, network connection equipment and any structure or equipment 
cabinet from all adjacent properties. The minimum landscape buffer area shall consist of a 
landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the tower compound. 
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the 
maximum extent possible. If trees are removed for the tower construction, the tower owner 
must replace all removed trees elsewhere on the site, relocate or plant like trees in other 
areas of the City to be designated by the City Building Department, or make an appropriate 
contribution to the City tree replacement trust fund. In some cases, such as towers sited on 
large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be utilized to provide 
the required landscape buffer area. 
(d) ?If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting 
electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or 
closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna 
and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(7) ?Lighting. No signals, artificial lights, or illumination shall be permitted on any antenna or tower 
unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting 
alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(8) ?Setbacks. Towers must be set back a minimum distance of 110 percent of the height of the 
tower. 
(9) ?Separation. Each tower shall be separated from any other tower by a distance of no less than 
one mile as measured by a straight line between the bases of the towers. 
(10) ?Height. The maximum height for any tower shall be 150 feet. 
(11) ?Local, state or federal requirements. The construction, operation and repair of 
telecommunication facilities are subject to the supervision of the City, and shall be performed in 
compliance with all laws, ordinances and practices affecting such system. The construction, 
operation and repair shall be performed in a manner consistent with applicable industry 
standards, including the electronic industries association. all telecommunication towers and 
antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, 
including emissions standards, and any other agency of the local, state or federal government 
with the authority to regulate towers and antennas prior to issuance of a building permit by the 
City. If such applicable standards and regulations require retroactive application, then the 
owners of the towers and antennas government by this section shall bring such towers and 
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the 
effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a difference compliance schedule is 
mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into 
compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the 
removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
(12) ?Building codes, safely standards. 
(a) ?To insure the structural integrity of towers, the owner shall construct and maintain the 
tower in compliance with the South Florida Building Code, and all other applicable codes 
and standards, as may be amended from time to time. A statement shall be submitted by a 
professional engineer certifying compliance with this subsection. Where a preexisting 
structure, including light and power poles, is requested as a stealth facility, the facility, and 
all modifications thereof, shall comply with all requirements as provided in this section. 
Following the issuance of a building permit, the City shall require an analysis of a soil 
sample from the base of the tower site. 
(b) ?If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and 
standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being 
provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have no more than 30 days to bring 
such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into 
compliance within 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna 
at the owner's expense. 
(13) ?Warning signs. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions contained in the City's Code of 
Ordinance, the following shall be utilized in connection with any tower or antenna site, as 
applicable. 
(a) ?If high voltage is necessary for the operation of the communication tower or any accessory 
structures, "HIGH VOLTAGE-DANGER" warning signs shall be permanently attached to 
the fence or wall surrounding the structure and spaced no more than 40 feet apart.

(1) ?A full and complete review of the application and all other required information and 
documentation by all appropriate City departments under the coordination of the City Building 
Department. 
(2) ?An engineering review of the proposed plan, drawn to scale, of each proposed usage site 
which identifies proposed landscaping and includes elevation drawings of the antenna tower 
and any appurtenant facilities. 
(3) ?The applicant to provide evidence of the status of title for the proposed antenna tower site, in a 
form required by the City Attorney's office, to assure the City that all necessary owners, 
easement holders, tenants, and other interested parties have consented to the application. 
(4) ?The applicant to certify that the tower or antenna proposed will be kept in continual compliance 
with all present and future promulgated safety laws, rules and regulations concerning 
electromagnetic frequency emissions standards, or similar safety standards for other 
communication media transmissions, and shall acknowledge the City's ability to require 
immediate removal of any antenna which does not meet such safety rules and regulations. This 
enforceable certification shall be in form approved by the City Attorney's office and shall be 
binding on the applicant's successors in interest. The certification shall enable the City to 
recover its costs and attorney's fees if litigation is necessary to enforce the certification. 
(5) ?The applicant to further certify that any antenna(s) proposed for any tower or other location-site 
will not interfere with public safety communications, and further, will not unreasonably interfere 
with the reception or transmission of television, radio, microwave, telephone, digital, or similar

may, as a condition for approval, require frequency relocation agreements as a condition of 
approval of the application. 
(6) ?The applicant to state in its application that it will, as a condition of issuance of the permit, 
accommodate antenna facilities of other providers, on a nondiscriminatory basis, to avoid 
duplication of the erection of such antennas throughout the City, or if not, the reasons, based 
upon verifiable objective data, why it cannot do so. Unreasonable refusal to permit co-use shall 
constitute a violation of the Code and may result in the City revoking any previously granted 
antenna tower approval and seeking a mandatory injunction to compel the antenna tower's 
removal in addition to other remedies for code violations. 
(F) ?Application review procedure. Following the administrative review of a pending application and all 
other information and documentation required by this section by all City departments, which is 
intended to be conducted within a reasonable period of time, the City Building Department shall 
request that the application be placed on the next regular agenda of the City Zoning and Planning 
Board for review and approval. After being reviewed by the Zoning and Planning Board, regardless 
of the board's decision on the pending application, the City Council shall then review the application 
and its supporting information and documentation, and the decision of the Zoning and Planning 
Board, at a public hearing to be noticed and advertised in the same manner as required for all public 
hearings of the City. The decision of the City Council at the scheduled public hearing shall constitute 
final City action on the pending application. 
(G) ?Siting preferences. 
(1) ?The City shall encourage the location of antenna tower sites on public property consistent with 
the intent of the congressional legislation on this subject. Accordingly, when evaluating an 
antenna tower application, the City shall consider whether there is suitable public property near 
the proposed site which would physically accommodate the antenna tower without 
unreasonably compromising the antenna tower's signal reception or transmitting capability or 
unreasonably compromising the communication system's capability and without significantly 
increasing any negative antenna tower secondary effects such as aesthetics or the likelihood of 
property damage in the event of antenna tower failure. 
(2) ?If an antenna tower cannot be located on public property without unreasonably compromising 
the antenna tower's signal reception or transmission capability, or unreasonably compromising 
the communication system's capability, the City will next consider sites in industrial zoned 
districts, sites in business or office zoned districts, or sites in community facility zoned districts 
which are not subject to government ownership or use. 
(3) ?If an antenna tower cannot be located on any of the secondary preference sites stated in 
subparagraph (2) above without unreasonably compromising the antenna tower's signal 
reception or transmission capability or unreasonably compromising the communication system's 
capability, the City will consider sites in the multifamily zoned districts of the City for the antenna 
tower site. 
(4) ?If an antenna tower cannot be located on any of the secondary preference sites stated in 
subparagraphs (2) or (3) above without unreasonably compromising the antenna tower's signal 
reception or transmission capability or unreasonably compromising the communication system's 
capability, the City will consider sites in the single-family zoned districts of the City for the 
antenna tower site. 
(5) ?The City shall also consider the following factors in regard to all siting preference evaluations: 
(a) ?Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or state of the ad technologies not 
requiring the use of towers or structures.

residential units or residentially zoned properties. 
(d) ?Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries.

experts when evaluation siting preferences and may defer considering applications for up to 60 
days to permit good faith negotiations to occur between an applicant and a property owner of a 
preferred site class. Moreover, it will be presumed that if a proposed site is within one mile of an 
existing antenna tower that can reasonably accommodate the applicant's antenna, a denial of 
the application would not result in an unreasonable compromise to the applicant's 
communication system capability or an unreasonable compromise to the antenna tower's 
reception or transmission capability. 
(H) ?Public property special conditions. The City reserves the right to modify or waive any of the 
requirements provided in this section for the siting of wireless telecommunication towers and 
antennas on publicly owned property. However, any determination to modify or waive any ordinance 
requirements must be approved by the City Council at the public hearing conducted to consider the 
application for the approval of the requested telecommunications facilities.

square feet of gross floor area and the cabinet/structure is located a minimum of five feet 
from all lot lines. The cabinet/structure shall be screened by a hedge with a planted height 
of at least 48 inches. Alternatively, in a rear yard setback, provided the cabinet or structure

continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or 
tower shall remove the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of 
such abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned antenna or tower within the 90-day period shall 
constitute grounds for the City to remove the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. If there are 
two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users 
cease using the tower. 
(K) ?Nonconforming uses.

its behalf) have adequate insurance. At a minimum, the following requirements must be 
satisfied: 
(i) ?A telecommunications facility operator shall not commence construction or operation of any 
facility without obtaining all the insurance coverages that may be required, and the

policies will not be canceled until at least 30 days prior written notice has been received by 
the City. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of 
the State of Florida. 
(iv) ?In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall 
terminate or lapse during the period of the lease agreement with the City, then in that 
event, the communications facility operator shall furnish, at least 30 days prior to the

the City Council.

referred to as the "City master plan"), as it applies to a portion of the area of the City, is outdated, 
and of little or no use in formulating correct zoning patterns in relation thereto, or as to whether

(1) ?Purpose, authority and findings. 
(a) ?Purpose. In the development and enforcement of this subsection 150-165D., "Adult-
related business regulations," the City recognizes that adult-related businesses, because 
of their very nature, have serious objectionable characteristics and have a deleterious 
effect upon adjacent business and residential areas. It is desirable, therefore, to protect the 
well-being of the youth of the City from the objectionable operational characteristics of 
these adult-related businesses by locating them away from residential areas and public 
facilities used frequently by minors, such as schools, religious facilities, parks, instructional 
schools serving minors, and day care centers. The City finds that, just as advertising is 
designed to stimulate one's appetite for desired goods and services, an overabundance or 
preoccupation with sexual displays or materials arouses the appetites of those so 
preoccupied, and encourages criminal sexual behavior. 
In recognition of the protections afforded to the citizens of the United States under the First 
and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, it is neither the intent 
nor the effect of this subsection to: 
(i) ?Inhibit freedom of speech or the press; or 
(ii) ?Limit or restrict the content of any communicative materials, including sexually 
oriented materials; or 
(iii) ?Restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First 
Amendment; or 
(iv) ?Deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to 
their intended market; or 
(v) ?Regulate obscenity, which is regulated by general law (Chapter 847, Florida 
Statutes). 
This subsection balances the legitimate governmental purposes of the City against the 
above-described constitutional rights, by imposing incidental, content-neutral place, time, 
and manner regulations of adult-related businesses without limiting alternative avenues of 
communication. The regulations deemed necessary to control the undesirable effects 
arising from these businesses are set forth in this subsection. Licensing and operational 
regulations for these uses are in Chapter 132 of this Code. 
(b) ?Authority. This subsection is enacted pursuant to the City's home rule power to enact 
regulations to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the City's residents, 
and Chapters 163 and 166, Florida Statutes.

1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005; 
the City Council finds as follows: 
(i) ?Establishments exist or may exist within the City where books, magazines, motion 
pictures, videos, prints, photographs, periodicals, records, novelties, and devices that 
depict, illustrate, describe, or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, 
displayed, exhibited, distributed, and sold. 
(ii) ?Establishments exist or may exist within the City where: 
a. ?The superficial tissues of one person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded, 
or tapped by a second person, accompanied by the display or exposure of 
specified anatomical areas; 
[b. ?Dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for] forms of 
commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified 
anatomical areas; or 
c. ?Lap dancing occurs. 
(iii) ?The activities described in subsections (c)(i) and (ii) occur at establishments for the 
purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the City in the 
interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of City residents. 
(iv) ?The competitive commercial exploitation of such nudity and seminudity is adverse to 
the public's interest, quality of life, tone of commerce, and total community 
environment. 
(v) ?The commercial exploitation of nudity and seminudity consists of the use of nude and 
seminude entertainment in connection with or for the promotion of the sale of goods or 
services, and the receipt of money by the person engaging in nude or seminude 
entertainment in exchange for or as consideration for nude or seminude performance 
by such individuals. 
(vi) ?The commercial exploitation of nude and seminude acts, exhibitions, and nude 
entertainment occurs frequently at commercial establishments either selling or 
allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises. 
(vii) ?There is a direct relationship between the consumption of alcoholic beverages and 
the nude and seminude activities mentioned above, and an increase in criminal 
activities, disturbances of the peace and good order of the community. The 
occurrence of these activities is hazardous to the health and the safety of those 
persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and 
harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. 
(viii) ?The combination of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the 
performance of nude and seminude acts, exhibitions and entertainment is adverse to 
the public's interest and the quality of life, tone of commerce, and total community 
environment in the City. 
(ix) ?To promote and preserve the public peace and good order and to safeguard the 
health, safety, and welfare of the community and its citizens, it is necessary and 
advisable for the City to prohibit certain forms of nude and seminude acts, exhibitions, 
entertainment, and commercial establishments at which alcoholic beverages are, or 
are available to be, sold or consumed. 
(x) ?There is a direct relationship between the display or depiction of specified anatomical 
areas as defined in this subsection and an increase in criminal activities and 
disturbances of the peace and good order of the community, and the occurrence of 
these activities is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance 
and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and harm the economic 
welfare of the community as a whole. These secondary effects are adverse to the 
public's interest and quality of life, tone of commerce, and total community 
environment in the City. 
(xi) ?When the activities described in subsections (c)(i) and (ii) take place in 
establishments within the City, other activities that are illegal or unhealthy tend to 
accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other 
activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, solicitation for prostitution, lewd 
and lascivious behavior, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene 
materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against 
persons and property. 
(xii) ?When the activities described in subsections (c)(i) and (ii) are present in 
establishments within the City, they tend to blight neighborhoods, adversely affect 
neighboring businesses, lower property values, foster an atmosphere that promotes 
crime, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(xiii) ?The establishments used for the activities described in subsections (c)(i) and (ii) are 
frequently used for unlawful and unhealthy sexual activities, including prostitution and 
sexual liaisons of a casual nature.

the owner, agent, occupant, or architect shall appear before the City Council at the time stated in the

archeology, or culture, and possess an integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, 
or association, or meet with one of the following requirements:

(5) ?Are listed in the national register of historic places. 
(B) ?Certain properties which include cemeteries, birthplaces, properties owned by religious institutions 
or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, 
properties commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the last

they are integral parts of districts that do met the criteria, or if they fall within the following categories: 
(1) ?Religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction of 
historical importance. 
(2) ?A building or structure removed from its location but which is primarily significant for 
architectural value, or is the surviving structure most importantly associated with an historic 
event or person. 
(3) ?A birthplace or grave of an historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other 
appropriate site of building directly associated with his productive life. 
(4) ?A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent 
importance, from age, distinctive design features, or from association with historic events. 
(5) ?A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has 
invested it with its own historical significance. 
(6) ?A property or district achieving significance within the past 25 years if it is of exceptional 
importance. 
(C) ?In addition to the authority for historical designation previously described herein, but separate and 
apart from such designation authority, the Board may consider historical designation by utilization of 
a "Special Designation Category" for any qualifying area, place, structure, landscape feature, 
archaeological site, or other improvements or physical features of individual sites, districts, or 
archaeological zones. However, any designation authorized and approved by the Board for this 
"Special Designation Category" shall be limited by the following provisions:

the subject of designation by requiring regular or special certificates of appropriateness, 
certificates for demolition, reconstruction, building, excavation, or for any other renovation, site 
modification, design revision, property usage, maintenance or repair. 
5. ?Following designation within the "Special Designation Category", the Board shall exercise no 
further jurisdiction or authority over or in regard to the subject of designation.

"Special Category Designations" provided herein are declared to be invalid, inappropriate, 
improper, or otherwise contrary to law by any court of law, regulatory authority or organization, 
or other governmental organization, agency, authority, department or board which exercises 
jurisdictional control over the City's Historic Preservation Board.

Sec. 153-37. - Special certificates of appropriateness. 
(A) ?An applicant for a special certificate of appropriateness shall submit his application to the Historical 
Preservation Board pursuant to §§ 153-20153-26. The applicant shall accompany the application 
to the board with full plans and specifications, site plan, and samples of materials as deemed 
appropriate by the board to fully describe the proposed appearance, color, texture, or materials, and 
architectural design of the building and any outbuilding, wall, courtyard, fence, landscape feature, 
paving, signage, and exterior lighting. The applicant shall provide adequate information to enable the 
board to visualize the effect of the proposed action on the applicant's building and its adjacent 
buildings and streetscapes. If the application involves a designated archeological site the applicant 
shall provide full plans and specifications of work that may affect the surface and subsurface of the 
archeological site. 
(B) ?The board shall hold a public hearing on an application for a special certificate of appropriateness 
affecting property under its control. In such instances, notice and procedure of the public hearing 
shall be given to the property owners by certified mail and to other interested parties by an 
advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation. 
(C) ?The board shall approve, deny, or approve in modified form an application, subject to the 
acceptance of the modification by the applicant. The board may suspend action on the application in 
order to seek technical advice from outside its members or to meet further with the applicant to

Sec. 153-38. - Regulations governing demolition. 
(A) ?Demolition of a designated building, structure, improvement, or site may occur pursuant to an order 
of a government agency or a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to an approved application 
by the owner for a special certificate of appropriateness. 
(B) ?Government agencies having the authority to demolish unsafe structures shall receive notice of 
designation of individual sites, districts, or archeological zones pursuant to §§ 153-20153-26. The 
Historical Preservation Board shall be deemed an interested party and shall be entitled to receive 
notice of any public hearings conducted by the governmental agency regarding demolition of any 
designated property. The board may make recommendations and suggestions to the governmental 
agency and the owners relative to the feasibility of and the public interest in preserving the 
designated property. 
(C) ?No permit for voluntary demolition of a designated building, structure, improvement, or site shall be 
issued to the owner thereof until an application for a special certificate of appropriateness has been 
submitted and approved pursuant to the procedures in this section. Refusal by the board to grant a 
special certificate of appropriateness shall be evidenced by written order detailing the public interest 
which is sought to be preserved. The board shall be guided by the criteria contained in division (D) 
below. The board may grant a special certificate of appropriateness which may provide for a delayed 
effective date of up to two years. The effective date shall be determined by the board based on the 
relative significance of the structure and the probable time required to arrange a possible alternative 
to demolition. During the demolition delay period, the board may take such steps as it deems 
necessary to preserve the structure concerned, in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. 
These steps may include, but shall not be limited to, consultation with civic groups, public agencies, 
and interested citizens, recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or 
agencies, and exploration of the possibility of moving one or more structures or other features. 
(D) ?In addition to all other provisions of this chapter, the board shall consider the following criteria in 
evaluating applications for a special certificate of appropriateness for demolition of designated 
properties. 
(1) ?Is the structure of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state, or local 
criteria for designation as an historic or architectural landmark? 
(2) ?Is the structure of such design, craftsmanship, or material that it could be reproduced only with 
great difficulty or expense? 
(3) ?Is the structure one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, the county, 
or the region? 
(4) ?Does the structure contribute significantly to the historic character of designated district? 
(5) ?Would retention of the structure promote the general welfare of the county by providing an 
opportunity for study of local history, architecture, and design or by developing an 
understanding of the importance and value of a particular culture and heritage? 
(6) ?Are there definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and 
what will be the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area?

to dig. All applications to all appropriate municipal or county agencies involving new construction, 
large scale digging, the removal of trees, or any other activity that may reveal or disturb an interred 
archeological site in an archeological zone, shall require a certificate to dig before approval. Based 
on the designation report for the archeological zone, a complete application for a certificate to dig 
and any additional guidelines the Historical Preservation Board may deem necessary, the staff of the 
board shall approve or deny the application for a certificate to dig by the owners of a property in a 
designated archeological zone. The certificate to dig may be made subject to specified conditions, 
including but not limited to, conditions regarding site excavation. 
(B) ?In order to comply with the site excavation requirements of the certificate to dig, the applicant may 
agree to permit a City or county sanctioned archeologist to conduct excavation from the time of the 
approval of the certificate to dig until the effective date thereof. The findings of the staff shall be 
mailed to the applicant promptly. The applicant shall have the opportunity to challenge the staff 
decision or any conditions attached to the certificate to dig by requesting a meeting of the board. The 
board shall convene within a reasonable time and shall make every effort to review and reconsider 
the original staff decision to arrive at an equitable decision. The decision of the board shall be 
reduced to writing. 
(C) ?Approved certificates to dig shall contain an effective date at which time the proposed activity may 
begin, unless the board decides to designate the site in question as an individual site or district 
pursuant to §§ 153-20153-26 in which case all rules and regulations pertaining to the designation 
process shall apply from the date the designation report has been filed.

ARTICLE V. - RULES FOR REVIEW OF DESIGNATIONS AND ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF 
APPROPRIATENESS 


Sec. 153-55. - General guidelines for designation. 
(A) ?The designation of properties as individual sites, districts, or archeological zones will be based 
primarily on the findings of the historic survey. The historic survey is a three-year survey of Dade 
County that identifies, catalogs, documents, and evaluates sites of major architectural, historical, and 
archeological significance. All of the properties in the survey have been rated. For properties of 
primarily architectural or historical significance ratings were based on the properties' architectural, 
historical and contextual significance relative to its neighborhoods, municipality, and the county 
based on the following criteria. 
(1) ?Architectural significance. 
(a) ?Architectural style or expression of a vernacular Building form. 
(b) ?Representative buildings of South Florida architecture in their use of native materials and 
response to the tropical climate. 
(c) ?The type of construction or materials used and the quality of construction. 
(d) ?The quality of design and craftsmanship. 
(e) ?The architect or builder's prominence or contribution to the development of the county. 
(2) ?Historical significance. 
(a) ?Construction dates or approximate documented age of individual buildings or structures. 
(b) ?Previous uses associated with the site. 
(c) ?Association with a specific event or historical trend or particular community. 
(d) ?Association with a prominent person. 
(3) ?Contextual significance. 
(a) ?The visual continuity of a site with its immediate surroundings. 
(b) ?The visual contribution of a site to its immediate environment or the quality of 
enhancement a building may have with respect to other buildings or the natural 
environment. 
(c) ?The prominence of a building in both an urban and natural setting. 
(d) ?The impact of a site with respect to the historical factors or development themes that 
contributed to the creation of neighborhoods and subdivisions. 
(B) ?The evaluation system for sites of architectural, historical and contextual significance was on a 
scale of 1 to 3. All sites were given a rating for each area of significancearchitecture, history, and 
context, respectivelyi.e. a site with a rating of 123 would have a 1 in architecture, a 2 in history and 
a 3 in context. A rating of 1 implies major significance, a rating of 2 means the site has secondary 
significance, but its preservation should still be considered and a rating of 3 indicates minor 
significance. 
(Approved 3-26-84) 


Sec. 153-56. - Archeological significance. 
(A) ?For properties of archeological significance the following criteria is used to determine the 
significance of an archeological site. 
(1) ?Important historical event or person associated with the site. 
(2) ?The quality of the site or the date recoverable from the site is of sufficient enough significance 
that it would provide unique information on prehistoric or historical events. 
(3) ?The site was the locus of discreet types of activities such as habitation, religious, burial, 
fortification, etc. 
(4) ?The site was the location of historic or prehistoric activities during a particular period of time. 
(5) ?The site maintains a sufficient degree of environmental integrity to reflect some aspect of the 
relationship of the site's original occupants to the environment. 
(B) ?Archeological sites identified in the survey are also rated for their preservation quality. 
(1) ?The site is intact and has had little or no subsurface disturbance. The site should be preserved 
or excavated if threatened with destruction or alteration. 
(2) ?The site is slightly to moderately disturbed, but what actually remains has considerable 
potential for providing useful information. The site should be preserved if possible and 
considered for excavation if threatened with destruction or alteration. 
(3) ?The site is severely disturbed, which may include destruction or disturbance to an area of the 
site. The quality and volume of existing data may still permit useful and representative data to 
be recovered. Preservation of the site should be considered and excavation may be appropriate 
to mitigate any adverse impact on the site. 
(4) ?The site is severely altered and the quality of the data is poor. Neither preservation or 
excavation is recommended. 
(5) ?The site has been completely destroyed. 
(6) ?The preservation quality of the site is unknown because the site is covered by a structure, 
roadway, or fill. 
(C) ?Archeological sites also receive a classification according to their site type. 
Prehistoric 
1) ?Constructed mounds 
2) ?Earthworks 
3) ?Trails 
4) ?Habitation sites 
5) ?Unclassified activity areas 
6) ?Cemeteries, human burials

39) ?Docks and landings 
40) ?Cisterns, wells, and quarries 
41) ?Garbage dumps 
42) ?Unclassified historic activity 
(D) ?All archeological sites are rated in a numerical sequence. The first number refers to the 
preservation quality of the site. Following the first number is a dash which is followed by a second 
number which refers to the type of archeological site. An example of an archeological rating is 2-21 
which would mean that the site is a coontie mill from between 18191860, and is slightly disturbed 
but has the potential for providing useful information. Preservation of the site should be encouraged 
and an archeological excavation should be attempted if the site is threatened.

additional information, samples of material, photographs, or reports that may support his case. 
(5) ?For all applications for a certificate of appropriateness classified as demolition, the applicant 
shall include a report (not more than 300 words) explaining why the designated property should 
be demolished as supplementary material. If the applicant is seeking demolition of the 
designated property for reasons of economic hardship, the applicant shall include as 
supplementary material all pertinent data pertaining to the cost of preservation, demolition, and 
new construction. The owner is encouraged to include any reports, economic analysis, 
structural surveys, plans, or photographs that may support his case. 
(6) ?For all certificates of appropriateness classified as new construction in a district the applicant 
shall supply a site plan, elevations, floor plan, and landscape plan as supplementary material. 
(7) ?For all applications for a certificate of appropriateness classified as relocation, the applicant 
shall include a report (not more than 300 words) justifying the relocation of the building. This 
report shall clearly indicate that efforts have been made to preserve the building in situ and that 
other alternative means of preservation would not be feasible. The report shall also include 
justification for the proposed relocation site, as well as photographs and a site plan. 
(D) ?Accuracy. Signature and statement attesting to the truthfulness and accuracy of the information 
supplied by the applicant. 
(Approved 3-26-84) 


Sec. 153-60. - Standards for evaluating certificates of appropriateness. 
(A) ?Certificates of appropriateness shall be classified according to the following categories. 
(1) ?Maintenance or repair. The act or process of applying measures to sustain the existing form, 
integrity, and material of a building or structure and the existing form and vegetative cover of a 
site. It may include initial stabilization work, where necessary, as well as on-going maintenance 
and repair of the property. 
(2) ?Restoration. The process of accurately recovering the form and details of a property and its 
setting as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of later work or by 
the replacement of missing earlier work. 
(3) ?Rehabilitation. The process of returning a property to a state of utility through repair or 
alteration which makes possible an efficient contemporary use while preserving those portions 
or features of the property which are significant to its historical, architectural, and cultural 
values. 
(4) ?Excavation. The process of performing an archeological dig to recover artifacts, historical 
material, or other archeological features. 
(5) ?Demolition. The process of destroying or tearing down a building or structure or the process of 
removing or destroying an archeological site. 
(6) ?New construction. The process of constructing a building or structure that has never before 
existed at that location. 
(7) ?Relocation. The process of moving a building or structure from its current foundation or location 
to another site. 
(B) ?The following are the recommended objectives for all preservation projects in Dade County. 
(1) ?Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires 
minimal alteration of the building structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its 
originally intended purpose. 
(2) ?The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its 
environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or 
distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
(3) ?All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations 
which have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be 
discouraged. 
(4) ?Changes which may have taken place in the course of time and evidence of the history and 
development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have 
acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(5) ?Distinctive stylistic features or examples or skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, 
structure, or site, shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(6) ?Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In 
the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced 
in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of 
missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, 
substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or 
the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(7) ?The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. 
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall 
not be undertaken. 
(8) ?Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected 
by, or adjacent to, any project. 
(Approved 3-26-84)

general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific area by 
the provisions designed to: 
(1) ?Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or 
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or 
velocities; 
(2) ?Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected 
against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3) ?Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers 
which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4) ?Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion of flood 
damage; and 
(5) ?Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters 
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(B) ?Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1) ?To protect human life and health; 
(2) ?To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3) ?To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4) ?To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5) ?To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, 
telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6) ?To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood 
prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight; and

    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basements). An unfinished or 
flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area 
other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is 
not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements. 
    Mean sea level. The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for 
establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous 
with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    National geodetic vertical datum (NGVD). As corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a 
reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction. Any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after June 18, 
1974. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structure. 
    Start of construction. (For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the 
Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the 
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or 
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of 
permanent construction of a building on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of 
piles, construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does 
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of 
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundation or 
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, 
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a substantial 
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other 
structural part of a building, whether or not alteration affects the eternal dimensions of the building. 
    Structure. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas 
or liquid storage tank or other man-made facilities or infrastructures. 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the 
structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the 
structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a 
building, taking place during (the life of a building), in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 
percent of the market value of the building. The market value of the building should be the appraised 
value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the 
value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred 
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, 
substantial improvement if considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other 
structural part of the building commences, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of 
the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to 
comply with the existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the 
code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
    Variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a 
manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary 
hardship.

building official for inclusion in the City's records. 
(B) ?Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, 
industrial or nonresidential building shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no 
lower than one foot above the established base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A-zones 
may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the 
required elevation are water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, 
and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic 
loads and the effect of buoyancy. A professional engineer or architect shall thereafter certify the 
"as built" elevations of all new or substantially improved nonresidential structures, including 
mean sea level elevation datum, which shall be submitted to the chief building official for 
inclusion in the City's records. 
(C) ?Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that 
include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood 
elevation shall be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically 
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.

(6) ?Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or 
substantially improved buildings have been flood-proofed, in accordance with the requirements 
of this chapter. 
(7) ?When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular building, the chief building official shall obtain 
certification from a registered professional engineer or architect in accordance with the 
requirements of this chapter. 
(8) ?Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special 
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary 
and actual field conditions) the chief building official shall make the necessary interpretation. 
The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to 
appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter. 
(9) ?When base flood election data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with the 
requirements of this chapter, then the chief building official shall obtain, review and reasonably 
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other

administration of this chapter. 
(C) ?Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment or any other person may appeal 
such decision to the City Board of Appeals and thereafter to the Dade County Circuit Court, by 
common law writ of certiorari, as provided in the Florida appellate rules. 
(D) ?Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (see § 154-02) upon a 
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued 
designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic 
character and design of the structure. 
(E) ?In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, 
all relevant factors and all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1) ?The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2) ?The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3) ?The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of 
such damage on the individual owner; 
(4) ?The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5) ?The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent 
facility; 
(6) ?The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the 
proposed use; 
(7) ?The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8) ?The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management 
program for that area; 
(9) ?The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

purposes of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of 
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(G) ?Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during 
the base flood discharge would result. 
(1) ?Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum 
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical 
building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the 
historic character and design of the building; 
(2) ?Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause; a determination 
that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and a determination that 
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public 
safety, extraordinary public expenses, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the 
public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3) ?Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the 
difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built 
and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk 
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4) ?The chief building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any 
variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request. 
(Ord. 800-92, passed 11-23-92)
