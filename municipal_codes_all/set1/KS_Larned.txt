LARNED MUNICIPAL CODE 1999 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Larned, Kansas 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 6, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
PREFACE 
The Larned, Kansas Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement 6, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 6, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 1603 , passed July 1, 2019.

(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.040 - Use of the right-of-way. 
A.  The right-of-way user's use of the right-of-way shall in all matters be subordinate to the City's use or occupation of the right-of-way. Without limitation of its rights, the City expressly reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers now and hereafter vested in or granted to the City. 
B.  The right-of-way user shall coordinate the placement of facilities in a manner which minimizes adverse impact on any public improvement, as reasonably determined by the City. Where placement is not regulated, the facilities shall be placed with adequate clearance from such public improvements so as not to impact or be impacted by such public improvement. 
C.  The right-of-way user shall consider any request made by the City concerning placement of facilities in private easements in order to limit or eliminate future street improvement relocation expenses. 
D.  All facilities shall be located and laid so as not to disrupt or interfere with any pipes, drains, sewers, irrigation systems, or other structures or public improvements already installed. In addition, the right-of-way user shall, in doing work in connection with its facilities, avoid, so far as may be practicable, disrupting or interfering with the lawful use of the streets, alleys, sidewalks or other public lands of the City. 
E.  All facilities of the right-of-way user shall be placed so that they do not interfere with the use of right-of-way and public lands. The City, through its Building Inspector, shall have the right to consult and review the location, design and nature of the facility prior to its being installed. 
F.  Whenever reasonably possible, all newly constructed facilities shall be located underground. The right-of-way user shall comply with all requirements of the City relating to underground facilities. This requirement may be waived by the Building Inspector at the Inspector's discretion for safety concerns, or some other good cause under the condition that does not cause discrimination among right-of-way users. If this requirement is waived, the facilities shall be located as directed by the Building Inspector, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding location and height. 
G.  The right-of-way user shall not interfere with the facilities of the other right-of-way users without their permission. If and when the City requires or negotiates to have a service provider cease using its existing poles and to relocate its facilities underground, all other service providers using the same poles shall also relocate their facilities underground at the same time, subject to the appeal process contained in Section 12.50.130 of this chapter, as amended. 
H.  The Building Inspector may assign specific corridors within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is currently or, pursuant to current technology, the Building Inspector expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All right-of-way permits issued by Building Inspector shall indicate the proper corridor for the right-of-way user's facilities. Any right-of-way user whose facilities are currently in the right-of-way in a position at a variance with the designated corridors shall not be requested to move its facilities in the right-of-way except for a public works project that may require those facilities to be moved, or except if the right-of-way user facilities have been laid above other utility lines such as water, sewer and electric and those other utility lines need to be replaced or repaired. 
I.  If, in the preparation and planning of a right-of-way project, the Building Inspector deems it appropriate for a conduit to be constructed along, across or under the right-of-way, the Building Inspector shall contact all appropriate right-of-way users for their input on the planning and design of such conduit. If a right-of-way user desires to construct, maintain or operate facilities along such right-of-way, the Building Inspector may require the right-of-way user to use such conduit, and to contribute to the expense of such conduit, provided, however, the right-of-way user's use of the conduit is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. 
J.  All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other public improvements or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the right-of-way user shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the right-of-way user at its sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City. Upon determination by the Building Inspector that such repair of replacement is a public safety matter, all such repair or replacement shall be commenced within twenty-four (24) hours of notice from the City, or the Building Inspector may direct the City to make such repair or replacement and bill the right-of-way user for the City cost. The Building Inspector has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage, and if necessary, to require the right-of-way user to do any necessary additional work. 
K.  All technical standards governing construction, reconstruction, installation, operation, testing use, maintenance and dismantling of a right-of-way user's facilities in the right-of-way shall be in accordance with applicable federal, state and local law and regulations, including those promulgated by national trade associations commonly associated with the service provided by the right-of-way user. It is understood that the standards established in this subsection are minimum standards and the requirements established or referenced in this chapter may be in addition to or stricter than such minimum standards. A right-of-way user shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or within the City right-of-way without first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to the Building Inspector and having received a permit for such improvement. The Building Inspector may require that any drawings, plans and/or specifications submitted be certified by a Kansas registered professional engineer stating that such drawings, plans and/or specifications comply with all applicable technical codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based directly on nationally recognized codes, which are appropriately cited, and attested to on the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the organization applying for the permit. 
L.  The right-of-way user shall cooperate promptly and fully with the City and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide accurate and complete on-site information regarding the nature and horizontal and vertical location of its facilities located within the right-of-way, both underground and overhead, when requested by the City or its authorized agent for a public improvement. Such location and identification shall be at the sole expense of the right-of-way user without any expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors.

12.50.050 - Facility relocation. 
A.  The right-of-way user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in the right-of-way as directed by the City for a public improvement or when reasonably required by the City by reason of public safety. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be performed by the right-of-way user at the right-of-way user's expense without expense to the City, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations and schedules of the City pertaining to such. The right-of-way user shall proceed with relocations at due diligence upon notice by the City to begin relocation. 
B.  The right-of-way user shall promptly remove, relocate or adjust any facilities located in a private easement, as directed by the City, for a public improvement, at City expense, by moving such facilities to areas within the expanded right-of-way or within remaining private easements or remaining portions of such easements not condemned by nor disclaimed to the City to avoid conflict with City construction and improvements. The right-of-way user shall disclaim those parts of its easements which lie within the expanded right-of-way. Should the City, in the future, elect to require the right-of-way user to again relocate its facilities to other areas within the expanded right-of-way, the cost of any such future relocation shall be borne by the City. 
C.  As soon as working drawings are available for public improvements which will require the right-of-way user to relocate its facilities, the City shall provide the right-of-way user with written notice of relocations and the anticipated bid letting date of said improvement. The right-of-way user shall respond with any conflicts and a proposed construction schedule within thirty (30) days. 
D.  Following notice by the City in the form of the delivery of final design plans for such public improvements, the right-of-way user shall remove, and relocate its facilities in accordance with the mutually agreed upon schedule, provided the project is not delayed by adverse weather conditions and other factors beyond the control of the right-of-way user. The right-of-way user shall certify to the City, in writing that its facilities have been relocated or adjusted to clear construction in accordance with project plans provided by the City. 
E.  Any damages suffered by the City, its agents or its contractors to the extent caused by right-of-way user's failure to timely relocate or adjust its facilities, or failure to properly relocate or adjust such facilities, shall be borne by the right-of-way user. 
F.  In the event the right-of-way user is required to move its facilities in accordance with this section, any ordinary right-of-way permit fee shall be waived. 
G.  It is the intent of this section for both the City and the right-of-way user to cooperate with one another so that the need for facility relocation is minimized and, when required and feasible, relocations may be completed prior to receipt of bids by the City for a public improvement. 
(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.060 - Protection of the public. 
A.  It shall be the responsibility of the right-of-way user to take adequate measures to protect and defend its facilities in the right-of-way from harm and damage.

C.  The right-of-way user shall be responsible to the City and its agents, representatives, authorized contractors for all damage suffered by them including, but not limited to, delay damages, repair costs, construction delays, penalties or other expenses of any kind arising out of the failure of the right-of-way user to timely perform any of its obligations under this chapter to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of the right-of-way user. 
D.  The City or its authorized contractors shall be responsible for taking reasonable precautionary measures including calling for facility locations. 
E.  Any right-of-way user who for any purpose makes or causes to be made any excavation in, upon, under, through or adjoining any street, sidewalk, alley or other right-of-way, and shall leave any part or portion thereof open, or shall leave any part or portion thereof disrupted with rubbish, building or other material during construction and/or the night time, shall cause the same to be enclosed with good substantial and sufficient barricades or drums equipped with the appropriate type warning lights and orange safety fencing material which is properly secured around the excavation or the disruption. 
F.  Whenever a right-of-way user shall excavate the full width of any street, sidewalk, alley, driveway approach or other right-of-way, it shall be its duty to maintain an adequate passage for vehicles and pedestrians across or around the excavation until it is refilled as specified. 
G.  Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector type street shall be securely covered. The right-of-way user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. 
H.  The Building Inspector, upon the review and approval of a plan and details for trimming trees in the right-of-way, may grant permission by permit to any right-of-way user to trim trees upon and overhanging the right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the facilities of the right-of-way user. 
I.  In the event the right-of-way user severely disturbs or damages the root structure of any tree in the right-of-way to the detriment of the health and safety of the tree, the right-of-way user will be required to remove and replace the tree at the right-of-way user's cost. Further, in review of the right-of-way user's plan, the Building Inspector may require the right-of-way user to directionally bore around any tree in the right-of-way. 
J.  Upon the appropriate request of any person having satisfied City procedure and ordinances, the right-of-way user shall remove, raise, or lower its facilities temporarily to permit the moving of houses or other structures. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the right-of-way user may require such payment in advance. The right-of-way user must be given not less than fifteen (15) days' written notice from the person detailing the time and location of the moving operations, and not less than twenty-four (24) hours advance notice from the person advising of the actual operation. 
K.  The City shall have the authority to prohibit the use or occupancy of a specific portion of the right-of-way by a right-of-way user due to public health, safety or welfare considerations. 
(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.070 - Right-of-way vacation. 
A.  If the City vacates a right-of-way which contains the facilities of the service provider, and if the vacation does not require the relocation of the service provider's facilities, the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all service providers having facilities in the vacated right-of-way, an easement for the right to install, maintain and operate any facilities in the vacated right-of-way, and to enter upon such vacated right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same. 
B.  If the vacation requires the relocation of facilities, and: 
l.  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the service provider, the service provider must pay the relocation costs; 
2.  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the City, the service provider must pay the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City and the service provider; 
3.  If the vacation proceedings are initiated by a person other than the service provider or the City, such other person must pay the relocation costs. 
(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.080 - Abandoned and unusable facilities. 
A.  A right-of-way user owning abandoned facilities in the right-of-way must either: 
1.  Remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense. The Building Inspector may allow underground facilities or portions thereof to remain in place if the Building Inspector determines that it is in the best interest of public safety to do so. At such time, the City may take ownership and responsibility of such vacated facilities left in place; 
2.  Provide information satisfactory to the City that the right-of-way user's obligations for its facilities in the right-of-way have been lawfully assumed by another authorized right-of-way user; or 
3.  Submit to the City a proposal and instruments for transferring ownership of its facilities to the City. If the right-of-way user proceeds under this section, the City may, at its option, purchase the equipment, require the right-of-way user, at its own expense, to remove it, or require the right-of-way user to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the City for reasonable anticipated costs to be incurred to remove the facilities. 
B.  Facilities of a right-of-way user who fails to comply with this section, and whose facilities remain unused for two years, shall be deemed to be abandoned after the City has made a good faith effort to contact the right-of-way user, unless the City receives confirmation that the right-of-way user intends to use the facilities. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a useable function, or (c) requiring the removal of the facility by the right-of-way user. 
(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.090 - Permit requirement. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided, no right-of-way user may excavate any right-of-way or conduct any repair, construction, or reconstruction of facilities located within the right-of-way without first having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit. 
B.  There are two exemptions to this provision: 
1.  Contractors working on the construction or reconstruction of public improvements; and 
2.  Right-of-way users performing routine service operations which do not require excavation in the right-of-way and do not disrupt traffic for more than four hours. 
C.  No person owning or occupying any land abutting on a public right-of-way shall construct, maintain, or permit in or on the portion of the public right-of-way to which such land is adjacent, any fixed structure, material or object without having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit. 
D.  A right-of-way permit is required for emergency situations. If due to an emergency it is necessary for the right-of-way user to immediately perform work in the right-of-way, and it is impractical for the right-of-way user to first get the appropriate permit, the work may be performed, and the required permit shall be obtained as soon as possible during the next City working day. 
E.  No permittee may excavate the right-of-way beyond the date or dates specified in the right-of-way permit unless the permittee: 
1.  Makes a supplementary application for another right-of-way permit before the expiration of the initial permit; and 
2.  A new right-of-way permit or permit extension is granted. 
F.  Right-of-way permits issued shall be conspicuously displayed by the permittee at all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by the Building Inspector, other City employees and the public. 
G.  Prior to the commencement of excavation, the permittee shall identify and locate any buried facilities to be spray painted according to the Uniform Color Code required by the Kansas One Call. 
H.  Before receiving a right-of-way permit, the applicant must show proof of any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, franchise ordinance or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the KCC. 
I.  Any right-of-way user who is found to be working in the public right-of-way without a permit will be directed to stop work until a permit is acquired and properly posted at the work site. The only exception allowed is for emergency repair work. 
J.  Any permittee found to be working without providing for required safety and traffic control will be directed to stop work until the appropriate measures are implemented in accordance with the current edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

The amount will be not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) in aggregate. The insurance will protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death, or property damage to the extent caused or alleged to have been caused by the negligent acts or omissions of the permittee. If the permittee is self-insured, it shall provide the City proof of compliance regarding its ability to self-insure and proof of its ability to provide coverage in the above amounts. 
B.  The permittee shall at all times during the term of the permit and for two years thereafter, maintain a performance and maintenance bond in a form approved by the City Attorney. The amount of the bond will be five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or the value of the restoration, whichever is greater, for a term consistent with the term of the permit plus two additional years, conditioned upon the permittee's faithful performance of the provisions, terms and conditions conferred by this chapter. An annual bond in an amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) automatically renewed yearly during this period shall satisfy the requirement of this section. In the event the City shall exercise its right to revoke the permit as granted herein, then the City shall be entitled to recover under the terms of said bond the full amount of any loss occasioned. 
C.  A copy of the liability insurance certificate and performance and maintenance bond must be on file with the City Clerk. 
D.  No performance and maintenance bond or liability insurance will be required of any governmental entity, or of any residential property owner working in the right-of-way adjacent to his or her residence, who does not utilize a contractor to perform the excavation.

(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.094 - Issuance of permit. 
A.  If the Building Inspector determines that the applicant has satisfied the requirements of this chapter, the Building Inspector shall issue a right-of-way permit. 
B.  The Building Inspector may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a right-of-way permit and performance of the permittee in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the right-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the right-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. 
C.  When a right-of-way permit is requested for purposes of installing additional facilities and the performance and maintenance bond for additional facilities is reasonably determined to be insufficient, the posting of an additional or larger performance and maintenance bond for the additional facilities may be required. 
D.  Issued permits are not transferable. 
E.  If work is being done for the right-of-way user by another person, a subcontractor or otherwise, the person doing the work and the right-of-way user shall be liable and responsible for all damages, obligations, and warranties herein described. 
(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.095 - Permitted work. 
A.  The permittee shall not make any cut, excavation or grading or right-of-way other than excavations necessary for emergency repairs without first securing a right-of-way permit.

E.  The permittee shall notify the City no less than two working days in advance of any construction, reconstruction, repair, location or relocation of facilities which would require any street closure or which reduces traffic flow to less than two lanes of moving traffic. Except in the event of an emergency as reasonably determined by the permittee, no such closure shall take place without notice and prior authorization from the City. 
F.  Nonemergency work on collector and arterial streets may not be performed during the hours of five p.m. to eight a.m. in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow. 
G.

The permittee shall not make or attempt to make repairs, relocation or replacement of damaged or disturbed underground facilities without the approval of the owner of the facilities. 
J.  Whenever there is an excavation by the permittee, the permittee shall be responsible for providing adequate traffic control to the surrounding area as determined by Building Inspector of the City. The permittee shall perform work on the right-of-way at such times that will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. In the event the excavation is not completed in a reasonable period of time, the permittee may be liable for actual damages to the City for delay caused by the permittee pursuant to this chapter. 
K.  All facilities and other appurtenances laid, constructed and maintained by the permittee shall be laid, constructed and maintained in accordance with acceptable engineering practice and in full accord with any and all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the parties and in accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Kansas, as well as the rules and regulations of the Kansas Corporation Commission or any other local, state or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. 
L.  Following completion of permitted work for new construction, the permittee shall keep, maintain and provide to the City accurate records and as-built drawings, drawn to scale and certified to the City as accurately depicting the location of all utility facilities constructed pursuant to the permit. When available to the permittee, maps and drawings provided, will be an AutoCAD format compatible with the City's existing information system. Such information shall be subject in all respects and shall have the benefit of protection as set forth in Section 12.50.032 of this chapter entitled "Mapping requirements of service provider." 
M.  The City may use the as-built records of the service provider's facilities in connection with public improvements. 
(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)

B.  All earth, materials, sidewalks, curbs, paving, crossing, utilities, public improvement, or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the permittee shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the permittee at its sole expense and the reasonable satisfaction of the City. The Building Inspector has the authority to inspect the repair or replacement of the damage and, if necessary, to require the permittee to do the additional necessary work. Notice of the unsatisfactory restoration and the deficiencies found will be provided to the permittee and a reasonable time not to exceed fifteen (15) days will be provided to allow for the deficiencies to be corrected. 
C.  After any excavation, the permittee shall, at its expense, restore all portions of the right-of-way to the same condition or better condition than it was prior to the excavation thereof. 
D.  In addition to repairing its own street cuts, the permittee will be responsible for restoring the area adjacent to any street cut to the point that repaired pavement attaches to existing solid pavement. The pavement material will be furnished by the City and billed to the permittee at the City's cost. 
E.  If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the Building Inspector and in accordance with the standards established by the City of Larned street department superintendent, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restoration, the City may, at its option, serve written notice upon the permittee and its surety that, unless within five days after serving of such notice, a satisfactory arrangement can be made for the proper restoration of the right-of-way, the City shall immediately serve notice of failure to comply upon the surety and the permittee, and the surety shall have the right to take over and complete the work, provided, however, that if the surety does not commence performance thereof within ten (10) days from the date of notice, the City may take over the work and prosecute same to completion, by contract or otherwise, at the expense of the permittee, and the permittee and its surety shall be liable to the City for any and all excess cost assumed by the City by reason of such prosecution and completion.

During the twenty-four (24) months, the permittee shall, upon notification from the Building Inspector, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using any method as required by the Building Inspector. Said work shall be completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, of the receipt of notice from the Building Inspector (not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable). In the event the permittee is required to perform such new restoration pursuant to the foregoing guarantee, the Building Inspector shall have the authority to extend the guarantee period for such new restoration for up to an additional twenty-four (24) months from the date of the new restoration, if the Building Inspector determines any overt action by the permittee not to comply with the conditions of the right-of-way permit and any restoration requirements. 
I.  The twenty-four (24) month guarantee period shall be applicable to failure of the pavement surface as well as failure below the pavement surface. 
J.  Payment of a degradation fee shall not relieve the permittee of the obligation to complete the necessary right-of-way restoration.

12.50.100 - Denial of permit. 
A.  The Building Inspector may deny a permit to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its users. The Building Inspector, at Inspector's discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors in denial of the permit: 
1.  The extent to which the right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; 
2.  The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way; 
3.  The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other right-of-way for the facilities of the applicant; 
4.  The applicability of any ordinance or other regulations that affect location of facilities in the right-of-way; 
5.  The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise ordinance, the ordinance codified in this chapter, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; 
6.  The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way; 
7.  The condition and age of the right-of-way which was constructed or reconstructed within the preceding five years; 
8.  The balancing of costs of disruption to the public and damage to the right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the construction in the right-of-way; 
9.  Whether the applicant maintains a current registration with the City; 
10.  Whether the applicant has failed within the last three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the requirements of this chapter; 
11.  Whether the applicant has delinquent debt owed to the City; or 
12.  Whether the issuance of a right-of-way permit for the particular dates and/or time requested would cause a conflict or interferes with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. In exercising this discretion, the Building Inspector shall be guided by the safety and convenience of anticipated travel of the public over the right-of-way. 
B.  Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Building Inspector may, in the Inspector's discretion, issue a right-of-way permit in any case where the permit is necessary to: 
1.  Prevent substantial economic hardship to a user of the applicant's service; or 
2.  Allow such user to materially improve the service provided by the applicant. 
(Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)

The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without refund of the permit fee, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or the right-of-way permit. A substantial breach shall include, but not limited to, the following:

8.  Failure to repair facilities damaged in the right-of-way. 
B.  If the Building Inspector determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of any law or condition placed on the right-of-way permit, the Building Inspector shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that the continued violation may be cause for revocation of the permit or legal action, if applicable. Further, a substantial breach as stated above, will allow the Building Inspector, at the Inspector's discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the right-of-way permit, specifically related to the manner in which the breach is cured by the permittee. Within five calendar days of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Building Inspector with a plan, acceptable to the Building Inspector, for correction of the breach. Permittee's failure to contact the Building Inspector, permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for immediate revocation of the right-of-way permit. 
C.  If a right-of-way permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City for the City's reasonable costs, including administrative costs, restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

Permittee shall pay all costs associated with any compaction testing. 
C.  The permittee shall notify the office of the Building Inspector upon completion of the authorized work permit. 
D.  The permittee will notify the Building Inspector to schedule an inspection at the start of backfilling. Upon completion of all right-of-way restoration activities, the permittee will schedule a closeout inspection. 
E.  When any corrective actions required have been completed and inspected to the Building Inspector's satisfaction, the two-year maintenance period will begin. 
F.  In addition to the required scheduled inspections, the Building Inspector may choose to inspect the ongoing permitted work in the right-of-way at any time to ensure that all requirements of the approved permit are being met by the permittee. 
G.  At the time of any inspection, the Building Inspector may order the immediate cessation of any work, which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public. The Building Inspector may issue a citation to the permittee for any work which does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions, code or terms of the permit. The citation shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. 
(Ord. 1413 § 3(part), 2005; Ord. 1406 § 1(part), 2004)  
12.50.130 - Appeals process.

The City Manager shall give due consideration to the purposes of the rules in preserving public safety and convenience, integrity of public infrastructure, and the operational safety and function of the public right-of-way. 
E.  Pending a decision of the City Manager, the order of the Building Inspector shall be stayed, unless the Building Inspector determines that such action will pose a threat to public safety or the integrity of the public infrastructure. 
F.  If a person deems themselves aggrieved after the appeal to the City Manager, such person shall have thirty (30) days after the effective date of the City Manager's final decision to request a hearing before the Larned City Council. 
G.  If a person still deems themselves aggrieved after the appeal to the City Council, such person shall have thirty (30) days after the City Council's final decision to appeal such decision to the District Court of Pawnee County, Kansas.

12.50.140 - Indemnification. 
A right-of-way user operating under the provisions of this chapter shall fully indemnify, release, defend and hold harmless the City and agents of the City when acting in their capacity as municipal officials, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, and actions, liability and judgment by other persons for damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including attorney fees, to the extent caused by negligent acts or omissions of the right-of-way user in the performance of the permitted work. The City agrees to timely notify the right-of-way user of such claim, demand, suit, proceeding, and/or action by providing written notice to the right-of-way user and the registered agent of the right-of-way user. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the City or any agent from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at their own expense. Such participation shall not under any circumstances relieve the right-of-way user from its duty to defend against liability or its duty to pay any judgment entered against the City or its agents.

A.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for a progressive water supply conservation program, including the declaration of a water supply watch, warning or emergency and the implementation of voluntary and mandatory water conservation measures throughout the city in the event such a watch, warning or emergency is declared by the governing body of the City. 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  "Water," as used in this section, shall mean water available to the City of Larned for treatment by virtue of the City's water rights, water supply, water supply contracts or any treated water introduced by the City into its water distribution system, including water offered for sale at any coin-operated site. 
2.  "Customer," as used in this section, shall mean the customer of record using water for any purpose from the City's water distribution system and for which either a regular charge is made or, in the case of coin sales, a cash charge is made at the site of delivery. 
3.  "Waste of water," as used in this section, includes, but is not limited to: 
a.  Permitting water to escape down a, street, roadway or other surface intended for vehicle driving purposes, and/or any gutter, ditch, or other surface drain; or 
b.  Failure to repair a controllable leak of water due to defective plumbing. 
4.  The following classes of uses of water are established for the purposes of this ordinance: 
Class 1: Water used for outdoor watering; either public or private, for gardens, lawns, trees, shrubs, plants, parks, golf courses, playing fields, swimming pools or other recreational areas; or the washing of motor vehicles, boats, trailers, or the exterior of any building or structure. 
Class 2: Water used for any commercial, agricultural or industrial purposes, except water actually necessary to maintain the health and personal hygiene of bona fide employees of such businesses or interests while such employees are engaged in the performance of their duties at their place of employment. 
Class 3: Domestic usage, other than that which would be included in either Classes 1 or 2. 
Class 4: Water necessary only to sustain human life and the lives of domestic livestock pets and maintain standards of hygiene and sanitation. 
C.  In the event that the governing body of the City or the City's designated official determines that the City's water supply may be in subject to a shortage in supply or the governing body of the City determines there is need for conservation of City's water resources for any reason, the City may begin the progressive three stage water conservation program by declaring a water watch as described in subsection (C)(1) or, in times of need and/or duress, the governing body of the City may choose to declare any section of the program described in this subsection in effect at any time: 
1.  Stage 1: Declaration of Water Watch. Whenever the governing body of the City finds that conditions indicate that the probability of a drought or some other condition causing a major water supply shortage is rising, it shall be empowered to declare, by resolution, that a water watch exists and that it shall take steps to inform the public and ask for voluntary reductions in water use. Such a watch shall be deemed to continue until it is declared by resolution of the governing body to have ended. The resolutions declaring the existence and end of a water watch shall be effective upon their publication in the official city newspaper. 
2.  Stage 2: Declaration of Water Warning. Whenever the governing body of the City finds that drought conditions or some other condition causing a major water supply shortage are present and supplies are starting to decline, it shall be empowered to declare by resolution that a water warning exists and that it will recommend restrictions on nonessential uses during the period of warning. Such a warning shall be deemed to continue until it is declared by resolution of the governing body to have ended. The resolutions declaring the beginning and ending of the water warning shall be effective upon their publication in the official city newspaper. Pursuant to the approval of the Chief Engineer, Division of Water Resources, Kansas Department of Agriculture, the recommended restrictions on nonessential uses may be extended to private wells within the City limits. 
3.  Stage 3: Declaration of Water Emergency. Whenever the governing body of the City finds that an emergency exists by reason of a shortage of water supply needed for essential uses, it shall be empowered to declare by resolution that a water supply emergency exists and that it will impose mandatory restrictions on water use during the period of the emergency. Such an emergency shall be deemed to continue until it is declared by resolution of the governing body to have ended.

10.  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amendable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
11.  Any waters or wastes having (1) a five-day BOD greater than three hundred (300) parts per million by weight, or (2) containing more than three hundred fifty (350) parts per million by weight of suspended solids, or (3) having an average daily flow greater than two percent of the average sewage flow of the City, shall be subject to the review of the Inspector. Where necessary in the opinion of the Inspector the owner shall provide, at his or her expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to (1) reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to three hundred (300) parts per million by weight, or (2) reduce the suspended solids to three hundred fifty (350) parts per million by weight, or (3) control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the Inspector and no construction or such facilities shall be commenced until such approvals are obtained in writing. 
E.  If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection D of this section, and which in the judgment of the Inspector may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life to constitute a public nuisance, the Inspector may: 
1.  Reject the wastes; 
2.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;

H.  When required by the Inspector, the owner of any property services by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Inspector. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
I.  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazard to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. 
J.  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern.

Upon resumption of service the depleted security deposit shall be restored in accordance with subsection A of this section, and every customer reconnected or resuming service after a deposit has been applied to payment of accrued bills or otherwise refunded, shall make a deposit as in the case of an original application. 
D.  Consumer Deposit Refund After One Year of Prompt Payment. The deposit required in subsection A of this section, together with accrued interest as required by law, shall be refunded upon surrender of the original receipt, if the customer has paid his or her bill by the fifteenth of each month continually for a period of one year.

13.20.230 - Extension policy. 
A.  Extension of Lines Outside the City Limits. 
1.  Free Extensions. The City shall make free extensions of its electric overhead distribution system as and when necessary to serve prospective domestic and business customers applying for such service, located outside the City limits in areas in which City is certificated by the Kansas Corporation Commission to provide service; however, City shall not be required to make any extension of its line to reach and serve prospective domestic and business customers who shall be located more than one-half mile from existing pole or wire lines, unless customer or customers applying for such service will, at the City's request: 
a.  Contribute an amount equal to the excess cost of such extension over the cost of a standard one-half mile extension for each customer served; or 
b.  Agree to an adjustment in the minimum monthly bill of City's rural rate schedules of four dollars ($4.00) for each one-fourth mile or less of line extension in excess of one-half mile. 
2.  Extraordinary Extensions. If, in the judgment of City, any extension requires such extraordinary construction costs, or the prospective service usage therefrom is so limited that it is doubtful whether the revenues from the extension will pay a fair return on the investment, City reserves the right to: 
a.  Require customer contribution sufficient to compensate City for the extraordinary expense involved; 
b.  A satisfactory guarantee of revenue through adjustment of the minimum bill provisions of the applicable rate; or 
c.  Where special equipment and/or facilities are required, collect a monthly rental charge based upon the cost of owning and maintaining such equipment and/or facilities. 
3.  Extensions of Special Characteristics. Applications for service requiring more than ten (10) KVA of transformer capacity, extensions of three phase service, or line extensions requiring more than fifteen thousand (15,000) volts are reserved for special consideration by City. In such cases City may require customer contribution or adjustment of the minimum bill provision of the applicable rate. Any unresolved questions respecting such adjustments or contributions shall be determined by the City Council. 
4.  Determination of Free Limit. The distance of customer's premises from the nearest existing electric distribution line having sufficient available capacity to provide adequate service to customer and to other customers thereto connected shall be measured along easements, streets, roads, highways, and alleys but not across private property. This distance, excluding the length of the overhead electric service line necessary to reach customer's premises from the extension of the distribution system shall be used to determine the cost of increasing and/or extending the nearest electric distribution line and shall be used as a basis for determining the amount of the contribution, or the minimum bill adjustment necessary if the extension exceeds the free limit. 
5.  Contribution by Customer. If a contribution from customer is required for a line extension exceeding the free limit, City will require that such contribution be paid before construction is started; however, City may, at its option, allow customer to pay such contribution in equal monthly installments over a period specified by City. If customer or City terminates service, the remaining unpaid contribution balance shall become immediately due and payable. Failure of customer to pay the monthly installments shall be cause for discontinuing service by City. The amount of the contribution required will be estimated by City. If, within a period of five years from the date of installation of such an extension, additional permanent customers are connected to the extension, City shall refund without interest to the original customer or customers an amount equal to the average estimated cost of a free extension as herein defined for each added customer. Refunds shall only be made for permanent customers whose premises are adjacent to and served directly from the original line extension. The total refund shall not exceed the original contribution. 
6.  Extensions of Underground Distribution System. City may make underground electric distribution system extensions at City's option. Customer or customers will contribute to City upon request, an amount equal to the estimated cost differential between the cost of the proposed underground distribution system and the cost of a conventional overhead distribution system. Such underground distribution system extensions are subject to City's general terms and conditions governing service and extensions as herein stated. 
7.  Customer's Guarantee. City shall not be obligated to make any extension of its electric distribution system unless customer shall execute a contract in writing with suitable guarantee that customer will use the service for at least five years, or unless the owner of the property served by such extension or some other responsible person shall guarantee that the service will be used for at least five years. 
8.  Right-of-Way Limitation. City shall not in any case be required to secure private rights-of-way for the purpose of making extensions of electric distribution lines or other facilities to property owned or otherwise controlled by customer. Customer will provide or procure for City such private rights-of-way as are satisfactory to City for the construction, operation, and maintenance by City of its facilities necessary or incidental to the supplying of electric service. 
9.  Extensions to be Property of City. All extensions made under these rules shall at all times be and remain the property of City.

PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a publication of the subdivision and zoning ordinances of the City of Larned, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the republication were the city's zoning and subdivision ordinances, as updated through October 25, 2010. The source of each new section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this republication, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as updated. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this publication is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a period. The figure before the period refers to the article number, and the figure after the period refers to the position of the section within the article. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents either the subdivision or zoning portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. The following are typical parts of publications, which may or may not appear in this publication at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE S:1 ZONING ORDINANCE Z:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 INDEX i:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Don Gaeddert, City Manager and Pam Corby, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a publication of the subdivision and zoning ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(300-320), 10-4-1982) 
ARTICLE 4. - MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 410. - Blocks. 
411.  Length. Intersecting streets (which determine block length) shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet existing streets in the neighborhood. In residential districts, where no existing plats are recorded, the blocks shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length, except that a greater length may be permitted where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block. Such pedestrian ways or easements shall have a minimum width of ten feet. 
412.  Width. In residential development, the block width shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. In certain instances, however, a different arrangement may be required in order to provide better circulation or to protect a major circulation route. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width and depth as may be considered most suitable for the prospective use. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(410-412), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 420. - Streets and alleys. 
421.  Relationship to adjoining street systems. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary for public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall be not less than the minimum street widths established herein. Alleys, when required, and street arrangement must cause no hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be platted and dedicated as public way. 
422.  Street names. Streets that are obviously in alignment with other already existing and named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. Street names should not be similar to already platted street names. East-west streets shall be numbered in accordance with the existing pattern. 
423.  Arterial streets. Arterial streets through subdivisions shall conform to the major street plan of the comprehensive plan as adopted by the planning commission and the governing body. 
424.  Local streets. Local streets should be designed so as to discourage through or non-local traffic. Local streets should not intersect arterial streets. 
425.  Cul-de-sacs. An adequate turnaround of not less than a 100-foot diameter right-of-way shall be provided at the closed end of a dead-end local street longer than one lot in length. Such local street segment shall not exceed 600 feet in length from the centerline of an intersection of a cross street to the center of the cul-de-sac. 
426.  Right-angle intersections. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out to intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other conditions justify a variation from the right-angle intersection, the minimum angle shall be 60 degrees. 
427.  Streets adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, limited access freeway, principal highway or arterial street. Where lots front or side, but do not back on railroad rights-of-way, limited access freeways, or principal highways or arterial streets, a marginal access street or frontage road may be required parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such rights-of-way. The distance from said rights-of-way shall be determined, with due consideration to minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade-separated intersections. 
428.  Half-streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where no lots front on such half-street. 
429.  Alleys. Alleys may be required in commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, wherever possible; but if unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead-end. Alleys should be avoided in residential areas except where alleys of adjoining subdivisions would be closed or shut-off by failing to provide alleys in the adjoining subdivision. 
430.  Minimum requirements. The right-of-way grades and widths for streets and alleys, dedicated and accepted, shall conform to the designation in the comprehensive plan and shall not be less than the minimum for each classification as follows: 
Minimum Right-of-Way Width Grade Major streets: Arterials 100 feet 5% Collectors 80 feet 8% Local streets: Residential 60 feet 10% Industrial and commercial 80 feet 6% Cul-de-sacs 100 feet diameter Marginal access streets or frontage roads: Two-way 50 feet 10% One-way 50 feet 10% Alleys 20 feet 10% Pedestrian ways 10 feet  
When existing or anticipated traffic on arterial and collector streets warrants greater widths of rights-of-way, the additional width shall be dedicated. The absolute minimum gradient on a street shall be 0.25 percent and a minimum gradient-shall be 1.0 percent wherever practical. 
431.  Street alignment. Minimum horizontal and vertical alignment on all streets, except in unusual cases, shall be as follows: 
a.  Minimum horizontal-radii at the centerline: 
Arterial streets\510 feet 
Collector streets\380 feet 
Local streets\200 feet 
b.  Minimum sight distance on vertical curves: 
Arterial streets\350 feet 
Collector streets\300 feet 
Local streets\200 feet 
432.  Street alignment. On streets with reverse curves, a reasonable tangent shall be provided between curves to permit a smooth flow of traffic. 
433.  Street layout. Proposed streets shall conform to topography as nearly as possible to reduce drainage problems and grades. 
434.  Curb radius. Where two local streets intersect, the curb at each block corner shall be rounded with a radius of at least 15 feet. At any intersection including one or more collector or arterial streets, the minimum curb radius shall be 25 feet. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(420-434), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 440. - Lots. 
441.  Minimum lot width shall be measured at the building setback line; however, in no case shall the lot width be less than 25 feet at the front property line. In addition, corner lots should have a width 15 feet greater than the minimum width. 
442.  Minimum lot depth shall be 100 feet. (Said measurement shall be made through the center of the lot and shall be perpendicular to the property line or radial to the property line on curved streets.) 
443.  The maximum depth of residential lots shall not exceed 21/2 times the width thereof, except where the lots are intended for single-family attached dwellings in which case the depth shall not exceed four times the width. 
444.  Minimum lot area shall be subject to the zoning regulations of the district in which the subdivision is located and the minimum design standards of this regulation. The more restrictive of the regulations shall govern. 
445.  All side lot lines shall bear between 60 and 90 degrees from the street right-of-way line on a straight street or from the tangent of a curved street. 
446.  Front building or setback lines shall be shown on the final plat for all lots in the subdivision and shall not be less than the setbacks required by the zoning regulations or any other regulations adopted by the governing body; the most restrictive setback requirement shall govern. 
447.  Double frontage lots shall be avoided unless, in the opinion of the governing body, a variation to this rule will give better street alignment and lot-arrangement. 
448.  Every lot shall abut on a public street other than an alley. 
449.  The subdivision or resubdivision of a tract shall not be permitted where said subdivision or resubdivision places an existing permanent structure in violation of the requirements of the zoning regulations or the minimum design standards of these regulations. 
450.  Where possible, residential lots shall not face on arterial streets. The number of lots facing on collector streets shall be kept to a minimum in each subdivision. The street pattern shall be designed so that the side lines of lots abut collector streets wherever land shapes and topography permit. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(440-450), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 460. - Easements. 
461.  Permanent easements. Where alleys are not provided, permanent easements of not less than 71/2 feet in width shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines, and three feet on side lot lines, where necessary, for utility poles, wires, conduits, underground conductors, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains, and other public utilities. Where the utility company or agency has the need for a wider easement than required above for a specific location, this easement shall be shown on the plat. Permanent easements shall not be obstructed by structures, retaining walls or trees. A property owner may install fences and landscape the easement with grass and shrubs at their own risk. A 12-foot temporary construction easement shall be provided on each side of all lot lines for initial construction of water, sewer and other utility lines. 
462.  Drainage easements. If a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainageway or channel, then a storm water easement shall be provided. Such easement or right-of-way shall conform substantially to the lines of such water course and shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary to provide adequate storm water drainage and for access for maintenance thereof. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. The subdivider shall have an engineer's study prepared for the planning commission as to the required width of such easement for each major water course or drainageway involved. Such study shall be based on a 100-year storm. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(460-462), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 470. - Subdivision design. 
471.  Access control. In the interest of public safety and for the preservation of the traffic-carrying capacity of the street system, the planning commission shall have the right to restrict and regulate points of access to all property from the public street system. Such restrictions shall be indicated on the final plat. 
472.  Subdivision design. The design of the subdivision shall provide for efficient traffic flow, proper mixing of land uses, and a logical link between surrounding, existing development, and the proposed layout. The comprehensive plan should be used as a guide in determining if the design of the proposed subdivision is proper. The planning commission shall have the authority to deny a plat or request redesign, if, in its opinion, the layout is not suitable for the site, or if the development of the subdivision would be premature. 
473.  Storm water runoff plan. The subdivider may be required to have an engineer's study prepared on the amount of increased storm water runoff which will be created by proposed development and a plan of how this runoff will be accommodated. The city may require design modification of the proposed storm water system to reduce increased runoff. 
474.  Design techniques. The following illustrations are examples which may be used in the review of the subdivision applications: 



(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(470-474), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 480. - Solar access. 
481.  In order to promote the conservation of energy through the use of both passive and active solar systems, streets in residential subdivisions should, where possible, have an east-west alignment. Lots intended for detached dwellings should be of sufficient width to allow the structure to be built with its longest axis running east-west. 
482.  In order to allow the orientation of structures on the site so as to maximize potential solar gain, side lot lines should run as near to north-south as possible providing that the angle between the side lot line and the street right-of-way line on a straight street or the tangent to a curved street shall be 60 to 90 degrees. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(480-482), 10-4-1982) 
ARTICLE 5. - DEDICATION OR RESERVATION OF PUBLIC OPEN SPACE 

Sec. 510. - Dedication or reservation of public sites and open spaces. 
    In subdividing land or resubdividing an existing plat, the planning commission shall dedicate and reserve for public sites and open spaces for parks, playgrounds, or other public recreational areas a minimum of ten percent of the total tract being subdivided. Any areas so dedicated or reserved shall conform as nearly as possible to the recommendations of the comprehensive plan. All areas to be reserved for, or dedicated to, public use shall be indicated on the preliminary plat in order that it may be determined when and in what manner such areas will be dedicated to or acquired by the appropriate agency. 
511.  Action by governing body. Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission, the governing body may: 
a.  Accept such dedication. 
b.  Accept, in lieu of the dedication of land, a fee equal to seven percent of the fair market value of the subdivided land. 
c.  Waive the requirement if the governing body finds that there are sufficient park facilities in the area of the subdivision. 
512.  Obligation of land or fees. All land or fees obtained through this provision shall only be used for recreation land or facilities for public use. All fees must be used for land or facilities within one-half mile of the subdivision which paid the fee. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(510-512), 10-4-1982; Ord. No. 1519, § 8, 10-25-2010) 
ARTICLE 6. - LOT SPLITS 

Sec. 610. - General. 
    The intent of this section is to provide for the issuance of building permits in lots divided into not more than two tracts without having to replat said lot, provided that the resulting lots shall not again be divided without replatting. The planning commission may approve or disapprove lot splits in accordance with the following regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(610), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 620. - Application procedure. 
    Requests for lot split approval shall be made by the owner of the land to the city clerk. Four copies of a scale drawing of the lots involved if there are not structures thereon, or, if structures are located on any part of the lot being split, four copies of a survey of the lot(s) and the location of the structure(s) thereon together with the precise nature, location and dimensions of the proposed lot split shall accompany the application. The application shall be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of all persons who own property within 200 feet of the property proposed to be split. Written notices shall be given to all such owners. Such owners shall have ten days from the date of notification to notify the city clerk of any protests they may have concerning the lot split. The ten-day waiting period may be waived upon submission in writing of statements from those to be notified that they have no objection to the proposed lot split. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(620), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 630. - Approval guidelines. 
    Approval or disapproval of lot splits shall be made, based on the following guidelines: 
1.  No lot split shall be approved if: 
a.  A new street or alley is needed or proposed. 
b.  A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required or proposed. 
c.  If such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, (e.g., utilities, schools, traffic control, streets, etc.); or will interfere with maintaining existing service levels (e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.). 
d.  There is less street right-of-way than required by these regulations or the comprehensive plan unless such dedication can be made by separate instrument. 
e.  All easement requirements have not been satisfied. 
f.  If such split will result in a tract without direct access to a street. 
g.  A substandard-sized lot or parcel will be created. 
h.  If the lot has been previously split in accordance with these regulations. 
2.  The planning commission may make such additional recommendations as deemed necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of existing land development regulations and governing body policy. Requirements may include, but not be limited to, installation of public facilities, dedication of rights-of-way and easements, and submission of covenants for the protection of other landowners in the original subdivision. 
3.  The planning commission shall, in writing, either approve, with or without conditions, or disapprove, the lot split within 30 days of application. If approved by the planning commission, and after all conditions have been met, the planning commission shall sign and furnish a certificate of approval to be affixed to the lot split survey and a certified copy thereof shall be filed with the register of deeds, the official designated to issue building or occupancy permits, and a copy shall be furnished to the applicant.

ARTICLE 8. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 8.10. - General. 
    Nonconformities are of three types: nonconforming lots of record, nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses. A definition of each type is as follows: 
8.11.  Nonconforming lot of record. An unimproved lot which is part of a recorded subdivision or a parcel of land, the deed to which was recorded prior to the adoption of these regulations and neither said lot nor parcel complies with the lot width or area requirements for any permitted use in the district in which it is located. 
8.12.  Nonconforming structure. An existing structure which does not comply with the height or yard requirements which are applicable to new structures in the zoning district in which it is located. 
8.13.  Nonconforming use. An existing use of a structure or of land which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is located. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(8.10-8.13), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 8.20. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    The zoning administrator shall issue a building permit for any nonconforming lot of record provided that: 
8.21.  Said lot is shown by recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations, and 
8.22.  Said lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations, and 
8.23.  Said lot can meet all yard regulations for the districts in which it is located, and 
8.24.  Said lot can meet minimum standards for sewage treatment as required by the county health office.

8.31.  Authority to continue. Any structure which is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable yard and height regulations, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful. 
8.32.  Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any nonconforming structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, remodeled, or replaced: Provided, however, that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or remodeling, or replacement shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure. Provided, further, that in no event shall the provisions hereof be considered to permit the continuance of or prevent the removal of any structure or encroachment when the governing body of the city determines such removal becomes necessary for the protection of the health and welfare of the citizens of said city pursuant to the police powers granted to the city by the Constitution of the United States and the State of Kansas. 
8.33.  Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. When a structure is damaged to the extent of 50 percent or less, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. 
8.34.  Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(8.30-8.34), 10-4-1982; Ord. No. 1330, § 7, 3-1-1999)

2.  Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition. 
8.43.  Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activities shall include, without being limited to:

8.44.  Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
8.45.  Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When such damage or destruction is 50 percent or less, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained, and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion. 
8.46.  Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and no nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof or the use of land shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved. 
8.47.  Change in use. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the board of zoning appeals either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board of zoning appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with section 9.23. Once a change is made to a more appropriate use, the use shall not be returned to the original use or a less appropriate use. 
8.48.  Abandonment or discontinuance. When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located. 
8.49.  Nonconforming accessory uses. No use which in accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or terminate. 
8.50.  Nonconforming residential uses. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.43 and 8.44, any structure which is devoted to a residential use and which is located in a business or industrial district, may be remodeled, extended, expanded, and enlarged; provided that after any such remodeling, expansion or enlargement, such structure shall not be used to accommodate a greater number of dwelling or lodging units than such structure accommodated prior to any such work. 
8.51.  Open storage in residential districts. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8.41, no use prohibited by section 5.110 shall be continued in any residential district for more than six months past the effective date of this ordinance.

Sec. 8.60. - Status of conditional uses. 
8.61.  Status of existing conditional uses. Where a use exists at the effective date of these regulations and is permitted by these regulations only as a conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall not be deemed to be a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a lawful conforming use in such zoning district. Such conditional use shall not be enlarged or expanded unless a conditional use application is approved as set out in article 9 of these regulations. 
8.62.  Status of future conditional uses. Any use for which a conditional use permit has been issued, as provided in these regulations, shall not be deemed to be a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a lawful conforming use.

Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the description of evidence presented, the findings of fact by the board, the decisions of the board, and the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be filed in the office of the city clerk immediately and shall be public record. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(9.10), 10-4-1982)

In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board, or by a court of record on application or notice to the zoning administrator on good cause shown. 
9.22.  Variances. To authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms of these regulations which will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, provided the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.

The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams or bridge openings restricted by debris. The article does not imply that areas outside the Floodway (FW) and Floodway Fringe (FF) district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Larned, Kansas, or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

13.42.  All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-year flood; however, the water surface elevation was not provided. The unnumbered A zones shall be subject to all development provisions of this ordinance. If flood insurance study data is not available, the community shall utilize any base flood elevation data from federal, state or other sources. 
13.43.  New construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated buildings, placement of manufactured homes and other development shall require. 
1.  Design or anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
2.  New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination. 
3.  Construction with materials resistant to flood damage, utilizing methods and practices that minimize flood damage, and with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service qualifies that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
4.  All utility and sanitary facilities be elevated or floodproofed up to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
5.  That until a floodway has been designated, no development, including landfill, may be permitted within zones A1-30 on the city's FIRM unless the applicant for the land use has demonstrated that the proposed use, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated uses, will not increase the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood more than one foot on the average cross section of the reach in which the development or landfill is located as shown on the flood insurance rate study. 
6.  Storage of material and equipment: 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. 
b.  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
7.  Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development be required to assure that 
a.  All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
b.  All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; 
c.  Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
d.  Proposals for development of five acres or 50 lots, whichever is lesser, include within such proposals the regulatory flood elevation.

1.  Require new construction, substantial improvements, or residential structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to not less than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
2.  Require new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to be floodproofed so that below such a level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 13.32.7. 
3.  Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
4.  Within AH zones adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
5.  Manufactured homes. 
a.  All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Manufactured homes must be anchored in accordance with local building codes or FEMA guidelines.

b.  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of section 13.56, 5.A. 
6.  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in this article are areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply within AO zones: 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
(1)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
(2)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above the level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 13.32.7. 
c.  Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(13.50-13.56), 10-4-1982; Ord. No. 1330, § 11, 3-1-1999) 
Sec. 13.60. - Floodway ("FW") overlay district. 
13.61.  Permitted use. Only uses having a low flood-damage potential and not obstructing flood flows shall be permitted within the Floodway "FW" District to the extent that they are not prohibited by the underlying district. All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that the encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. No use shall increase the flood levels of the regulatory flood elevation. The uses listed below are permitted subject to the use limitations of section 13.65 and the requirements of the underlying district. 
1.  Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries, and forestry. 
2.  Open space uses accessory to residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and play areas. 
3.  Open space uses accessory to non-residential uses such as loading areas, parking and airport landing strips.

Sec. 13.70. - Variance. 
13.71.  A variance to the strict application of any provision of this article may be granted by the board of zoning appeals subject to the provisions of article 9, provided that such a variance may only be granted if: 
1.  The structure is to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size and such lot is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
2.  The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places to be restored or reconstructed. 
13.72.  Variances shall not be issued except upon 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
3.  A determination that the variance issued will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing or state laws or ordinances. 
13.73.  Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the applicant requesting a variance shall meet the minimum necessary standards of this ordinance to afford relief. 
13.74.  The city will notify the applicant that the issuance of a variance to locate a structure at an elevation below the 100-year flood level will result in increased rates for flood insurance coverage. The applicant will provide written and notarized acknowledgement of such notification. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(13.70-13.74), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 13.80. - Nonconforming uses. 
    Any structure or any use of a structure or land which was lawfully in existence before the effective date of this ordinance but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance may be continued subject to the provisions of article 8. 
(Ord. No. 1088, exh. A(13.80), 10-4-1982) 
Sec. 13.90. - Definitions. 
    In addition to the words and phrases defined in article 12, the words and phrases listed below shall be interpreted as follows, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
1.  Actuarial or risk premium rates mean those rates established by the administrator pursuant to individual community studies and investigations which are undertaken to provide flood insurance in accordance with section 1307 of the Act and the accepted actuarial principles. "Risk premium rates" include provisions for operating costs and allowances. 
2.  Appeal means a request for a review of the zoning administrator's interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance. 
3.  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual change of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
4.  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the 100-year floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
5.  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year, and being a flood that is projected to occur once each 100 years. 
6.  Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
7.  Existing construction means (for the purposes of determining rates) structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
8.  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
9.  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of the community, on which the flood insurance study has delineated the flood hazard boundaries and the zones establishing insurance rates applicable to the community. 
10.  Floodway insurance study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
11.  Floodway or regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
12.  Floodway fringe is that area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway, that on the average is likely to be flooded once every 100 years (i.e., that has a one percent chance of flood occurrence in any one year). 
13.  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
14.  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
15.  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the terms "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes of the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
16.  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
17.  New construction means for which the start of construction or substantial improvement is commenced on or after the effective date of the FIRM. 
18.  Overlay district is a district in which additional requirements act in conjunction with the underlying zoning district(s). The original zoning district designation does not change. 
19.  Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, other than a mobile home, on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the state of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erections of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement or poured footings, the start of construction includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or, any part thereof, on its piling or foundation. For mobile homes not within a mobile home park or a mobile home subdivision, start of construction means the affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile homes within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions, start of construction is the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, construction of streets, final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of utilities) is completed. For insurance rating purposes the terms "pre-FIRM" and "post-FIRM" may be used. 
20.  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
21.  Substantial improvements means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either 
a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
22.  Variance is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in manners otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
