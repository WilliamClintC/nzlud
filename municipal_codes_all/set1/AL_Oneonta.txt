PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the ordinances of Oneonta, Alabama, of a general and permanent nature. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Chapter numbers have been reserved for subject areas in which it is reasonable to anticipate ordinances. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together have been included. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table reappearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two (2) component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the twelfth section of chapter 14 is 14-12. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-3 and 3-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-3.1, 3-3.2 and 3-3.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 3 and 4 it will be designated as chapter 3.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. A few "empty" chapters have been placed in the proper position for anticipated growth. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

When subsequent ordinances repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or omitted in the case of repeal, are prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code by the governing body.

A supplement to the Code should include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete. The new pages should be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections __________ to __________," inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code. 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-11. - Same-Exclusion of special or temporary ordinances. 
    Ordinances hereafter adopted which are not of a general or permanent nature shall not be prepared for insertion in this Code nor be deemed a part hereof.

Whenever possible, any complaint received from a member of the public which serves as the evidentiary basis for the animal control officer or law enforcement officer to find probable cause shall be sworn to and verified by the complainant and shall be attached to the petition. The municipal judge shall make such determination after a hearing, written notice of which shall be given to the complainant and to the owner of the animal, where the owner's address can be reasonably ascertained by the municipal court. The owner or keeper of the animal shall be served with notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition, either personally or by first-class mail with return receipt requested. The hearing shall be held no less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty (20) days after such notice is mailed to the owner or keeper of the animal and shall be open to the public. At such hearing all interested persons shall have the opportunity to present evidence on the issue of the animal's dangerousness. The court may admit all relevant evidence, including incident reports and the affidavits of witnesses, limit the scope of discovery, and may shorten the time to produce records or witnesses. In the event that the animal in question has caused severe injury to any person, the municipal judge may impound the animal, at the owner's expense, pending the hearing and determination of the complaint. If the court finds that the animal is potentially dangerous or vicious, it may make any orders authorized by this chapter or other laws, including but not limited to assessment of fines, costs and imprisonment against the owner or keeper as provided in section 1-8. 
(Ord. No. D-05-524, 5-24-05) 
Sec. 3-45. - Notice, hearing and appeal. 
(a)  After the hearing conducted pursuant to section 3-44, the owner or keeper of the animal shall be notified in writing of the determination and orders issued, either personally or by first-class mail postage prepaid by the municipal court. If a determination is made that the animal is potentially dangerous or vicious and no appeal is filed, the owner or keeper shall comply with the municipal court's order no later than fourteen (14) days following the rendering of the decision. If the owner or keeper of the animal contests the determination, he or she may, within fourteen (14) days of the municipal court's decision appeal the decision to the circuit court of the county. All filing fees and costs shall be paid by the owner or keeper of the animal. The owner or keeper of the animal shall serve notice upon the city that the appeal has been filed. 
(b)  The circuit court shall conduct a hearing de novo, and make its own determination as to potential danger and viciousness and make other orders authorized by this chapter, based upon the evidence presented. The court may admit all relevant evidence, including incident reports and the affidavits of witnesses, limit the scope of discovery, and may shorten the time to produce records or witnesses. If the court rules the animal to be potentially dangerous or vicious, compliance with the order shall begin within seven (7) days of the date of the court's determination. 
(c)  The determination of the circuit court shall be final and conclusive upon all parties. However, the animal control authority shall have the right, following due process, to later declare an animal to be vicious or to determine that the animal constitutes a threat to the public health and safety, for any subsequent actions of the animal.

(Ord. No. D-05-524, 5-24-05) 
Sec. 3-47. - When animal may not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious.

When taken by the defendant, he may give bail with sufficient sureties, conditioned that he will appear and abide by the judgment of the appellate court, and failing to give bail he must be committed to the municipal jail; but he may give such bail at any time pending the appeal.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE 

Sec. 6-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in title 11, chapter 19, sections 1-24, chapter 45, sections 1-11, chapter 52, sections 1-84, and title 41, chapter 9, section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Oneonta, Alabama, does ordain as follows. 
( Ord. of 07-28-2009, Art. 1, § A ) 
Sec. 6-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Oneonta, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
( Ord. of 07-28-2009, Art. 1, § B ) 
Sec. 6-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
( Ord. of 07-28-2009, Art. 1, § C ) 
Sec. 6-34. - Objective. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

( Ord. of 07-28-2009, Art. 4, § B ) 
Sec. 6-73. - Floodways. 
(a)  Floodway . Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 6-42, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point; 
(2)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(3)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(4)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
(5)  Only if subsections 6-73(a)(2), (3) or (4), above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
( Ord. of 07-28-2009, Art. 4, § C ) 
Sec. 6-74. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 6-42, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 6-42, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (4) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty-five (25) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of section 6-71 and subsections 6-72(1) through (4). 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of subsection 6-72(3)b.2 in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of sixty (60) inches (five (5) feet). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 6-71(4) "elevated buildings". 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
( Ord. of 07-28-2009, Art. 4, § D ) 
Sec. 6-75. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 6-42, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 6-71(4), "elevated buildings". 
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level or two (2) feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 6-62(1)c and 6-62(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
( Ord. of 07-28-2009, Art. 4, § E ) 
Sec. 6-76. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The zoning board of adjustments as established by City of Oneonta shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board may appeal such decision to the circuit court, as provided in 11-52-81, 1975 Code of Alabama. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board of adjustments may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

(Optional) ] 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §44, Sec. 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) and corresponding parts of this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE II. - FIRE ALARM REGULATIONS (FIRE DEPARTMENT)[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. Z-NFPA-72-98-15A, §§ 1-11, adopted August 11, 1998, pertained to fire alarm regulations and did not specify manner of codification; hence, inclusion of such provisions as §§ 9-31-9-41 was at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 9-31. - Definitions. 
(a)  Fire alarm system means any mechanical, electrical or radio-controlled device in a business which is arranged, designed, or used to signal the occurrence in the city of a fire or medical emergency requiring urgent attention, and to which fire or emergency medical personnel are expected to respond. Fire alarm systems include those through which public safety personnel are notified directly of which signals through central monitoring stations or signals to the fire department. Fire alarms systems also include those designed to register a signal which is so audible, visible, or in other ways perceptible outside of a protected building, structure or facility as to notify persons in the neighborhood beyond the zoning lot where the signal is located who in turn may notify the fire department of the signal. The term does not include smoke detectors not connected to an alarm system that is a part of a single-family or two-family structure. 
(b)  Fire alarm user means the business, including but not limited to any person, firm, corporation, partnership or any other entity who purchases, leases, contracts for, or obtains a fire or medical alarm system. 
(c)  Fire alarm businesses means any business and their authorized designated agents engaged in any of the activities of selling, installing, servicing, altering, leasing, repairing, maintaining, inspecting, testing, replacing, moving, monitoring or responding to an alarm system or causing any of these activities to take place. 
(d)  Automatic telephone dialing device or digital alarm communicator alarm system means an alarm system from a business which is activated by a signal or message and which automatically sends a prerecorded voice message or coded signal by microwave, telephone lines, or other mode of transmittal directly to the central station or monitoring company, indicating the existence of an emergency situation that the alarm system is designated to detect. 
(e)  Calendar year means from January 1 to December 31 of the existing calendar year. 
(f)  Fire official means the fire chief or any other employee of the fire department designated to enforce the provisions of this article. 
(g)  Date of receipt means, for business alarm users and alarm businesses, the date the return receipt accompanying any certified mailing of the notice required to be sent to the alarm user's or alarm businesses' premises pursuant to section 9-35(d) is signed or the day any such notice is delivered to an officer, a director, a general partner or the proprietor of the business, or any employee if an officer is not present on the premises, after notifying the employee of the contents of the notice. 
(h)  False fire alarm means the activation of an alarm system in a business through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligent or intentional misuse of the alarm system by the fire alarm user, fire alarm business, or an employee whereby the fire or medical emergency does not in fact exist. False fire alarm does not include an alarm signal caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm business operator or alarm user. Alarms resulting from the following conditions are not considered false fire alarms: 
(1)  Earthquake causing structural damage to the protected premises. 
(2)  Flooding of the protected premises due to overflow or natural drainage. 
(3)  Lightening bolt causing physical damage to the protected premises. 
(4)  Telephone line malfunction verified in writing to the city by at least a first line telephone company supervisor or by fire department personnel on the scene of an alarm. 
(5)  Notification of the fire department before a unit is dispatched to investigate; that the alarm does not require a response. 
(i)  Fire department means the Fire Department of the City of Oneonta, Alabama and the City of Oneonta's jurisdiction, including, but not limited to its fire suppression services and medical services divisions. 
(j)  Premises means any building or structure or portion thereof for a business which is protected by an alarm system. In the case of two or more buildings or structures or portions thereof on the same property under the same ownership protected by alarm systems that are not connected to a single control system, each building or structure or portion thereof shall be deemed to be separate and distinct premises. 
(k)  Same premises means that the same building or structure or portion thereof protected by an alarm system, without regard to alterations therein, if the identity of the alarm user has not materially changed since the last false fire alarm report. For example, but without limiting the meaning of this definition, a bona fide sale of the premises or the business therein to a third party or the replacement of a tenant by a different tenant shall be deemed a material change of the identity of the alarm user. 
(Ord. No. Z-NFPA-72-98-15A, § 1, 8-11-98) 
Sec. 9-32. - Liability of city. 
    The city and any of its agents and employees shall have no liability or responsibility for the operation or effectiveness of any alarm system and shall not be subject to any claims, demands or actions which may arise out of or in connection with the failure to respond to any alarm.

Sec. 9-33. - Prohibitions. 
(a)  False fire alarms are expressly prohibited in the City of Oneonta, Alabama pursuant to the terms of this article. 
(b)  No person shall install or operate an audible alarm system which emits a sound which is similar to that of an emergency siren or civil defense warning system.

Any failure to respond to the premises within thirty (30) minutes after requested to do so shall be deemed a failure to respond. 
(1)  Failure to respond shall be in violation of this article and shall subject the individual(s) responsible for responding to a municipal fine in an amount up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
(d)  It shall be unlawful to install or maintain an alarm system that does not have an auxiliary power supply that activates in the event of a power failure or electrical outage. 
(Ord. No. Z-NFPA-72-98-15A, § 3, 8-11-98) 
Sec. 9-34. - Penalty. 
(a)  If any business fire alarm user or fire alarm business produces a false fire alarm in any calendar year, the fire official shall provide a written courtesy notice of this fact, by certified mail or hand delivery to the business fire alarm user or fire alarm business. Said notice may request the false fire alarm user or fire alarm business to take corrective action in regard to the false fire alarm, additionally the notice shall inform the false fire alarm user or fire alarm business of the city's fine schedule for false fire alarms. 
(b)  Upon receiving the fourth false fire alarm during a calendar year, the fire official shall issue an affidavit in the municipal court clerk's office, and a warrant shall issue for a violation of this article which shall be prosecuted in the Oneonta Municipal Court. However, an affidavit could be issued after the first false fire alarm at the discretion of the fire official based upon safety considerations. 
(c)  Any subsequent violation of this section within the same calendar year shall be considered a separate violation of this section, and shall result in a second separate affidavit being issued along with a warrant for a violation of this article, thereby mandating municipal court prosecution. This section provides for quasi-civil violations of this article to be punished with the issuance of an affidavit. 
(Ord. No. Z-NFPA-72-98-15A, § 4, 8-11-98) 
Sec. 9-35. - Response to false fire alarms; issuance of courtesy warnings and citations. 
(a)  Whenever an alarm system in a business is activated within the city's jurisdiction, thereby requiring a response to the premises, the fire official on the scene shall inspect the premises, investigate the cause for the alarm, and determine whether or not the response was in fact required. 
(b)  If the fire official determines the fire alarm in such business to have been false, the fire official shall prepare a false fire alarm report and written notice shall be issued to the fire alarm user by certified mail or hand delivery. 
(c)  Also, if the fire department determines a fire alarm to have been false, the fire official may, if a safety threat exists, require the fire alarm user to obtain written certification from a licensed alarm company that the company has inspected the system and that any defects of design, installation or operation of the alarm system, which are identifiable as the cause of the false fire alarm, have been corrected. 
(d)  The issuance of a courtesy letter of warning to the business alarm user or fire alarm business is not intended to create any rights of the alarm user or fire alarm business. The city has the authority to issue an affidavit rather than a letter of warning after the first false fire alarm response to premises. The issuance of a letter of warning is merely a courtesy offered by the fire department to induce the alarm user or fire alarm business to take corrective actions to prevent future false alarms. 
(e)  The fire official shall have the right to inspect any alarm system upon request, to determine whether the alarm system is in proper working order and in compliance with this article. 
(f)  If fire officials respond to the same premises more than once during any twenty-four (24) hour period, only one (1) false fire alarm shall be charged against the alarm user or fire alarm business, unless evidence exists that the alarm user or fire alarm business is harassing the fire department with false fire alarm calls, in such circumstance each false alarm call is a separate violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. Z-NFPA-72-98-15A, § 5, 8-11-98) 
Sec. 9-36. - Permit/registration required; expiration; fees.

Sec. 9-37. - Adequate instructions; copies of regulations. 
(a)  Every alarm business selling, leasing or furnishing to any business an alarm system which is installed on the premises located in the area subject to this article shall furnish the user with instructions that provide information to allow the user to operate the alarm system properly, and to obtain proper service with the alarm system at any time. 
(b)  The fire department shall have copies of this article available for review at the city clerk's office. 
(Ord. No. Z-NFPA-72-98-15A, § 7, 8-11-98)

a.  User must provide to the central station or answering service the names and telephone number of at least three persons who can respond to the premises where the alarm occurred within thirty (30) minutes of being notified at any time with the keys to the premises and the alarm system. This list of names and telephone numbers shall be kept current at all times. The same information shall be supplied to the fire department upon request. Any user of a system other than a fire department central alarm station must supply the same information to the fire department upon request. 
Failure to respond within thirty (30) minutes after the Oneonta Fire Department attempts to notify key holder shall be a violation of the ordinance and shall subject the individual responsible to a fine up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) by the issuance of an affidavit and prosecution in municipal court. 
b.  If the alarm company agrees, it must have one (1) of its representatives respond to the premises where the alarm occurred at any time, with the keys to the premises and alarm system. 
Under this alternative it is still ultimately the owner of the alarm systems responsibility to have keys available within thirty (30) minutes after attempted notification by the Oneonta Fire Department. Failure to do so shall be a violation of the ordinance and shall subject the individual responsible to a fine up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) by the issuance of an affidavit and prosecution in municipal court. 
c.  The user shall install on the outside of the premises a lock box that only the fire department has a key to, which has also been approved by the fire official. This box must contain the keys to the premises and the alarm system. 
If the alarm owner chooses the third option of installing a secured lock box and the Oneonta Fire Department responds to an alarm, then the Oneonta Fire Department will immediately notify the alarm owner and advise him of entry and apparent cause of alarm, such as fire or false alarm. In the event of a false fire alarm, the owner will be responsible to reset all alarms as soon as possible and secure the building. 
(4)  All audible alarm systems shall have a sign or notice posted on or near the audible device with the name and telephone number of the person/or persons responsible for service and maintenance of the system. The notice shall be conspicuously posted and readable from ground level.

Sec. 9-40. - Notification of alarm. 
(a)  Alarm signals initiated by manual fire alarm boxes, automatic fire detectors, waterflow from the automatic sprinkler system, activation of other extinguishing, fire or medical emergency alerting systems shall be treated as emergency fire alarms for the purposes of this article. 
(b)  Any monitored, proprietary or central fire alarm system shall:

(10)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amendable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are amendable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(11)  Waters or wastes containing suspended solids in excess of 300 mg/l. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. V, § 4) 
Sec. 24-105. - Rejection, requiring pretreatment, etc., of wastes. 
    If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in section 24-104 of this division, and which in the judgment of the superintendent, and/or the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the superintendent may: 
(1)  Reject the wastes; 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of section 24-110 of this division. 
    If the superintendent permits the pretreatment of equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the board's engineer and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. V, § 5) 
Sec. 24-106. - Interceptors. 
    Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. V, § 6) 
Sec. 24-107. - Maintenance of preliminary treatment facilities.

(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. V, § 7) 
Sec. 24-108. - Control manholes. 
    When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property services by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the property owner, at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. V, § 8) 
Sec. 24-109. - Measurements, tests. 
    All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reelect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards of life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composition of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples shall be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.) 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. V, § 9) 
Sec. 24-110. - Special agreements. 
    No statement contained in this division shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the board and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the board for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial concern. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. V, § 10) 
Sec. 24-111. - Sewer extensions. 
(a)  Plans specifications required. Any person desiring to extend a public sanitary sewer (that is, any sanitary sewer other than a building sewer) shall submit to the board for review by the board's engineer, plans and specifications for the proposed extensions in two (2) copies. Those plans and specifications shall have been prepared and sealed by an engineer registered as a professional engineer in the State of Alabama and shall conform to all requirements of the ADEM and the utilities board with regard to materials, slopes, alignment, pipe diameters, manhole diameters, compaction and backfill of trenches, pavement replacement, and other construction details. The board shall not issue a permit for extension of a public sanitary sewer until the board's engineer has examined the plans and specifications and certified to the board by a stamp on the plans and specifications noting that the documents are released for construction. The board's engineer shall contact the engineer (whose seal appears on the plans and specifications) if any discrepancies and/or revisions or corrections are found necessary to the submitted plans and specifications. Copies of the utilities board's standard specifications for sanitary sewer may be obtained from the office of the board's engineer, or at the office of the board, at a cost of five dollars ($5.00), or may be inspected at either office, at no charge. 
(b)  Inspection. During construction of sewer extensions, the person desiring that construction shall, during construction of the sewer, furnish inspection by a qualified representative of the engineer whose seal appears on the plans and specifications prior to discharge of sewage to the sewer. 
(c)  Cost for plan review. The cost to the board of the board's engineer in providing the review of the plans and specifications shall not be charged to the person desiring to construct that public sewer extension unless the plans and specifications submitted do not comply with the utility board's standard specifications for sanitary sewers. In the event of noncompliance with the board's standard specifications and engineering services are required by the board's engineer to correct the plans and specifications submitted, the cost to the board for the said engineering services shall be charged to the person desiring to construct said public sewer extension and the billing rate shall be based upon the board's engineer's normal billing rate to the board.

DIVISION 4. - USER CHARGE SYSTEM 

Sec. 24-121. - Adopted. 
    The board shall devise and periodically adopt a user charge system based on actual use of the sewer system by the customers of the board's sewer system, which user charge system shall reflect a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs and minor replacement costs to all customers, with that proportional distribution to be based on the proportionate share of the customer's sanitary sewage flow contribution to the overall flow of the sewer system. Those flows shall be determined based on water records, unless the customer can demonstrate that his water usage is not returned to the sanitary sewer system. Minor losses, as represented by washing of vehicles, lawn watering and other use, shall not be considered as a decrease in the total water usage of a water customer. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. VII, § 1) 
Sec. 24-122. - Operation and maintenance budget. 
    The board shall cause the board's engineer to annually prepare an itemized operation and maintenance budget based on actual projected operating costs, including minor replacement costs. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. VII, § 2) 
Sec. 24-123. - Annual update. 
    The board shall require the board's engineer to annually prepare and update a user charge system, based on the proportional distribution of the O & M costs, plus minor replacement which shall produce enough revenue to cover those costs. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. VII, § 3) 
Sec. 24-124. - Surcharges. 
    In addition to the proportionate distribution of O & M costs plus minor replacement costs, based on flow, the user charge system shall also include surcharges for strength waste in excess of strengths allowed by this article. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. VII, § 4) 
Sec. 24-125. - Charges to be published annually. 
    The proposed sewer user charges as developed by the board's engineer annually shall be published in a newspaper of local distribution at least thirty (30) days prior to its consideration and/or adoption by the utilities board. The board shall receive comments from the public at least one (1) regular board meeting prior to adoption of the user charge system. Comments and discussion at that board meeting shall be considered in any appropriate modifications to the user charge system. Adoption shall be by the board resolution, majority vote required, and shall be in effect until amended by later resolution. 
(Ord. of 1-14-92, Art. VII, § 5) 
Sec. 24-126. - Format for future use charge calculations. 
    Attached to, and made a part of this article, is a format developed by the board's engineer, in compliance with EPA regulations for the general form of the user charge system, which will be the basis for future user charge calculations by the board's engineer.

WATER EMERGENCY STAGES 
Stage 1. Water alert: 
The water alert stage will be implemented when water shortages arc predicted as reported by the local water authority. Public notices and press releases will be provided to notify citizens and businesses of Oneonta of the water shortage situation. The public will be given notice that the Oneonta Water Conservation and Water Emergency Stages has been initiated and that the following voluntary conservation measures, which apply to both residential and commercial properties, be enacted: 
1.  The watering of established lawns and landscaping should be limited to the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. on each allowable watering day. Addresses ending in an even number should water established lawns and landscaping on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Addresses ending in an odd number should water on Wednesdays and Sundays. 
2.  New lawns and landscaping are exempt from the day of the week restrictions for the first thirty (30) days of installation. However, such watering shall be limited to the minimum necessary. Watering should be conducted between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. Documentation to verify the date of planting shall be made available upon request. Hand watering, using hoses with shut-off valves or nozzles, is not restricted but should be limited to the minimum amount necessary. 
3.  Watering for the purpose of applying insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides where such watering is required by the manufacturer or by federal, state or local law shall not be restricted by days of the week. However, such watering shall be limited to the minimum necessary. Documentation to verify the date of application shall be made available upon request. 
4.  The washing of personal motor vehicles or equipment shall be permitted by means of a "bucket" and "sponge" and a hose with a shut off nozzle. Commercial car washes using recycled water may continue normal operation. 
5.  Hosing down of porches, sidewalks, driveways and other hard surfaces, except of health and safety reasons should be suspended unless performed by a commercial pressure washer. 
6.  Golf courses should water the first nine (9) holes Mondays and Thursdays, and the bottom nine (9) holes should be watered on Tuesdays and Fridays. 
7.  Newly constructed or existing public and private swimming pools, which include outdoor hot tubs, spas and Jacuzzis, may be filled once upon completion. One-time draining and subsequent re-filling of swimming pools is allowed only for repairs if conditions threaten the integrity of the pool and/or its supporting infrastructure. 
8.  Commercial nurseries are exempt from day of the week watering but shall restrict water use to the minimum. 
Stage 2. Water warning: 
The water warning stage shall be implemented when "severe" water shortage conditions are reported by the local water authority and the voluntary conservation measures described in stage 1: water alert have not sufficiently reduced system demands. At this stage, the city ordinance for a water warning will be implemented with a declaration by the board. 
1.  The watering of established lawns and landscaping is limited to the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. on the allowable watering day. Addresses ending in an even number should water established lawns and landscaping on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Addresses ending in an odd number should water on Wednesdays and Sundays. 
2.  New lawns and landscaping are exempt from the day of the week restrictions for the first thirty (30) days after installation. Water shall be limited to the minimum necessary and can be conducted between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. After the first thirty day (30) days, watering is restricted to two (2) days per week on the even/odd address days and times listed in 1. above. 
3.  The washing of private motor vehicles or equipment shall be suspended. Commercial car washing shall be suspended unless recycled water is used. 
4.  The use of fire hydrants for any purpose except fire fighting or flushing sewers for health protection shall be suspended. 
5.  The water of any portion of golf courses, except for tees and greens, shall be suspended. The watering of tees and greens is allowed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. Hand misting is permitted on other days of the week. 
6.  Commercial nurseries shall restrict watering to the minimum amount necessary to maintain plants. 
7.  Newly constructed or existing public and private swimming pools, which include outdoor hot tubs, spas and Jacuzzis, may be filled once upon completion. One-time draining and subsequent re-filling of swimming pools is allowed only for repairs if conditions threaten the integrity of the pool or its supporting infrastructure. 
8.  Watering from private lakes, streams, wells or ponds must post visible signs if deviating from the schedule set forth above. 
Stage 3. Water emergency: 
The Water emergency stage will be implemented when "extreme" drought conditions exist. The board shall have the authority to declare a "water emergency" when public health, safety and sanitary standards are at risk. This "water emergency" stage shall ban all non-essential outdoor water usage. The use and withdrawal of water by any person for the following purposes shall be prohibited unless expressly permitted by the ordinance. 
1.  Outdoor watering. The watering or irrigation of lawns and landscaping shall only be allowed on weekends. Addresses ending on an even number shall water on Saturdays between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. and addresses ending in an odd number shall water on Sundays between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. (Commercial nurseries shall restrict watering to the minimum amount necessary to maintain plants.) 
2.  Washing mobile equipment. The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, trailer houses, railroad cars or any other type of mobile equipment is prohibited. 
3.  Cleaning outdoor surfaces. The washing of sidewalks, driveways, gas stations aprons, porches and other outdoor surfaces is prohibited. 
4.  Cleaning buildings, equipment and machinery. The washing of the outside of dwellings and commercial buildings, and the cleaning of equipment and machinery is prohibited. 
5.  Ornamental fountains. The operation of any ornamental fountains or other structures making similar use of water is prohibited. 
6.  Golf Courses and Athletic Fields. Except for the hand watering of greens on golf courses, the watering of golf courses and athletic fields is prohibited. 
7.  [Visible signage.] Watering from private lakes, stream, wells or ponds must post visible signs if deviating from the restrictions set forth. 
County health department officer shall have the authority to permit reasonable use of water to maintain public health, safety and sanitary standards. However, this reasonable use shall not include any of the restrictions in this section. 
Stage 4. Water system failure: 
The board strongly endorses and recommends that the various water systems being served work out reciprocal emergency water use agreements and install adequate connections to allow the transfer of water from one system to another in times of drought or other disaster causing shortages. Furthermore, it is recommended that similar agreements be worked out with other water systems that are geographically located to make such agreements workable and beneficial. This stage could result from drought intensity or other unrelated causes for the potable water supply system failure. In this stage, a significant or total failure of a water distribution system will have disastrous effect on the City. At this juncture, notification of the federal and state agencies for assistance would be required. Emergency operation center (EOC) would be opened for the duration of the event. Priority will be placed on public safety and public health.

The Zoning regulations and district as herein established have been made in accordance with a comprehensive
plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to

suitability for particular uses; and with a view to conserving the value to buildings and encouraging the most
appropriate use of land throughout the city.
5
ARTICLE
III. GENERAL REGULATIONS
Section 1.0. General Use Regulations.
The following general regulations pertain to the administration, enforcement of, and compliance with
this Ordinance.
1.1 Application of the Ordinance. No structure shall be constructed, erected, planed or maintained
and no land use commenced or continued within the City of Oneonta except as specifically or by
necessary implication, authorized by this Ordinance.
1.2 Except as Otherwise Provided in This Ordinance.
A. No land may be used except for a purpose permitted in the district in which it is located.
B. No building shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally,
nor shall any building be used except for a use permitted in the district in which the
building is located.
C. No building shall be erected, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered
except in conformity with the area regulations and height limit of the district in which the
building is located.
D. The minimum building line, parking spaces, open spaces, including lot area per family,
required by this Ordinance for each and every building existing at the time of the passage
of the Ordinance or for any building hereafter erected, shall not be encroached upon or
considered as required building or open space for any other building, nor shall any lot
area be reduced below the requirements of this Ordinance.
E. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on a lot as herein
defined and in no case shall there be more than one main building and one main use on
one lot. Accessory structures shall not include living quarters; neither will sanitary
facilities be permitted in accessory structures without the approval of the Oneonta City
Council.
1.3 Joint Occupancy.
No structure shall be erected, structurally altered for, or used as a single-family
or two-family dwelling simultaneously with any other use.
1.4 Public Utilities.
Utility structures including, but not limited to, poles, wires, crossarms, transformers attached to
poles, guy wires, insulators, conduits and other facilities necessary for the transmission or
distribution of electric power or to provide telephone or telegraph service and pipe lines, vents,
valves, hydrants, regulator, meters and other facilities necessary for the transmission or
distribution of gas, oil, water or other utilities may be constructed, erected, repaired, maintained
6
or replaced within any district within the City. This is not to be construed to include the erection
or construction of buildings, (See district regulations for public utility facilities and services).
Section 2.0. Non-Conforming Uses.
Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may be later adopted, there exist
lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the Ordinance
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendment, it is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-conformities to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that Nonconformities
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, nor used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
2.1 Non-Conforming Lots of Record.
Where a lot of record at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance had less area or less
width than herein required for the district in which it is located, said lot may not the less be used
as a building sire provided the yard space and other requirements conform as closely as possible
in the opinion of the Board of Adjustment for the district in which it is located. However, this
provision shall not apply when two (2) or more such lots exist with continuous frontage in single
ownership at the time of passage of this Ordinance or any time thereafter. Such land shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this Ordinance and shall not be used or
sold in a manner, which creates lot width or area below the requirements stated in this
Ordinance.
2.2 Continuance.
A lawful non-conforming use existing at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance may be
continued, except as hereafter provided, although such use does not conform with the provisions
of this Ordinance.
2.3 Restoration to Safe Condition.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the restoration of any building or structure to a safe or
sanitary condition when required by the proper authorities.
2.4 Restoration After Damages.
No non-conforming building or structure which has been damaged by fire or other causes to the
extent of more than 50 per-cent of its current replacement value at the time of such damage shall
be rebuilt or restored, except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. If a nonconforming
building is damaged less than 50 per-cent of its current replacement value it may be
rebuilt or restored and used as before the damage.
7
2.5 Abandonment.
A non-conforming use, which has been discontinued for a continuous period of one year, shall
not be reestablished and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance.
2.6 Change In Use.
A non-conforming use shall not be changed to another non-conforming use.
2.7 Abandoned Right-Of-Way.
Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the
City of Oneonta, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall
be automatically extended to the center of same and all area included therein shall then be
subject to all appropriate regulations to the extended district.
2.8 Structures Conforming to District Regulations But Not Other Regulations.
A structure or building conforming to the use regulations of a district, but not conforming to
other provisions of this Ordinance, may be enlarged or altered provided, that such enlargement or
alteration conforms to the provision of this Ordinance.
2.9 Buildings To Be Moved.
Any building or structure which is to be moved to any location within the City Limits of
Oneonta, shall be considered for the purpose of this Ordinance to be a new building under
construction, and as such shall conform to the applicable provisions of this Ordinance.
2.10 Reduction in Lot Area Prohibited.
No lot shall be reduced in area so that yards and other open spaces total less than the minimum
area required under this Ordinance. However, where a lot of official record at the time of
adoption of this ordinance does not consist of sufficient land to enable the owner to conform to
the yard and other requirements of this Ordinance, such lot may be used as a building sire
provided in the opinion of the Zoning Board of Adjustment it conforms as closely as possible to
the requirements of the district in which it is located. (Also see subsection 2.1)
2.11 Dwelling Prohibitions.
No dwelling shall be erected on a lot, which does not abut on at lease one (1) improved street for
at least twenty-five (25) feet. No building in the rear of the main building on the same lot may
be used for residential purposes.
2.12 Corner Visibility in Residential and Commercial Districts.
In a residential or commercial district, no fence, wall, shrubbery, sign, marquee, or other
obstructions to vision between the heights of three and one-half (3 ½) feet and fifteen (15) feet
above street level shall be permitted with twenty (20) feet of the intersection of the right-of-way
lines of two streets or railroads or of a street and a railroad right-of-way line.
8
2.13 Future Street Lines.
On any lot which at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, or at the time this Ordinance is
changed by amendment hereafter, may be reduced in area by widening a public street to a future
street line as indicated on the duly adopted Major Street Plan, or as same may be hereafter
amended, the minimum required yards, the minimum required lot area, the minimum required lot
width and maximum building area shall be measured by considering the future street line as the
lot line of such lot.
2.14 Abatement of Noise, Smoke, Gas, Vibration, Fumes, Dust, Fire and Explosion Hazard or
Nuisance.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment may require the conduct of any use, conforming or nonconforming
use, which results in unreasonable noise, smoke, gas, vibration, fumes, dust, fire,
radio interference, or explosion, hazard or nuisance to surrounding property to be modified or
changed to abate such hazard to health, comfort and convenience. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment may direct the Building Inspector to issue an abatement order, but such order may be
directed only after a public hearing by the said Board, notice of which shall be sent by registered
mail to the owners and/or operators of the property on which the use is conducted in addition to
due notice by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation. A hearing to consider
issuance of an abatement order shall be held by the Zoning Board of Adjustment only upon
reasonable evidence of hazard or nuisance and such order shall specify the date by which the
hazard or nuisance shall be abated.

and intended use of such structure in all respects conforms with the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 3.0. Plot Plan.

building permit be accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale, dimensioned, and showing the
following in sufficient detail to enable the Building Inspector to ascertain whether the proposed
development is in conformance with this ordinance:
1. The actual shape, proportion and dimensions of the lot to be built upon.
2. The shape, size and location of all buildings or other structures to be erected, altered or
moved and of any building or other structures already on the lot, both above and below

Section 7.0. Interpretation of Uses.
This Ordinance recognizes the limitation of the district use listings given the infinite variations of
essentially similar uses. Therefore, the Building Inspector is empowered to make interpretations so as to
classify any questioned use within a listed use of most similar impact and characteristics. However, in no case
shall the Building Inspector interpret a use as falling in one listed use when the use in question is more similar
in impact and characteristics to another listed use. Appeal to the Building Inspectors use interpretation may be
filed with the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
12

Adjustment.
2. If the unclassified use would not be compatible with the intent of the existing zoning district
intent, the Building Inspector shall determine the most appropriate district classification and
require the property in question to be rezoned. In addition, the unclassified use shall be
permitted in the new district by special exception if granted approval by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment.
3. Following final action on the unclassified use, as (1) or (2) above may require, the Planning
Commission shall initiate an amendment to this Ordinance to list the newly permitted use into
the most appropriate district(s).

13.4 Administrative Review.
To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that an error exists in any order, requirement,

Ordinance.
Section 14.0. Special Exceptions.
To hear and decide such special exceptions as the Zoning Board of Adjustment is specifically authorized
to pass on by the terms of this Ordinance, certain land uses are identified for special treatment. The nature of
these uses is such that when properly regulated, they are appropriate in several zones. In order to bring about
the proper integration of these uses into the Citys land use pattern, a special set o standards are provided for
14
each use. Review of these standards will tend to maintain compatibility with adjoining land uses. It is intended
that the Zoning Board of Adjustment will review all proposals for these special exception uses for compliance
with the appropriate provisions of Article VI, Supplemental Regulations before approval is granted and a
building permit is issued.
14.1 Special Exception Procedures.
All uses listed as permitted by special exception shall require the submission of an application to
the Zoning Board of Adjustment. An application for a special exception shall be filed with the
Building Inspector at least 30 days before the scheduled hearing date before the Zoning Board of
Adjustment. The application shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized agent of the
owner on a form made available by the Building Inspector and shall include the following
information and materials.
1. Name, signature, and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner, if
any.
2. Address of the property under consideration.
3. Zoning and land use of the property under consideration.
4. Proposed use by special exception.
5. A vicinity map showing the location of the property.
6. A plot plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the property boundaries and
proposed development layout.
7. Stamped No. 10 envelopes (legal size) with the names and addresses of adjacent property
owner (including those directly across a public right-of-way), as shown in the most recent
records of the Blount County Tax Assessor.
8. A $125.00 filing fee.
A. Public Notice. At least 15 days prior to the scheduled Zoning Board of Adjustment hearing, the
Building Inspector shall give written notice of the proposal to all adjacent property owners. Such
notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage
prepared, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as submitted with the application.
The notice shall state the following information:
1. The name of the applicant.
2. The location of the property.
3. The proposed use by special exception.
4. The time, date and location of the Zoning Board of Adjustment meeting.
14.2 Variances.
15
To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will
not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.
A. Justification. Variances to the terms of this chapter may be granted individual cases upon
finding by the Zoning Board of Adjustment that the variance will not be contrary to the public
interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provision of this chapter
subject to a variance will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall
be observed and substantial justice done. More specifically, the Board shall determine all of the
following criteria have been satisfied:
1. The Board should make proper adjustment to prevent unnecessary hardship. Even to the
extent of authorizing nonconforming uses. Where the Board authorizes a nonconforming
use in a district to prevent unnecessary hardship, all relevant factors, when taken together,
must indicate that the plight of the premises in question is unique in that they cannot be
put reasonably to a conforming use because of the limitations imposed upon them by
reason of their classification in a specific zone.
2. Variances should be permitted only under peculiar and exceptional circumstances.
3. Hardship alone is not sufficient; Alabama statutes require unnecessary hardship.
4. Mere financial loss of a kind, which might be common to all to the property owners in a
district, is not an unnecessary hardship.
5. Variances should be granted sparingly, and spirit of this chapter in harmony with the
spirit of State law should be carefully preserved, to the end that the structure of this
section would not disintegrate and fall apart by constant erosion at the hands of the
Board.
6. When a hardship is self-inflicted or self-created, there is no basis for claim that a variance
should be granted.
B. Application. An application for a variance shall be filed with the Building Inspector at least 30
days before the scheduled hearing date before the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The application
shall be filed by the property owner or the authorized agent of the owner on a form made
available by the Building Inspector and shall include the following information and materials:
1. Name, signature and address of the property owner and agent of the property owner, if
any.
2. Address of the property under consideration.
3. Zoning and land use of the property under consideration.
4. Nature of the variance with reference to applicable zoning provisions.
5. Justification for the variance in accordance with all of the criteria in (a) above.
6. A vicinity map showing the location of the property.
16
7. A plot plan, drawn to scale and dimensioned, showing the property boundaries and
proposed development layout with the variance noted or highlighted.
8. Stamped No. 10 envelopes (legal size) with the names and addresses of adjacent property
owner (including those directly across a public right-or-way), as shown in the most recent
records of the Blount County Tax Assessor.
9. A $125.00 filing fee.
C. Public Notice. At least 15 days prior to the scheduled Zoning Board of Adjustment hearing, the
Building Inspector shall give written notice of the variance to all adjacent property owners. Such
notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the United States mail, first class postage
prepared, addressed to such property owners at their addresses as submitted with the application.
The notice shall state the following information:
1. The name of the applicant.
2. The location of the property
3. The nature of the variance and the applicable zoning provisions.
4. The time, date and location of the Board hearing.
14.3 Action on Appeals.
In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may, so long as
such action is in conformity with the terms of this Ordinance, reverse, or affirm, wholly or partly,
or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to
that end shall have powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.
The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Building Official, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance, or to effect any
variation in the application of this Ordinance.
14.4 Appeals-How Taken.
Appeals to the Zoning Board of Adjustment may be taken by any persons aggrieved or by any
officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the administrative
official. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days of such
lesser period as may be provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the Building Official
and with the Zoning Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
administrative official shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting when which
the action appealed from was taken.
14.5. Stay of Proceedings.
An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Building
Official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Zoning Board of Adjustment after the
17
notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in
his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed other than by a retraining order which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Adjustment
or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Building Official from whom the appeal is
taken and on due cause shown.
14.6 Appeals From Action of the Board.

therefrom to the circuit court or court of like jurisdiction as provided by Section 11-52-81, Code

visual barrier will be uniformly dense at the minimum height required.
B. A solid opaque fence, a brick or masonry wall, or earth berm.
20.2 General Requirements for Buffers/Screening.
Specifications for buffers shall be determined by the Planning Commission in its review of site
development plans at minimum, buffers shall meet the following criteria: If a natural barrier is
specified in the buffer strip, such barrier shall be a planting strip so planted that within one full
growing season after installation, said planting strip shall provide a visually impervious barrier,
uniformly dense at all heights from the ground, and a minimum of 4 feet tall throughout the
entire length of the planting strip. The entire surface area of the buffer shall be planted with trees
and/or shrubs. Within 3 full growing seasons after installation, said planting strip shall have
reached a minimum height of 6 feet in height or greater.
A. If man-made screening methods are specified, the following shall apply:
1. Screening materials shall be continuously maintained, present an attractive
exterior appearance and be of durable construction.
2. Unless otherwise noted, acceptable screening materials include wood stockade
fences, decorative masonry walls, brick walls, and earth berms. Screening walls
or fences shall be minimum of six (6) feet in height (or as modified by the
Planning Commission) but not to exceed three (3) feet in any required front yard.
3. Location of screening shall not obstruct the visibility of traffic circulation.
B. Buffers shall be of sufficient width, height, and opacity, and density to eliminate the
adverse impact on adjacent single family residences.
20.3 Modification or Waiver.
The screening and planting requirements of this section shall be applied equally to all similarly
classified and situated properties but may be modified or waived altogether in certain cases
where a building site is subject to any of the following circumstances, as determined by the
Planning Commission.
89
A. Where natural vegetation (trees and/or shrubs) exist on a piece of property when
application is made for a building permit, a strip of natural vegetation shall be left
undisturbed until the Building Inspector has evaluated it with regard to the width
requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance for that specific use and zone. The
Building Inspector may require that the developer retain a portion of the natural
vegetation as a greenbelt, where natural vegetation (trees and/or shrubs) already exists,
rather than require a man-made planting strip. However, such vegetation shall be
adequate in density to provide the desired barrier;
B. Where impending development of adjacent property would make these standards
unreasonable or impractical;
C. Where, after inspection by the Building Inspector, it is found that two different and
incompatible zone districts abut each other, but are separated by a street or alley, or
where the view from the adjoining district is blocked by a change in grade or other
natural or man-made features;
D. Where a greenbelt or planting strip cannot reasonably be expected to thrive due to soil
conditions, intense shade or similar conditions;
E. Fencing, where installed, shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy;
F. All plantings shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition by the party or
parties required to provide such plantings and, when necessary, replaced with new
growth. All fencing shall be permanently maintained in good condition, and whenever
necessary, repaired or replaced by the party or parties required to provide such fence.
G. In special cases where the side and/or rear yards may be inadequate to meet the width
requirements for the buffer strip, as set forth in each respective zone district, the Planning
Commission shall determine, based on the site plan review or other pertinent information
required, an alternative method of separation.
