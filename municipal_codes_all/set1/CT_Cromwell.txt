ARTICLE IV
Employees Entitled to Participate
§ 54-11. Conditions of eligibility.
A. Every employee of the Town, on January 1, 1989, shall be eligible to
become a participant hereunder on the first day of the month following
the date on which he shall have completed his probationary period.
[Amended BOS 2-8-1989]
B. Date of eligibility. [Amended BOS 2-10-1982]
(1) Every person who shall become an employee of the Town subsequent
to September 1, 1965, and before December 31, 1979, shall be
eligible to become a participant hereunder on the first day of the
month following the date on which he shall have been employed
continuously by the Town as an employee for 24 months and shall
have reached his 25th birthday, provided that he shall not have
attained his 53rd birthday.
(2) Every person who shall become an employee of the Town subsequent
to June 30, 1982, and all employees who are not yet participants,
shall be eligible to become a participant on the first day of the
month following the date on which he shall have been continuously
employed by the Town as an employee for six months, provided that
such employee agrees to contribute.
(3) Every person who shall become an employee of the Town subsequent
to January 1, 1989, and all employees who are not yet participants
shall be eligible to become a participant on the first day following the
completion of his probationary period, provided that such employee
agrees to contribute. [Added BOS 2-8-1989]
C. The Board shall notify each eligible employee of the Town of his
eligibility. Any such eligible employee desiring to become a participant
hereunder shall file with the Board his election to become a participant
hereunder on a form as provided in Subsection D hereof prior to the date
on which he first becomes eligible to become a participant; provided,
however, that in special cases the Board may extend the time within
which such election must be filed. Failure to file such election within
the prescribed time shall constitute a waiver by such employee of all
benefits he would otherwise have received by becoming a participant
hereunder on the date on which he first became eligible. Any employee
who does not elect to become a participant hereunder on the date
when he first becomes entitled to participate hereunder may elect to
become a participant on any subsequent anniversary date, provided that
he shall then meet all of the requirements of Subsection B, but such
participant shall not be entitled to any credited service for employment
with the Town prior to participation in the plan. Anything contained
in this subsection to the contrary notwithstanding, with respect to the
first anniversary date of the plan, eligible employees may be notified
of their eligibility and file election forms after the September 1, 1965,
anniversary date under such rules as the Board shall establish.
D. The election form shall contain such information as the Board shall
require and shall authorize the deduction of any such participant's
§ 54-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 54-11
1:29
contributions which may be required hereunder from such participant's
pay in such manner as the Board shall require.
§ 54-12. Interruptions in employment.
If a participant's status as an employee of the Town is terminated or
interrupted for more than five months in any twelve-month period, except
in the case of a leave of absence, and thereafter he resumes his status as
an employee, he shall be deemed to be a new employee from the date of
such reemployment or resumption, and his period of employment shall be
counted from such date.

ARTICLE V
Benefits
§ 54-13. Benefit formula. [Amended STM 12-14-1972; BOS
2-1-1977; BOS 2-10-1982]
Each participant at retirement on his normal, early or deferred retirement
date on or after June 30, 1982, shall be entitled to an annual retirement
benefit commencing on his normal, early or deferred retirement date,
payable in monthly installments for life thereafter, equal to 1.5% of his
average final compensation multiplied by his years of credited service.
§ 54-14. Contingent annuitant option.
Instead of the normal monthly retirement benefit provided under § 54-13, a
participant may elect a contingent annuitant option providing for actuarially
reduced monthly retirement benefits payable to him during his lifetime after
retirement and for the continuance of such payments or a part of them
specified by the participant to a contingent annuitant for his life after the
death of the retired participant. Such election may be made by a participant
at any time at least one year prior to his retirement date or within one year
prior to his retirement date upon furnishing evidence of the participant's
good health satisfactory to the Board. A participant who has elected this
option may not at any time within one year prior to his retirement date
revoke or modify such option, except upon furnishing evidence of good
health of the contingent annuitant satisfactory to the Board; provided,
however, that the death of the contingent annuitant at any time prior to
the participant's retirement date shall automatically revoke such election,
and further provided that if the contingent annuitant is the spouse of
the participant, a divorce granted to either spouse at any time prior to
the participant's retirement date shall automatically revoke such election.
If a participant who has elected this option dies before his retirement
date, no benefits under this option shall be payable to the contingent
annuitant. If the participant dies after his retirement date, the contingent
annuitant shall receive for life, commencing on the first day of the calendar
month coinciding with or next following the retired participant's death, the
benefits specified by the retired participant for the contingent annuitant.
If the contingent annuitant dies before the participant's retirement date,
the monthly retirement benefit normally provided under this plan will be
payable to the retired participant as if this option had not been elected. If
the contingent annuitant dies after the participant's retirement date, the
amount of the payments which the retired participant is then receiving or is
entitled to receive will continue unchanged and will cease upon the retired
participant's death.
§ 54-15. Ten-year certain option.
Each participant shall have the option, to be exercised by a written direction
to the Board, to elect to have actuarially reduced monthly retirement
benefits payable for 10 years certain and for his life thereafter. Such
§ 54-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 54-15
1:31
election may be made by a participant at any time at least one year prior
to his retirement date or within one year prior to his retirement date
upon furnishing evidence of good health satisfactory to the Board. Upon
the death of a retired participant after his retirement date but before 120
monthly payments have been made to him, if he shall have effectively
elected such a ten-year option, then the balance of such 120 monthly
payments shall be made to such beneficiary as he shall have most recently
designated in a written instrument signed by him in the presence of one
subscribing witness and filed with the Board, either before or after his
retirement. If no such designation is on file with the Board at the time of
death or is defective for any reason or if such beneficiary shall predecease
the retired participant, then the estate of such retired participant shall
receive the commuted value of such benefit payable in a lump sum. If the
beneficiary, having survived the retired participant, dies before all of said
120 payments have been made, then the commuted value of the balance
of said payments shall be paid in a lump sum to the beneficiary's estate. If
the participant dies before his retirement date, no benefits shall be payable
under this option.
§ 54-16. Early retirement option.
Each participant who shall have reached his 55th birthday and shall have at
least 15 years of credited service shall have the option, to be exercised by
a written notice to the Board and with the consent of the Board, to retire
at any time thereafter prior to his normal retirement date. The amount of
retirement benefits payable to such retired participant shall be computed
as provided in § 54-13 hereof, except that the date of such early retirement
shall be used in determining his credited service, and the amount thus
obtained will be reduced, such reduction to be determined by the actuary
in accordance with accepted actuarial practices, if such retirement benefit
is to commence prior to such participant's normal retirement date. The
contingent annuitant and the ten-year certain options, provided for in
§§ 55-14 and 54-15 hereof, may be elected by a participant who elects to
retire early under this section, in which case the term "retirement date"
shall be deemed to mean early retirement date wherever applicable in
§§ 54-14 and 54-15.
§ 54-17. Social security option.
If the commencement of retirement benefits under the Federal Social
Security Act does not coincide with the early retirement date selected by
a participant under § 54-16, a participant retiring in accordance with the
provisions of § 54-16, before social security payments begin, shall have the
further option, to be exercised by a written request to the Board and with
the consent of the Board, to receive an actuarially equivalent retirement
income providing larger monthly payments in lieu of the retirement income
otherwise payable under § 54-16 upon early retirement, until the date upon
which his retirement benefits under the Federal Social Security Act shall
commence, at which time his monthly payments hereunder shall be reduced
by the approximate amount of the social security retirement benefit, which
§ 54-15 CROMWELL CODE § 54-17
1:32
the participant will receive, so that, insofar as practical, a level total
retirement income will be available for the participant. Election of such
social security option by a participant shall automatically revoke any
contingent annuitant option or ten-year certain option which may have been
elected by such participant.
§ 54-18. Deferred retirement. [Amended BOS 2-8-1989]
Any participant may continue in the employ of the Town beyond his normal
retirement date and receive credited service while he continues as an
employee. The Town shall continue to make contributions on behalf of any
participant who defers his retirement under the provisions of this section,
and such participant shall continue his contributions as provided in § 54-23
of Article VIII. Such participant's retirement benefits will commence on his
retirement date, and his retirement benefit shall be computed as provided
in § 54-13 hereof, except that his deferred date of retirement shall be used
in determining his credited service.
§ 54-19. Benefits limited to assets of trust fund.
The benefits provided for herein shall be only such as can be provided by
the assets of the trust fund. In the event of the termination of this plan, as
provided for in Article X or otherwise, there shall be no liability or obligation
on the part of the Town to make any further contributions to the trustee for
the purposes of this plan or otherwise.
§ 54-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 54-19
1:33

ARTICLE VI
Benefits Upon Death of Participant
§ 54-20. No direct death benefit payable.
Except as provided for in § 54-21 hereof regarding return of contributions
and in the contingent annuitant and ten-year certain options in Article V
hereof, no death benefits shall be payable hereunder upon the death of a
participant or retired participant.
§ 54-21. Return of contributions. [Amended BOS 2-1-1977]
Upon the death of a participant prior to his retirement and the
commencement of retirement benefits or upon the death of a terminated
participant who shall have left his contributions in the trust fund as
provided in § 54-22 hereof, there shall be paid from the trust fund to his
beneficiary designated, as provided in § 54-15 hereof, an amount equal to
his contributions to the trust fund, plus interest thereon computed at the
annual rate of 3% prior to July 1, 1976, and at the annual rate of 5%
thereafter, compounded annually to the date of his death. Upon the death
of a retired participant who has not elected the contingent annuitant or
ten-year certain options before there shall have been paid to the retired
participant the amount of his contributions to the trust fund, plus interest
thereon computed at the annual rate of 3% prior to July 1, 1976, and at the
annual rate of 5% thereafter, compounded annually to his actual retirement
date, then the amount of such contributions, plus such compound interest,
less the amount of pension benefits paid to such retired participant prior to
his death, shall be paid to the retired participant's beneficiary designated,
as provided in § 54-15 hereof.
§ 54-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 54-21
1:35

ARTICLE VII
Termination of Employment
§ 54-22. Payments required. [Amended BOS 2-1-1977]
A. If any participant shall cease to be an employee of the Town, except upon
death or as a retired participant or except as provided in Article IX hereof
for leave of absence, then he shall be entitled to a return of all of his
own contributions to the trust fund, plus interest thereon computed at the
annual rate of 3% prior to July 1, 1976, and at the annual rate of 5%
thereafter, compounded annually to date of termination; provided, however,
that any participant who shall elect to leave his contributions in the trust
fund shall be entitled at his normal retirement date, if he shall then be
living and if such contributions are left in the trust fund, to the following
percentage of the amount of retirement benefit as computed under the
provisions of § 54-13 hereof, such percentage to depend upon the number
of his full years of credited service under the plan following his entry date,
except that the date of such termination shall be used in determining his
credited service:
Years of Credited Service Under
the Plan
Percent of Accrued Benefit
Vested
Fewer than 10 0%
10 or more 100%
B. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
shall the vested benefit to which the terminated participant is entitled be
of lesser value than the amount of his own contributions, including interest
as hereinabove provided, at the date of his termination of employment as
determined by the actuary in accordance with accepted actuarial practice,
and in no event shall the vested percentage indicated above be less than
the percentage that would have been applicable if the participant had
terminated employment on June 30, 1976. Any such terminated participant
may elect, by written notice filed with the Board at least 60 days prior to
an anniversary date, to withdraw, as of the next succeeding anniversary
date, his own contributions to the trust fund, plus interest thereon, to such
anniversary date computed as hereinabove provided. If any such terminated
participant shall so elect to withdraw his own contributions, then he shall
have no further rights whatsoever in and to any benefits under this plan.

Any such leave of absence must be given in advance and, except in cases
involving military service, such leave of absence may be canceled at any
time, in the discretion of the Board.
§ 54-27. Applicability on participation.
The provisions of the plan relating to termination of employment will not
apply to any participant absent on leave of absence granted in accordance
with § 54-26 of this article, but the following rules shall apply to such
participant:
A. As long as such participant continues on leave of absence, as provided
in § 54-26 of this article, the Town contributions otherwise required to
provide the benefits for such participant set forth in this plan shall be
suspended.
B. If such participant returns to active employment with the Town within
90 days following the end of such leave of absence, he shall continue
as a participant hereunder as though he had continued in the active
employment of the Town during such leave of absence. The Town
contributions on behalf of such participant shall be resumed with such
adjustments as the actuary shall determine to be necessary to provide
the benefits set forth in this plan for such participant at his retirement.
C. If such participant does not return to active employment with the Town
within 90 days following the end of such leave of absence, the
employment of such participant shall be deemed to have been
terminated as of the commencement of such leave of absence, and he
shall be entitled to benefits provided under Article VII hereof as of such
date.
§ 54-28. Effect on eligibility and service.
During a period of such leave of absence, an employee on such leave of
absence shall be deemed to be in continuous employment of the Town for
the purposes of the eligibility requirements of Article IV hereof and for the
purpose of credited service, as defined in Article II hereof, provided that
such employee returns to active employment with the Town within 90 days
following the end of his leave of absence.

1:41
contained in this plan to the contrary notwithstanding, such employee
shall not be entitled to credited service during the period of such leave of
absence nor shall the period of such leave of absence be included for the
purpose of determining the percentage of his vested benefit under § 54-22,
but he shall be deemed to be in the continuous employment of the Town
for the purpose of the eligibility requirements of Article IV hereof. Such
participant may elect to terminate his leave of absence and be treated as
a terminated participant under § 54-22 hereof by notice, in writing, to the
Board.

ARTICLE X
Discontinuance of Plan
§ 54-30. Right to terminate.
Although the Town hopes to continue the plan and the contributions to the
trust indefinitely, the Town may, by action at a Town Meeting, terminate
the plan and all further contributions thereunder for any reason and at any
time. If the Town temporarily discontinues its contributions or suspends
them in whole or in part and if such temporary discontinuance becomes
a permanent discontinuance, such permanent discontinuance shall be
deemed to constitute termination of the plan as of the date the contributions
were first discontinued.
§ 54-31. Allocation of assets upon termination. [Amended BOS
2-1-1977]
In the event of termination of the plan, the Board shall first allocate an
amount of the trust fund to each participant, retired participant, contingent
annuitant or the beneficiary of a deceased participant equal to the amount
of the contributions to the trust fund made by such participant, retired
participant or deceased participant, plus interest thereon compounded
annually, less all amounts received from the trust fund by such participant,
retired participant, contingent annuitant or beneficiary. Such amounts so
allocated shall be paid to the respective participant, retired participant,
contingent annuitant or beneficiary, unless a written election is made by
such person to have the amount to which he is so entitled held in trust
and added to the amount, if any, which shall be set aside for his benefit
under the terms of the following sentence. The remaining net assets in
the trust fund, after deduction of all termination expenses, shall then be
allocated by the Board in an equitable manner among the participants,
retired participants, terminated participants, contingent annuitants and
beneficiaries of deceased participants in the following order of precedence,
and such allocation shall be final:
Order of
Precedence Classification at Date of Termination
Class I Participants who have passed their normal
retirement date and whose retirement benefits have
been deferred under the terms of § 54-18 hereof,
retired participants, contingent annuitants and
beneficiaries of deceased participants

trust fund or a new trust fund or purchase of insurance or annuity contracts
as the Board shall determine.
§ 54-33. Restrictions imposed to meet federal regulations.
A. The following restrictions imposed by the provisions of this section are
included solely to meet the requirements of the Treasury Department
Mimeograph No. 5717, 1944 C.B. 321. In the event that it should be
determined by federal statute or by ruling of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue that the provisions of this section are no longer
necessary to qualify this plan under the Internal Revenue Code, this
section shall be ineffective without the necessity of further amendment.
(1) Anything contained in this plan to the contrary notwithstanding,
during the first 10 years after the effective date of this agreement,
the benefits provided by the Town's contributions to the trust for
the 25 highest paid employees of the Town as of the time of
establishment of the trust, including any such high-paid employees
who are not participants at such time but may later become
participants but excluding any employees whose annual benefit
provided by the Town will not exceed $1,500, will be subject to the
following conditions:
(a) If the plan is terminated or the full current costs thereof have not
been met at any time within 10 years after its establishment, the
funds or benefits which any of such 25 employees may receive
from Town contributions (including any unrestricted benefits,
as hereinafter defined, but exclusive of any supplemental
retirement income payments he has already received up to that
time) shall not exceed his unrestricted benefits at that time.
(b) If any such employee leaves the employ of the Town or withdraws
from participation in the plan when the full current costs have
not been met, the funds or benefits which he may receive from
Town contributions (including any funds or benefits he has
already received) shall not, at any time within the first 10 years
after establishment of the plan, exceed his unrestricted benefits
at that time.
B. These conditions shall not restrict the full payment of any death or
survivor's benefits on behalf of a participant who dies while the plan is
in full effect and its full current costs have been met.
C. The foregoing conditions do not restrict the current payment of full
retirement income benefits called for by the plan for a retired participant
while the plan is in full effect and its full current costs have been met.
D. "Unrestricted benefits" mean, at any time, benefits of the form called
for by this plan, including any withdrawal values available to a living
employee and any death or survivor's benefits payable on behalf of a
participant who dies after retirement, which have been provided by
contributions of the Town not exceeding the larger of the following
amounts:
(1) Twenty thousand dollars; or
§ 54-32 CROMWELL CODE § 54-33
1:44
(2) An amount equal to 20% of the first $50,000 of the employee's
average regular annual compensation multiplied by the number of
years since establishment of this plan.
E. "Supplemental retirement income payments" mean any current
payments to a retired participant sufficient, together with his
unrestricted benefits, to bring the total current payments to him up to
the full retirement income benefits provided under the trust.
F. If and when the contributions by the Town are sufficient at a later date
to meet the full current costs of the plan, the excess of the retirement
income payments otherwise payable over the actual retirement income
payments made during the period that such full current costs have not
been met shall be paid in a lump sum to the retired participant or, if
such participant has died in the meantime, to the beneficiaries of such
participant.

ARTICLE XI
Trustee
§ 54-34. Designation. [Amended BOS 11-13-2002]
All contributions by the Town and the participants shall be committed in
trust to a trustee appointed by the Board and pursuant to a trust agreement
approved by the Board. The trustee shall have such power, rights and duties
as may be specified in the trust agreement. The Board may from time to
time appoint and remove, pursuant to an agreement approved by the Board,
one or more investment managers who shall have such authority to direct
investments to be made by the trustee, with respect to all or part of the
assets of the trust fund, as may be specified in the agreement appointing
the investment manager. The Board shall promptly notify the trustee of
such appointment and of the terms, conditions, and any limitations of the
investment manager's power to direct investments.

ARTICLE XII
General Provisions
§ 54-35. Trust to be for benefit of employees exclusively.
This plan and the trust provided for hereunder are created for the exclusive
benefit of employees of the Town. Under no circumstances, except as
provided for in Article XIII hereof, either in the event of the termination or
amendment of the plan or otherwise, shall the trust fund or any part of the
corpus, income or avails thereof be used for or diverted to purposes other
than the exclusive benefit of participants, retired participants, terminated
participants, contingent annuitants and beneficiaries, except after
satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan, in which case any remaining
assets shall be paid over to the Town, provided that the trustee's reasonable
fees and expenses for operating and/or terminating the trust after
termination of the plan shall be paid from the trust fund.
§ 54-36. Amendments to plan.
The Town shall have the right, by action at a Town Meeting, to amend
the plan in whole or in part at any time and from time to time, provided
that no such amendment shall divert any part of the trust fund (remaining
after the payment of all costs and expenses properly chargeable thereto)
to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the employees at any time
prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the
plan and trust. Any such amendment may be retroactive in its operation.
No amendment shall be made which would affect the trustee without the
trustee's written consent thereto. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Board shall have the power to amend this plan without
further action by the Town to the extent that any amendments may be
required by the Internal Revenue Service as a condition to the qualification
of this plan under the Internal Revenue Code.
§ 54-37. Plan does not create any contract of employment.
This plan shall not be construed as creating any contract of employment
between the Town and any employee, and the Town shall have the right
in all respects to deal with its employees, their hiring, discharge,
compensation and conditions of employment as though this plan did not
exist. No employee shall have any right to question the action of the Town
in terminating its contributions to the trust or in terminating the plan in its
entirety.
§ 54-38. Benefits not subject to encumbrances.
The trust fund is established for the purpose of providing for the support of
persons who are to receive benefits under the plan. No benefit payable at
any time under the plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale,
transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment or encumbrance of
any kind. Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise
§ 54-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 54-38
1:49
encumber any such benefits, whether presently or thereafter payable, shall
be void.
§ 54-39. Reliance on documents deemed to be legitimate.
The Town, the Board and the trustee shall be discharged from all liability in
acting upon any notice, request, consent, letter, telegram or other paper or
document believed by them to be genuine and to have been signed or sent
by the proper person.
§ 54-40. Payments to persons deemed to be incapable of receipt.
If the Board shall determine that any person entitled to benefits of any form
under the plan is legally, physically or mentally incapable of receiving and
receipting for the payment of such benefits, then the Board may direct the
trustee to make such payments or any part thereof to such other person,
persons or institutions as the Board believes are then maintaining or have
custody of such recipient, until claim for such payment is made by his or
her duly appointed conservator or other legal representative. Such payment
shall constitute a complete discharge of the liability of the trustee to the
extent thereof.
§ 54-41. Minimum payments.
If any payments due hereunder shall amount to less than $20 a month, the
Board may direct that such payments be made less frequently in such a
manner that each payment will amount to at least $20.
§ 54-42. Titles and headings not part of plan.
The titles of the various articles and sections of this chapter are inserted
herein solely for convenience of reference, do not constitute a part of the
plan and shall be disregarded in construing, interpreting or applying any or
all of the provisions hereof.

ARTICLE XIII
Revocability
§ 54-43. Revocation upon failure to meet federal requirement.
This plan and the trust created in connection with the plan are based upon
the condition precedent that they shall be approved and qualified by the
International Revenue Service as meeting the requirements of the Federal
Internal Revenue Code and regulations issued thereunder with respect to
employees' trusts, so that the Town's contributions will not be currently
taxable to the participants as income. Accordingly, anything hereinabove
contained to the contrary notwithstanding, if a final ruling shall be received,
in writing, from the Internal Revenue Service that this plan and the trust
do not qualify under the terms of Sections 401 and 501 of the Internal
Revenue Code, there shall be no vesting in any participant of any assets of
the trust fund held by the trustee, and the trustee, upon receipt of written
notice from the Board, together with a copy of such a ruling, shall transfer
and pay over to the Town all of the net assets in the trust fund remaining
after deduction of proper expenses of termination, and the trust fund shall
thereupon terminate. For the purposes of this article, "final ruling" shall
mean either the initial letter ruling from the District Director, in response
to the Town's original application for a ruling, or, if such letter ruling is
unfavorable and a written appeal is taken or protest filed with 60 days of
the date of such letter ruling, it shall mean the ruling received in response
to such appeal or protest.

ADULT-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS
CHARTER REVISION
Effective with the general election held in
November 2013, the Town changed to a Town
Council/Town Manager form of government.
According to Charter § 11.04, any references
in Town ordinances to the "First Selectman"
or to the "Board of Selectmen" shall now be
deemed to refer to the "Town Manager" or the
"Town Council," as appropriate.

Zoning  See Ch. 236.
§ 71-1. Findings and purpose. [Amended TC 6-16-2014]
The Town Council of the Town of Cromwell, Connecticut, finds:
A. There are or may in the future be adult-oriented establishments located
in the Town of Cromwell which require special supervision from the
Town's public safety agencies in order to protect and preserve the
health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishments as well
as the health, safety and welfare of the Town's citizens.
B. Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and
towns in the United States indicate that:
(1) Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such adultoriented
establishments, especially those which provide closed
booths, cubicles, studies and rooms for the private viewing of socalled
adult motion pictures and/or videotapes and/or live
entertainment.
(2) Persons under the age of 18 may be attracted to adult-oriented
establishments and seek to enter or loiter about them without the
knowledge or permission of their parents or guardians.
(3) Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by
patrons, clients or customers of such adult-oriented establishments
for the purpose of engaging in certain sexual acts.
(4) Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such
establishments in order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients
or customers of such establishments within such booths, cubicles
and rooms.
(5) Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the
entrances and/or exits of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms
which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are
in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and
rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes or others,
thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the commission
§ 63-13 CROMWELL CODE § 71-1
1:62
of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and urine to be deposited on
the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms,
which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of
other persons who may come into contact with such deposits.
(6) The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented
establishments tends to discourage such sexual acts and prostitution
and thereby promotes the health, safety and welfare of the patrons,
clients and customers of such establishments.
(7) The nature of adult-oriented establishments and the traffic which
they generate and the potential and the propensity for such
establishments to attract persons interested in explicit sexual
activities or erotic art forms and the potential for outdoor assembly
of such persons around the premises of such establishments are
such as to make them incompatible with nearby uses of land where
concentrations of children or youth tend to congregate.
C. The continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments,
including without limitations those specifically cited in Subsection A
hereof, is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and
safety of the citizens of Cromwell.
D. The Constitution and laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the
Town powers, especially police power, to enact reasonable legislation
and measures to regulate and supervise adult-oriented establishments
as hereinafter defined in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
E. It is not the intent of the Town Council, in enacting this chapter, to
deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States
and/or State Constitutions nor is it the intent of the Town Council to
impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents or any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes,
books and/or other materials. Further, by enacting this chapter, the Town
Council does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to
obtain and/or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the
United States and/or State Constitutions nor does it intend to restrict or
deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors
of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit
such materials. [Amended TC 6-16-2014]

accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The Chief
of Police may proscribe such protection as deems necessary to allow for the
safe passage of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, including requiring police
officers or flaggers, whenever there are road closings, lane closings or other
restrictions to traffic. Only 1/2 of the traveled portion of a street or highway

12 inches in depth after compaction. No muck, clay, frozen earth, topsoil,
stones over six inches in any dimension or other deleterious material
shall be placed in excavation, but shall be disposed of as indicated
above. The approved backfill material shall be placed and compacted
at a moisture content between 4% and 6% (based on dry density, by
weight), or within 2% of the optimum moisture content as determined by
the moisture-density relationship test specified in American Society For
Testing And Materials, AD1557.
B. At locations where the contractor elects to consolidate the backfill
material by the so-called "Ho-Pac" method, the compacted layers shall
not exceed four feet in depth after compaction. The vibratory compactor
shall be placed directly on the backfill surface, and the compaction effort
shall continue until no further visible settlement occurs.
§ 125-11. Restoring pavement.

shall be removed and replaced with new aggregate base if needed, and
permanent bituminous material as indicated below:
(1) One and one-half inches of bituminous concrete surface course on
two inches of bituminous concrete binder course.

also be in conformance with Form 817 or the latest revision. After
the removal of the temporary patch and prior to the placement of the
permanent bituminous material, the existing pavement will be cut back
as directed by the Director of Public Works or his authorized
representative to create vertical faces which will either be by Public
Works construction permit ordinance parallel or perpendicular to the
new pavement. The vertical faces will be sealed with 85/100 asphaltic
material to ensure a good bond between the old and new pavement
material. The surface of the repaved excavation shall be flush with
§ 125-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 125-11
1:105
the adjacent pavement. All excavations shall be properly protected by
barricades and warning lights furnished and maintained by the
contractor during the curing period. Curbs and sidewalks are considered
a part of the pavement and are to be restored to their original condition
in accordance with applicable Town standards and specifications. All
grassed areas or open areas are to be rough graded with boulders
larger than six inches removed from the site. All lawned areas are to be
fine graded with four inches of topsoil and seeded as approved by the
Director of Public Works. All other highway facilities, signs, pavement
markings, sewers or subsurface structures shall be restored to their
original condition before excavation was made
§ 125-12. Maintenance of patches; repair by Town.
A. The contractor shall be responsible for the maintenance of the repaired
patch during the life of the temporary patch and for a period of one
year after the acceptance of the permanent patch by the Director of
Public Works. In the event that it is necessary to make repairs to the
excavation or restoration of the pavement during the one-year period,
said guarantee shall extend for an additional period of sixty days. The
performance bond shall include said conditions of maintenance within its
provisions.
B. Any patches not satisfactorily maintained by the contractor may be
repaired by the Town of Cromwell, and the following charges shall be
billed to the person, firm, or corporation responsible for the patch: $150
per repair on weekdays and $250 per repair on weekends and holidays.
No further permits shall be issued to the person, firm, or corporation so
billed until the balance owed the Town is paid. All remittances shall be
payable to the Treasurer of the Town of Cromwell.

written notice to the license holder by means of an inspection report or
notice of violation.

investigator finds that the violation(s) has not been corrected, an
inspection fee of $75 shall be paid and collected for each such
reinspection required.

a copy of said order upon the inner surface of a glass panel facing

said order, and the license holder and those having notice of said order
shall hold the Town of Cromwell blameless.

Nonresidential Property
[Adopted BOS 7-9-1997]
§ 162-1. Findings and declaration of policy.
It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Town of Cromwell
structures used for nonresidential purposes which are, or may become
in the future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment and
maintenance; or further that such conditions including but not limited to
structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, lack of essential heating,
plumbing, storage or refrigeration equipment, lack of maintenance or
upkeep of essential utilities and facilities, existence of fire hazards,
inadequate provisions for light and air, unsanitary conditions and
overcrowding constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare and
reasonable comfort of the citizens and inhabitants of the Town of Cromwell.
It is further found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance
and progressive deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are
not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid condition will grow and spread and
will necessitate in time the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to
correct and eliminate the same, and that by reasons of timely regulations
and restrictions as herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be
prevented and the neighborhood and property values thereby maintained,
the desirability and amenities of nonresidential uses and adjacent or nearby
residential neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and
welfare protected and fostered. It is further found that many vacant or
blighted buildings can be repaired or rehabilitated and reused so as to
provide decent, safe and sanitary commercial facilities and hence to become
productive properties for the owners and a source of property taxes for the
Town.
§ 162-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, morals and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance,
appearance, condition and occupancy of nonresidential premises; to
establish minimum standards governing utilities, facilities and other
physical components and conditions essential to make the aforesaid
facilities fit for human habitation, occupancy and use; to fix certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators and distinct and
separate responsibilities and duties upon occupants; to authorize and
establish procedures for the inspection of premises; to fix penalties for the
violations of this article; and to provide for the repair, demolition or vacation
of premises unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use. This article is
hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public interest, and it
is intended that this article be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes
as stated herein.

closed or protected during construction and during periods when work
on any incomplete job is suspended.

abandonment and of the closing and sealing of such drain and its
representative afforded an opportunity to see such work performed. All
of said work shall be done by the person or party that demolishes the
building or structure or who alters such system so as to make such
closing and sealing necessary and, in the failure of such person or party
to do so, shall be done by the owner, lessee or tenant of the premises to
the satisfaction of the Sewer Authority, all without expense to the Town.
[Amended TC 6-16-2014]
§ 193-6. Control of discharges.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater,
surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage,
uncontaminated cooling water or uncontaminated industrial process
waters to any sanitary sewer.
B. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any substance
prohibited by the charter, ordinances, rules and regulations adopted by
the Mattabassett District or any other substances which in the opinion
of the Sewer Authority are likely to harm the sewers, sewage treatment
process or equipment or have an adverse effect on the receiving stream
or can otherwise endanger life, limb or public property or constitute a
nuisance.
C. If any waters and wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain substances
referenced in Subsection B of this section, the Sewer Authority may:
(1) Reject the wastes;
§ 193-5 CROMWELL CODE § 193-6
1:204
(2) Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
(4) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes.
D. If the Sewer Authority permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be
subject to review and approval by the Sewer Authority and subject
to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, laws and the
municipal discharge permit. Further, such pretreatment installations
must be consistent with the requirements of any Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection42 pretreatment permit issued
to the industry.
E. Grease, oil and sand traps shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
Sewer Authority, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes
and/or other harmful ingredients, except that such traps shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All traps shall be
of a type and capacity approved by the Sewer Authority and shall be
located so as to be readily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
F. Where preliminary pretreatment or flow equalization facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously
in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
G. When required by the Sewer Authority, the owner of any property
serviced by a house connection carrying industrial waste shall install
a suitable control manhole, together with such meters and other
appurtenances in the house connection to facilitate observation
sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when
required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed
with plans approved by the Sewer Authority. The manhole shall be
installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible at all times. All industries discharging
into a public sewer shall perform such monitoring of their discharge as
the Sewer Authority and/or other duly authorized employees of the Town
may reasonably require, including installation, use and maintenance of
monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting results of such
monitoring to the Sewer Authority. Such records shall be made available
upon request by the Sewer Authority to other agencies having
jurisdiction over discharges to the receiving waters.
H. All measurements, tests and analysis of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined
in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Waste Water, published by the American
Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control
manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the
control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
42.Editor's Note: Now the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
§ 193-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-6
1:205
manhole in the public sewer at which the house connection is connected.
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all
outfalls of the premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or
samples should be taken.
I. Any industry held in violation of the provisions of this article may have
its disposal authorization terminated.
J. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the Town and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength
or character may be accepted by the Town for treatment, subject to
payment therefor by the industrial concern, provided that such
agreements do not contravene any requirements of federal laws and are
compatible with any user change and industrial cost recovery system in
effect.
§ 193-7. Persons authorized to work on sewers; permits; fees.
A. To ensure compliance with the foregoing section of this article and
to facilitate the supervision of the construction, operation and repair
of sewers and keeping of records thereof, no person other than those
described in Subsection B shall construct, repair, alter or remove any
sewer or house connection connected to or with or discharging directly
or indirectly to or into any public sewer of said Town or intended to
discharge this at some future time, regardless of whether said work is

B. The following may, as indicated, construct, repair, alter or remove
sewers, subject to supervision and approval of the Sewer Authority or its
authorized agent:
(1) Regular forces of or a contractor employed by the Town of Cromwell

provided that no plumber or other person shall make any connection
to a public sewer of said Town without a permit therefor, even if said
sewer or drain is located under or immediately adjacent to any building
or similar structure, and provided that all drains and fixtures within said
buildings or similar structures and all use of them shall conform to the
requirements of this article as to what may or may not be permitted to
be discharged into public sewers.

43.Editor's Note: See Ch. 99, Building Construction.
§ 193-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-7
1:207
E. Each licensed drainlayer shall be responsible for the faithful
performance of all work performed under the permit issued to him and
for the conduct of all work and all materials furnished on work by his
employees or agents. No work shall be sublet by a licensed drainlayer
under any permit issued in any manner to divest said drainlayer in full
control and responsibility for all parts of said work. Only competent
men shall be employed on work performed under such permit, and only
suitable materials to the standards established by the Sewer Authority
shall be furnished or used on such work. Should the authorized
representative of the Sewer Authority find that any licensed drainlayer
has failed to conform to the requirements of this article and to the
conditions of any permit issued hereunder or that said drainlayer has
not been faithful in the performance of work or furnishing materials
under the permit, such representative may suspend such permit until
the next meeting of the Sewer Authority and shall report the matter to
such meeting. Such suspended drainlayer and any complainant in said
matter shall be notified of such meeting and afforded an opportunity to
be heard on the matter at that time. The Sewer Authority may, after said
opportunity to be heard has been provided, revoke said permit and/or
may extend the suspension of such permit for such period and/or limit
the activities of such drainlayer in such manner as may appear to be in
the public interest.
F. No person, other than those working for and under the direction of
the Town of Cromwell, shall make any excavation for or construct,
install, lay, repair, alter or remove any sewer or drain connection or
appurtenance thereof within the Town of Cromwell, which sewer or
drain connection or appurtenance thereof is in any way connected or
discharges directly or indirectly to or into any public sewer of said
Town or is intended to at some future time to be so connected or so
discharge, until said person or party shall have applied for and secured
from the Sewer Authority or its authorized representative a property
owner's permit for doing such work. Such permits may be issued only to
those qualified to perform such work, as provided in Subsection B of this
section.
(1) The Sewer Authority may authorize competent representatives to act
for it in receiving applications for permits.
(2) Every application for a permit shall be made in writing on forms as
provided by the Sewer Authority for that purpose and shall be signed
by the licensed drainlayer or other qualified person or party or an
authorized agent thereof. The application shall state the location and
ownership of the property to be served by the sewer in question, the
post office address of said property owner and a brief description
of the work to be done and shall contain an agreement that the
permittee shall do the work in accordance with the requirements
of the Sewer Authority of the Town of Cromwell and local laws,
ordinances and regulations and permits as those laws, ordinances
and regulations may apply to the particular location or work and will
save said Town and others harmless from damages, loss, damage
claims, etc., in accordance with the drainlayer's surety bond
§ 193-7 CROMWELL CODE § 193-7
1:208
provided for in § 193-8 hereof, all in such form and detail as may be
directed by the Town in the form provided. When the proposed sewer
work is within the limits of any state highway or any Town highway,
the drainlayer shall present the required permit for excavation from
the Connecticut Department of Transportation or from the Director
of Public Works of the Town of Cromwell, respectively, before the
permit will be issued. No person shall be permitted to receive the
permit other than the licensed drainlayer, who shall sign the permit
in the presence of an authorized agent of the Sewer Authority. In
signing the application and permit, the drainlayer agrees to install
all devices or other equipment necessary to prevent any substances
prohibited from entering the public sewer to do so. Signing of the
permit also indicates the drainlayer's agreement to install and use all
devices or other equipment necessary to prevent injury to any person
or property as a result of the work for which the permit was issued.
(3) All completed applications for permits and a record of the work
performed under every permit issued thereupon shall be kept as
permanent records of the Sewer Authority of the Town of Cromwell.
(4) Each permit to construct, alter or repair any sewer or house
connection under this section shall be issued only after an
application, as herein provided, has been made. It shall state the
location and character of the work to be performed thereunder; the
person granted permission to perform such work; and a time limit
within which the work must be performed and at the expiration
of which the privileges for construction under the permit shall
terminate, unless such time limits shall have been extended in
writing by the Sewer Authority or its authorized representative,
and shall indicate the general character of the wastes which may
be discharged into the sewer in question and any other pertinent
information or conditions. Permits shall not be transferable or
assignable by the permittee.
(5) Permits shall be kept on the premises at all times where work is
in progress and shall be shown to any proper person asking to see
the same. All persons operating under such permits shall be held
responsible for conformity with the requirements thereof and of this
article.
(6) Any permit may be suspended, canceled or terminated by the Sewer
Authority or its authorized representative on written notice to the
permittee for violation of the conditions thereof or for violation of
the conditions of this article or of the standards and specifications
established by the Sewer Authority for such work as provided by
this article and for other reasons of public interest. Suspension,
cancellation or termination of a permit shall not entitle the permittee
to any compensation or reimbursement from the Town or its agents
for any alleged loss or expense incurred thereby, and permits shall
only be issued on this condition.
(7) In the case of a proposed sewer connection from an industrial
building, commercial building, commercial complex or residential
subdivision or any building other than a normal residential building,
§ 193-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-7
1:209
the Town shall be provided with a suitable plan and the proposed
method of connection to the public sewer. Such plan shall be
submitted to the Town prior to the time when the permit is needed to
allow the Town sufficient time to investigate properly the proposed
design of connection and to make any recommendation it may deem
advisable. The developer shall furnish the Sewer Authority a
complete set of construction drawings prepared by and bearing
the signature and seal of a professional engineer licensed by the
State of Connecticut. Said plans shall comply with the requirements
established by the Sewer Authority.
(8) Fees for the permits, as outlined herein, shall be established from
time to time by the Sewer Authority. Initially they shall be:
(a) Residential: $25.
(b) Drainlayer: $25.
§ 193-8. Insurance and bonds.
A. Every drainlayer making application for a permit shall be protected by
and pay premiums on policies of insurance coverage for public liability
and bodily injury, insuring him against liability to persons not in his
employ, in the minimum amount of $300,000 for each occurrence, or
in a greater amount when so required by the Sewer Authority. Said
insurance policies shall be issued by an insurance company licensed to
issue such policies by the State of Connecticut. All insurance policies
shall name the Town of Cromwell, the Cromwell Water Pollution Control
Authority, their employees and agents as assureds. Special coverage for
blasting or other circumstances determined by the Sewer Authority to
cause increased risk to the general public or property, whether private
or public, shall be provided by the drainlayer in the amount established
by the Sewer Authority prior to the commencement of any work or
the issuance of any permit. The drainlayer shall also carry workman's
compensation insurance in the amounts specified by the General
Statutes of the State of Connecticut and shall provide the Sewer
Authority with proof of such coverage when applying for a permit to
work on sanitary sewers within the Town of Cromwell. It shall be the
responsibility of the drainlayer to provide the Sewer Authority with
insurance certificates for the above described insurance requirements
prior to the commencement of any work relating to the sanitary system
of the Town of Cromwell. The drainlayer may use forms describing the
above requirements provided by the Town or forms acceptable to the
Sewer Authority provided by the insuring company.
B. Every drainlayer making application for a permit shall provide the Sewer
Authority with a performance bond in the amount specified by the Sewer
Authority, which shall not be less than $5,000. The performance bond
may be posted in either of one or a combination of the following ways:
(1) A surety bond issued by a surety company licensed to issue such
bonds within the State of Connecticut.
(2) A letter of credit prepared on the issuing bank's stationery and
signed by an officer of said bank.
(3) A cash bond, the forms for which shall be provided by the Town.
§ 193-7 CROMWELL CODE § 193-8
1:210
C. Upon receipt of any bond by the Authority, it shall be placed in the
custody of the Treasurer of the Town of Cromwell to be held until
released by the Sewer Authority. The Treasurer shall promptly deposit
any cash bond in a local bank and, upon written request of the depositor
of said cash bond, may from time to time release to said depositor any
interest earnings earned by the deposit of said bond. Upon release of
such earnings, the Treasurer shall notify the Sewer Authority, in writing,
of such action.
D. The bond and insurance, in combination, shall provide that the Town
of Cromwell, the Cromwell Water Pollution Control Authority, the State
of Connecticut and their respective employees and agents shall be
indemnified and saved harmless from all suits of every name and
description brought against any of said bodies or their agents or
employees for or on account of any injuries or damages received or
sustained by any person or property in consequence of or resulting
from any work performed by the drainlayer, his agents or employees
or from any act or omission of the drainlayer, his agents or employees
while operating under the permit applied for or from any negligence
regarding such work; that the drainlayer shall reimburse the Town for
any expense to said Town or its agents or employees arising from any
injury or damage to any sewer or other property of said Town or by
reason of any violation by the drainlayer or his agents or employees
of any requirement of this article; that the drainlayer shall faithfully
execute in all respects all work performed under the permit proposed
to be issued; that the drainlayer shall restore the portion of any street
or public place in which the drainlayer may have made an excavation
incidental to work under said permit to the same condition as it was
in prior to said work and also shall keep said street or public place in
such condition as is acceptable by the public official in charge of such
street or place for a period of two years from the date of completion
of said restoration; that the drainlayer shall reimburse the Town or the
state for the expense of repairs to such street or public place made
necessary by reason of the excavation made by the drainlayer; and that
the drainlayer shall comply in all respects with the rules and regulations,
laws, ordinances, etc., relative to work in such streets or public places
and with the terms of the permits which may be issued to the drainlayer.
§ 193-9. Violations and penalties.
A. If any person shall construct, install, alter or repair any sewer,
appurtenance or connection to any public sewer of the Town of Cromwell
in violation of the requirements of this article or, having obtained a
permit as provided by this article, shall construct, install, alter or repair
a sewer, appurtenance or connection thereto without having given the
Sewer Authority or its authorized representative ample notice, time,
opportunity and assistance during regular working hours to inspect such
sewer, appurtenance or connection and the work and materials used
thereon, said Sewer Authority or its authorized representative may, in
its or his discretion, order or direct the person who performed such
work on said sewer, appurtenance or connection, etc., and the owner
§ 193-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-9
1:211
of any property in which said sewer, etc., may be located, or which
may be served thereby or in whose interest and employ said work
was done, to uncover and fully expose any and all portions of said
sewer, appurtenance or connection and afford said inspector adequate
opportunity to examine and inspect such sewer, etc., and to secure such
records thereof as may be proper. If such sewer or connection and
any appurtenance thereof shall be found not to be in full accord with
the requirements of this article and the standards established under its
provisions, then said Sewer Authority or its authorized representative
may order the person, owner or lessee to make changes in or additions
to or remove portions of appurtenances of such sewer, etc., as may
be necessary to ensure that such sewer, etc., will conform to the
requirements of this article and the standards established under its
provisions. All of such work shall be performed by said person, owner or
lessee without delay and without expense to the Town of Cromwell.
B. If the Sewer Authority shall have evidence that a sewer or any part
or appurtenance thereof, which is connected to or discharges into any
public sewer of the Town of Cromwell, has been constructed, repaired or
altered or is or has been used, operated or maintained or substances are
being or have recently been discharged through the same in violation
of the requirements of this article or of the standards established under
its provisions, said Sewer Authority shall inquire into the matter. Said
Sewer Authority may require that the owner, lessee or tenant of the
property where such sewer, etc., may be located or of the property
served by such sewer, etc., assist said Sewer Authority and its
representatives in such inquiry and permit them to examine such sewer,
etc., and observe the manner in which the sewer, etc., is used, operated
or maintained and the wastes discharged into the same. If the Sewer
Authority shall find on such inquiry that there exists good reason to
believe that the requirements of this article have not been or are not
being complied with, they may require the owner, lessee or tenant of said
property to furnish the Sewer Authority with adequate proof that said
requirements are being conformed to and will continue to be complied
with. If it shall appear that said requirements have not been and are
not being conformed to or complied with or that good reason exists to
believe that they may not thereafter be conformed to or complied with,
said Sewer Authority may order and require that the owner, lessee or
tenant shall immediately take such measures or provide and install such
appurtenances to make such changes in such sewer, etc., or manner of
using or maintaining the same that will ensure that said requirements
will be conformed to or complied with thereafter. All assistance, proof,
changes and new appurtenances required by this section to be furnished
or provided by the owner, lessee or tenant in question shall be promptly
furnished by said owner, lessee or tenant without expense to the Town of
Cromwell.
C. If any person, after an order or direction from the Sewer Authority of the
Town of Cromwell, fails to take the remedial steps or perform the acts
required under Subsections A and B of this section or fails thereafter to
use, operate and maintain any connection with the public sewers of the
§ 193-9 CROMWELL CODE § 193-9
1:212
Town or appurtenances thereof, as required by this article, the Sewer
Authority, by such agents as it may choose, may disconnect the house
connection that was wrongfully connected, altered, repaired or used or
through which improper wastes were being discharged into the public
sewer system of the Town. In disconnecting said house connections, the
Sewer Authority may interfere with or cut off sewage from other portions
of the property whereon such violation of this article has occurred or of
any adjacent property which is served by such house connection.
D. If the Sewer Authority shall have disconnected a house connection from
the public sewer system, as above provided, said Sewer Authority may
collect the cost of making such disconnection from any person
responsible for or willfully concerned in or who profited by such violation
of this article.
E. If the Sewer Authority has disconnected any property from the public
sewer system, as above provided, it may thereafter refuse to permit the
restoration of the former connection or of any new connection concerned
in the violation of this article until the claim of the Authority of the cost of
making such disconnection shall have been paid in full, plus interest and
the reasonable overhead of any legal expense incurred by the Authority
in connection therewith.
F. Any person violating any provision of this article may be proceeded
against and fined not exceeding $1,000 for each offense, and, for the
purposes of this article, each day that a violation of this article is
permitted to continue shall be considered as a separate offense.
§ 193-10. Powers and authority of inspectors.
A. The Sewer Authority and other duly authorized employees of the Town
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter
all properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling and testing, in accordance with the provisions of this article.
The Sewer Authority or its representative shall have no authority to
inquire into any processes, including metallurgical, chemical, oil,
refining, ceramic, paper or other industries, beyond that point that has
a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers or
waterways or facilities for wastes treatment.
B. While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in
Subsection A above, the Sewer Authority or duly authorized employees
of the Town shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the company and all applicable safety rules established
by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The company
shall be held harmless for injury or death to the Town employees and
against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property
damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging
and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or
failure of the company to maintain safe conditions, as required in § 193-6
of this article.
C. The Sewer Authority and any other duly authorized employees of the
Town bearing proper identification and credentials shall be permitted
to enter all properties through which the Town has a duly negotiated
§ 193-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-10
1:213
easement for the purpose of but not limited to inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of the
sewer works, lying within said easement. All entry and subsequent work,
if any, on said easement shall be done in full accordance with the
terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property
involved.

ARTICLE II
Connections by Developers
§ 193-11. Agreements with developers to build sewers.
A. The Sewer Authority is authorized to enter into agreements on behalf
of the Town of Cromwell with developers, other owners of land or their
agents for the construction of sewers by and at the expense of such
developers, owners or agents in which said sewers may become part of
the public sewer system of the Town of Cromwell under the conditions
hereinafter stipulated, and the Authority is hereby empowered to make
from time to time any regulations stipulating the terms and conditions
of said agreement not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this
article and applicable Connecticut General Statutes.
B. The duly elected Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Sewer Authority is
authorized to sign said agreements on behalf of the Town of Cromwell
when authorized by a majority vote of said Authority.
C. The terms and text of a standard form of agreement for use under the
authority of this article and any variations from said standard agreement
shall be approved by the Authority's attorney.
D. The Authority shall specify in the terms of such agreements or on plans
to be made part of said agreement the limits, sizes and gradient of the
sewers to be constructed and the nature of and any limitations on the
sanitary sewage or industrial wastes to be conveyed by said sewer. All
the terms of and all subsequent amendments to an ordinance entitled
"An Ordinance of the Town of Cromwell Regulating the Construction
of, Use of, Discharge of Substances Into and Connections to the Public
Sewers of the Town of Cromwell and the Installation of Pipes and
Fixtures Intended to Discharge Wastes Into Said Sewers"44 shall be
applicable to all work done under such agreements.
E. All such agreements shall provide that the full cost of design,
construction or other incidental cost thereto shall be borne by the
developer, owner or agent. The developer, owner or agent shall, prior to
commencement of any work on the proposed sewer or appurtenances,
deposit with the Treasurer of the Town a sum of money determined by
the Authority to be sufficient to defray any cost the Town may incur for
inspection, review, engineering, testing or other costs relative to said
project prior to, after or during the construction of said sewer referred
to in said agreement. Said agreement shall contain the provision that if
at any time during the life of said agreement the aforementioned deposit
proves to be insufficient, the developer shall, upon notification by the
Authority, make such additional deposits as required with the Treasurer
of the Town. Upon acceptance of the sewer into the public sewer system,
the unexpended portion of the deposits will be returned to the developer
or owner.
F. All such agreements shall provide that the developer or owner shall
assume all risks and hold the Town of Cromwell, its agents and
employees harmless for any and all claims for damage arising from the
44.Editor's Note: Said ordinance, adopted 12-29-1969, as amended, was repealed 11-14-1990.

work or its conduct. To secure such risks, adequate liability, property
damage and compensation insurance in the amounts determined by
the Sewer Authority shall be required from the developer or owner.
Said developer or owner shall furnish the Authority with proper and
acceptable certificates of insurance issued by an insurance company
licensed to do so by the State of Connecticut. Said certificates of
insurance shall provide for continuous renewal until released by the
Authority.
G. All such agreements shall require that the developer or owner shall
deposit with the Treasurer of the Town a performance and maintenance
bond in the amounts specified by the Sewer Authority in a form
acceptable to the Sewer Authority. The term of said bond shall be
established by the Sewer Authority and shall provide for continuous
renewal until released by the Sewer Authority. In the event that a cash
bond is accepted by the Authority, said cash deposit shall be deposited
by the Treasurer of the Town in a local bank or banks in an interestbearing
account. Upon release of said cash bond, all earnings on the
deposit of said bond shall become the property of the developer or
owner having posted said bond. During the period that the bond is being
held, the depositor may request and the Treasurer may allow that the
interest earnings on said deposit may be withdrawn from time to time.
The Treasurer shall, upon releasing such earnings, notify the Sewer
Authority in writing.
H. All such agreements shall require that whenever the proposed sewer is
not in a public highway, adequate rights-of-way shall be conveyed to the
Town of Cromwell. The terms of said conveyance shall be approved by
the Town Attorney and shall be conveyed prior to the acceptance of the
sewer by the Sewer Authority.
I. After such sewer system has been constructed under the terms of said
agreement and the Sewer Authority is of the opinion that said sewer was
constructed in conformance with the plans and specifications and said
sewer conforms to the requirements of the standards established by said
Authority and the maintenance period set forth in said agreement has
expired and all restoration to public or private property disturbed during
the construction of said sewer has been completed or adequate bond
has been provided to assure that any corrective measures necessary
during such maintenance period will be done without cost to the Town,
the Sewer Authority may, by resolution, incorporate said sewer into the
public sewer system of the Town of Cromwell.

ARTICLE III
Sewers in Subdivisions
§ 193-12. Sewer Authority approval or waiver required; benefit
assessment.
A. When an owner or developer of a parcel of land within the Town of
Cromwell submits a plan of development for said parcel of land to
the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Cromwell, said
Commission shall not approve such plan of development until said
developer has secured from the Sewer Authority of the Town of
Cromwell an approval of his proposed sanitary sewer system and its
connection to the public sewer system of the Town or a waiver of
such requirement from said Sewer Authority as hereinafter provided in
Subsection B of this section.
B. If a proposed subdivision is located within 5,000 feet of an existing
public sewer system or within an area that the Sewer Authority expects
to extend public sewers into within a five-year period in accordance
with a master sewer plan established by the Sewer Authority or in an
area that is to be serviced by a sewer system that has been designed
but not constructed, the developer shall be required to connect his
proposed sewer system to said public sewer. If in the opinion of the
Sewer Authority such connection is impractical because of the location
of the proposed development in relation to the public sewer or because
the capacity of said public sewer cannot accommodate the projected
flow from such development, the Authority may, by resolution, waive said
requirement to connect to said public sewer. When the Authority is of
such opinion, it shall notify the developer that:
(1) He is released from the requirement to provide a public sewer
system for his proposed development;
(2) He shall be required to install a capped sewage system within the
proposed development and shall deposit with the Town a sum of
money determined by said Authority to be sufficient to connect said
capped system to the public sewer when it becomes practical to do
so; or
(3) He shall be required, as part of his proposed system, to construct
the sewer system the Town had designed but not built. When this
action is required of the developer, the Authority shall agree to
acquire any rights-of-way needed as part of its design, without cost
to the developer, and shall agree to reimburse the developer for
the additional cost of installing any pipes or other appurtenances
required which exceed either the capacity of the sewer system
needed to serve the proposed development or the minimum size
pipes and appurtenances established by the Sewer Authority for
sewer systems within the Town of Cromwell, whichever results in
larger size pipes and appurtenances thereto.
C. When topography indicates that construction of the proposed sewer
within the street line boundaries is impractical, the developer may
propose to install the sewer in rights-of-way off said street lines. If
the developer so proposes, the Sewer Authority is reserved the right
§ 193-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-12
1:217
to either accept or reject such proposal. If the Authority accepts such
proposal, the developer shall deed without cost to the Town all such
rights-of-way that cross over, under or upon any property owned by him
necessary to the construction and future maintenance of the proposed
sewer. [Amended TC 6-16-2014]
D. The Sewer Authority is authorized to enter into agreements with
developers allowing said developers to construct a sewer system that
will serve their proposed developments. Such agreements shall define
the conditions and responsibilities of both the Town and the developer
and shall be in a form as approved by the Town Attorney.
E. When topography dictates that a pumping station is needed to convey
effluent from the proposed development to the public sewage system,
the developer shall, at his own expense, install such pump station. If,
in reviewing the plans of the proposed development, the Authority finds
that areas beyond the limits of the proposed development could be
served by the aforesaid pump station, the Authority may require the
developer to include such area in the design capacity of the station,
without cost to the Town. If the design indicates that the pumps and
associated equipment needed to serve the enlarged areas will cause
additional cost to the developer, the Authority may negotiate with the
developer as to the distribution of the costs of such pumping station.
F. When the Town has constructed or caused to be constructed a sewer
to which the proposed sewage system designed to serve the proposed
development is connected or is to be connected, all improvements within
said development shall be subject to a benefit assessment. Said benefit
assessment shall be in accordance with the sewer assessment formula
established by the Sewer Authority now in effect or as revised by said
Authority and in effect at the time the benefit assessment is levied. Such
assessment and assessment formula shall conform to the requirements
of all General Statutes of the State of Connecticut and all applicable
sections of the Code of the Town of Cromwell.

ARTICLE IV
Interceptor Sewers
§ 193-13. Deferred assessments.
A. Purpose. In order to provide for the deferment of the costs of interceptor
sewers to such time or times as an extension of such interceptor shall be
designed, constructed and assessed to serve one or more sections of the
Town, this article is enacted by the Town of Cromwell, as provided by the
General Statutes of the State of Connecticut.
B. Excess costs.
(1) Whenever the Authority shall determine that the cost of an
interceptor sewer will exceed the benefit to the area to be sewered
immediately and directly and when such excess cost is due to
increased size or depth or to other costs which are necessary or
incidental in order that such sewer or sewer system of which it is a
part may be suitable for extension in the future to serve other areas
which could be served by such sewer or sewer system, the Authority
may elect to:
(a) Assess such excess costs as an outlet benefit in any area to
be served by the extensions of such sewer or sewer system
being designed and constructed, said assessment to be payable
at the same time as the assessment being levied against those
properties connecting immediately after the construction of the
sewer or sewer system is completed; or
(b) Pay such excess costs and defer the assessment of said excess
costs to properties not directly available to said sewer or sewer
system until such time as the sewer or sewer system is
immediately available to said property or properties.
(2) If the Authority shall elect to proceed under Subsection B(1)(b) of
this section and shall defer the assessment of the costs of outlet
benefits, owners of properties which are located in any area on
which such excess costs shall have been deferred shall be notified
of any proceedings instituted by the Authority for the actual
assessment of said excess costs upon such properties. No caveat or
lien shall be placed on the land records of the Town against any
property located in an area on which such excess costs have been
deferred until after the passage of a resolution by the Authority for
designing and constructing or extension of a sewer system into said
area which results in the sewer system's being then immediately
available to the aforesaid properties. Said deferred excess costs are
to be included as part of the assessments to be made because of such
extension against such properties.
C. Whenever the Authority shall determine that the cost of any sewer
for which a design is in progress or is planned for which a benefit
assessment is to be made shall include a portion of the cost of a sewer
previously constructed which was paid for, either in all or in part, by
the Town, said Authority shall determine the proportion of previously
deferred excess costs of such sewer which will benefit properties served
by the sewer being planned and shall include such costs in the cost
§ 193-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-13
1:219
of the sewer being designed, constructed or extended for the purpose
of determining the amount of the assessment to be levied against the
aforesaid properties; subject, however, to the rights of notice, hearing
appeal or such other right conveyed by this chapter or sections of the
General Statutes of the State of Connecticut as may be applicable.
D. Whenever a sewer is to be designed and constructed by a developer
or owner in any area in which excess sewer costs have been deferred
as hereinbefore provided, such deferred costs shall be assessed against
said developer or owner in the same manner and form as assessments
are applied against all other assessable properties.
E. Nothing herein contained shall in any way be construed to change,
abridge, amend or in any way interfere with the application of the
General Statutes in reference to local sewer authorities, their duties,
powers and responsibilities.

proper identification, access at all reasonable times to all parts of the
premises for the purpose of inspection, observation, records
examination, measurements, sampling and testing in accordance with
the provisions of this article. The refusal of any FPE to allow the
inspector official entry for purposes of inspection or performing such
other duties as shall be required shall constitute a violation of this
article. The CWPCA may pursue legal action as provided for in § 193-23
as may be advisable and reasonably necessary for inspectors to carry
out their duties.
F. Inspection. All FPEs shall be inspected as follows:

trap within 30 days of written notification by the CWPCA when any of the
following conditions exist:
(a) The establishment is found to be contributing grease, in quantities to cause
line stoppages, or increasing maintenance on the public sanitary sewer
system.
(b) The establishment does not have a grease trap.
(c) The establishment has an undersized, irreparable, or defective grease trap
(d) The existing establishment is sold or undergoes a change of ownership.
(e) Remodeling of a kitchen, which requires a plumbing permit to be issued by
the Town of Cromwell.
(f) The establishment has not operated as an FPE for one year prior to
receiving the FDP application form.
C. Variance from outdoor grease trap requirements. An AGRU may only be installed
when authorized by the CWPCA, in its sole discretion, after the FPE has sufficiently
demonstrated to the CWPCA that the installation of an outdoor grease trap would
not be feasible due to space constraints or other relevant considerations. The FPE
shall request a variance in writing, which shall contain the following information:
contact information, location of sewer main and easement; and existing plumbing
drawing, reason or circumstance that the variance is being requested.
D. Outdoor grease trap. Outdoor grease traps shall be installed in all FPEs except
where a variance was approved by the CWPCA as described in Subsection C. All
new and existing outdoor grease traps shall meet the following criteria:
(1) Trap design and location. Outdoor grease traps shall have a minimum of compartments and shall be capable of separation and retention of grease and storage
of settled solids. Access manholes with a minimum diameter of 24 inches shall provided over each trap chamber and sanitary tee. The manhole shall also have readily
removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling
activities. The invert elevation of the inlet shall be between three inches and six inches
above the invert elevation of the outlet. The trap shall be designed, constructed installed for adequate load-bearing capacity. Flow control devices shall be installed
where flow through the trap may exceed the manufacturer's flow ratings.
(2) Trap capacity. Minimum capacity of any one unit shall be 1,000 gallons as required a maximum of 1,500 gallons. Where sufficient capacity cannot be achieved with a single
unit, installation of grease traps in series is required. The CWPCA shall approve grease trap based on manufacturer's maximum flow capacity.
(3) Trap sizing. At a minimum, the trap shall hold discharges equivalent to maximum
flows over a twenty-four-hour period. The minimum volume trap shall be based on following calculations:
(a) Patron-based method.

Enzymes, solvents or emulsifiers shall not be used.
F. Other approved unit. If the permittee requests the use of a unit other than an
outdoor grease trap or an AGRU, the permittee must demonstrate to the CWPCA
that the proposed unit can reliably meet the effluent limitations established in
this article. Only after receiving approval by the CWPCA will the permittee be
authorized to install the proposed unit.
G. De minimis discharges. At the request of the permittee, the CWPCA may grant a
variance of the treatment requirements of this article, if, in the judgment of the
CWPCA, there is limited potential for grease in the discharge. This judgment shall
§ 193-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 193-20
1:229
be based on the frequency of operation; the volume of flow; and the potential for
grease, based upon the menu; and similar items. Any change to the conditions of
the variance must be reported to the CWPCA for review within 30 days.
§ 193-21. Fees and billing.
A. The fees provided for in this article are separate and distinct from all

Any denial or revocation of a permit pursuant to this article may be
appealed to the CWPCA. The permit applicant or permittee shall have 15
days from date of notification of the permit denial or revocation to submit
a written request for a hearing before the CWPCA. Failure to file an appeal
constitutes acceptance of the decision to deny or revoke the permit and any
conditions thereof. The CWPCA shall conduct a public hearing and decide
within 60 days from receipt of appeal, whether or not to grant the permit.
The decision of the CWPCA shall be final.
§ 193-23. Legal proceedings; violations and penalties.
A. Search warrant. The CWPCA, through the Town Attorney, may seek to
obtain a search warrant from the appropriate authority to gain access to
a FPE's facility for the purposes of verification of compliance inspection

than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any
illegal discharge to the storm drainage system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable
water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted
stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm
drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing
drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl
space pumps, air-conditioning condensation, springs,
noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or
wetland flows, swimming pools [if dechlorinated typically less than

source not containing pollutants.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the Town Manager as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a written
notification to the Town Manager prior to the time of the test. Said
written notification may be in the form of electronic mail, facsimile
transmission or hard copy letter format.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order
issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of
§ 200-4 CROMWELL CODE § 200-7
1:236
the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the
discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit,
waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and
provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge
to the storm drain system.
B. Illicit Connections Prohibited.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the storm drainage system, or
allows such a connection to continue.
§ 200-8. Suspension of (MS4) storm drainage system access.
A. Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Town
Manager may, without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health
or welfare of persons, or to the storm drainage system or waters of the
United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the Town Manager may take such steps as
deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the storm drainage
system or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of this chapter
may have his or her storm drainage system access terminated if such
termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Town
Manager will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its storm
drainage system access. The violator may petition the Town Manager for
reconsideration and hearing.
C. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates storm drainage
system access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without
the prior approval of the Town Manager.
§ 200-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Town Manager prior to the allowing of discharges to the
storm drainage system.
§ 200-10. Right of entry, evaluation, and monitoring of damages.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial or construction activity, and any
§ 200-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-10
1:237
other commercial or residential facilities that discharge stormwater to
the storm drainage system.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The Town Manager shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary
to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives or
designees of the Town Manager.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the Town Manager ready access to
all parts of the facility for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of a Town, state or federal NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
(3) The Town Manager shall have the right to install on any NPDES
permitted facilities such devices as are necessary in the opinion of
the Town Manager to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The Town Manager has the right to require the installation of
sampling and monitoring equipment on any NPDES permitted
facility by the discharger at its own expense. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Town
Manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town Manager access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with
a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial
activity commits an offense if the person denies the Town Manager
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
(7) If the Town Manager has been refused access to any part of the
facility from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation
of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample
as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to
verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the Town Manager may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 200-10 CROMWELL CODE § 200-10
1:238
(8) While performing the necessary work on private properties referred
to in Subsections B(1) through (5) of this section, the Town Manager
shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established
by the facility.
§ 200-11. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater
pollutants by the use of best management practices.
The Town Manager will adopt requirements identifying best management
practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials
or other wastes into the storm drainage system or watercourses through
the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or facility which is, or may be, the source of an
illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the storm drainage system as directed by the
Town Manager. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES
permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
or construction activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of
a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance
with requirements of the NPDES permit.
§ 200-12. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse,
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 200-13. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage
system, or water of the United States said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
§ 200-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 200-13
1:239
materials, said person shall notify the Town Manager in person or by phone,
electronic mail or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the Town Manager within three business days of the phone notice.
If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken
to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.
§ 200-14. Enforcement.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) Whenever the Town Manager finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, he/
she shall order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(b) The elimination of illicit discharges or connections;
(c) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;
(d) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property; and
(e) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property
are required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall

within the scope of his employment. Such written notice shall explain
the nature of the violation and the steps required for compliance,
and shall allow a seventy-two-hour period within which to correct
the violation or within which a written plan for correction shall be
submitted to the Town Manager, setting forth a reasonable time

up to $100 for each violation by hand, by certified return receipt
requested, by leaving a true and attested copy of the citation at the
usual place of abode or residence of the person in violation, or in
the case of a corporate or business entity, delivery to the business
address or the address of the statutory agent of said entity. No such
fine shall be levied against the state or any state official or state
employee acting within the scope of his employment. All citations

remittance of the fine.
C. Compliance periods after citation.
(1) Any violation for which a citation is issued and which is not corrected
within the time period specified in Subsection B of this section
shall be a new violation of this chapter, and every twenty-fourhour
period thereafter in which the violation is not corrected shall
constitute a new violation. The citation shall include a notice to the
alleged violator that each twenty-four-hour period of noncompliance
after the time period specified in § 200-14B shall constitute a new
violation and a new fine of up to $100.

appeal is not made within the ten-calendar-day period, the action of the
Town Manager is final.

[Adopted BOS 3-13-2007, effective 4-6-2007; amended in its
entirety TC 6-16-2014]
§ 211-18. Statutory authority; purpose.
The Town of Cromwell hereby enacts a tax deferral program for elderly
and disabled homeowners pursuant to Section 12-129n of the Connecticut
General Statutes for eligible residents of the Town of Cromwell on the terms
and conditions provided herein. The program is enacted for the purpose of
preventing eligible homeowners from having to sell or transfer their homes
as a result of tax liability. This program shall be known as the Cromwell
Senior and Disabled Tax Deferral Program."
§ 211-19. Eligibility.
An applicant shall meet the following criteria to be eligible for this program:
A. Taxpayer qualifications.
(1) Tax deferrals shall be granted in connection with real property
owned and occupied as a principal residence by taxpayers of the
Town of Cromwell who are, at the time of application:
(a) Sixty-five years of age and over, or whose spouses, living with
them, are 65 years of age or over, or 60 years of age or over
and the surviving spouse of a taxpayer qualified in the Town of
Cromwell under this section at the time of his or her death, or
with respect to real property on which such residents or their
spouses are liable for taxes under C.G.S. § 12-48; or
(b) Under age 65 and eligible in accordance with applicable federal
regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits under
social security, or who have not been engaged in employment
covered by social security and accordingly have not been
qualified for those benefits, but have become qualified for
permanent total disability benefits under any federal, state or
local government retirement or disability plan, including the
Railroad Retirement Act and any government-related teachers
retirement plan, in which requirements with respect to
qualifications for such permanent total disability benefits are
comparable to such requirements under social security, provided
such residents or their spouses under Subsection A(1)(a) or (b)
above have been taxpayers of Cromwell for one year immediately
preceding the receipt of tax benefits under this section.
(2) Taxpayers otherwise eligible under this section who are unit owners
of a cooperative shall also be eligible for a tax deferral in accordance
with C.G.S. § 12-129n, as amended from time to time.
(3) Taxpayers with only a life use interest in real property who use the
property as their principal residence and pay property taxes may
qualify for a tax deferral, provided that the record owner(s) consent
to the deferral and the filing of a lien on the land records.
§ 211-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 211-19
1:277
(4) Upon the death of a beneficiary of a tax deferral, the surviving
spouse may continue to be eligible if he or she is 60 years of age or
older as of the date of the qualifying taxpayers death. The surviving
spouse will be required to file for a deferral with the Town Assessor
annually and meet all other program eligibility guidelines. The
surviving spouse may apply as a primary applicant if totally disabled
prior to reaching the qualifying age as specified in Subsection
A(1)(b) of this section.
(5) Principal residence shall be defined as full-time residence at the
property for which deferral is sought for at least one year preceding
the date of application. "Full-time" shall mean occupancy as the
qualifying taxpayer(s) residence for more than 183 days of each
calendar year.
(6) All real estate taxes for the property must be current by May 1 next
following the date of application for tax deferral.
B. Income qualifications.
(1) Residents must meet the requirements with respect to maximum
income allowable during the calendar year preceding the year in
which a deferral application is made. Maximum qualifying income
limits for each applicant shall not exceed those set forth in C.G.S.
§ 12-170aa plus $5,000. Because the income ceilings for program
qualification are based on the guidelines used by the state Office
of Policy and Management (OPM) in connection with its tax relief
program for the elderly and disabled, they shall be adjusted annually
to reflect each year's current income standards.
(2) Upon recommendation of the Board of Finance, the maximum
allowable income levels may be modified by the Town Council. Such
changes, if any, are to be implemented prior to the beginning of the
next ensuing application period.
(3) The applicant's qualifying income is the total income of the applicant
and all record owner(s) or, in the case of a tenant in common or
a qualifying taxpayer with life use who pays the property taxes,
his or her total income, each together with the applicant's spouse,
as applicable or as defined in the State Guidelines for Elderly and
Totally Disabled Tax Relief Programs. In addition, qualifying income
shall include adjusted gross income as defined in the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954 as amended, social security benefits, railroad
retirement benefits, income from other tax-exempt retirement and
annuity sources, as well as any other taxable and nontaxable income.
(4) Specifically excluded from qualifying income are social security
payments made on behalf of a dependent person, casualty loss
reimbursement by insurance companies, grants for disaster relief
and life insurance proceeds.
§ 211-20. Application.

year, including a copy of the applicant's SSA-1099 and federal tax
returns for the preceding calendar year and any other income
documentation as may be requested by the Assessor to determine
eligibility hereunder. If a tax return is not filed, a SSA-1099 and
all other 1099 forms received shall be provided along with any
other income documentation as may be requested by the Assessor to
determine eligibility hereunder. The applicant shall sign an affidavit

applying taxpayer is eligible for a tax deferral under this program
and shall notify the Tax Collector and each applicant, in writing, of
his or her eligibility and the amount of deferred tax by June 1 or
within two weeks following establishment of that year's mill rate,
whichever occurs later.
B. Benefits:
(1) Any property tax deferral benefits received by any resident in
accordance with the provisions of this section shall not disqualify
such resident from receiving any benefits described in C.G.S.
§§ 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and C.G.S. § 12-170aa, and any
such property tax relief provided under this section shall be in
addition to any benefits for which a resident is eligible under those
sections.
§ 211-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 211-21
1:279
(2) In cases where a qualifying taxpayer holds title to real property
jointly with non-qualified persons, the qualifying taxpayer will
receive a deferral benefit in an amount proportional to his or her
ownership interest, and the non-qualified persons shall not receive
any tax deferral.
(3) The tax deferral shall be granted in connection with principal
residences, including the improvements and the minimum lot size

annually by Cromwell shall be determined by the Board of Finance

property tax assessed in Cromwell in the preceding tax year. If
the qualified applications for deferred tax exceed the total deferred
property tax revenue set by the Board of Finance for that year, the
amount of deferred tax allowed for each qualifying taxpayer shall
be equitably prorated in accordance with each qualifying taxpayer's
share of the total deferred tax requested by all qualifying taxpayers.

tax assessment for the year preceding the application, and, upon
approval of benefits, shall remain in effect for one year, unless one of
the following occurs:
(a) A revaluation results in less tax owed on a property than the
deferred tax amount, which would require that the deferred tax
amount be reduced;
(b) The property has a significant increase or decrease in value; or
(c) The Towns total deferred property tax revenue exceeds the
maximum amount established in Subsection C(1) above,
requiring a pro-rata decrease in the deferral amount for all
eligible residents.
(3) The property tax deferral amount, together with any other relief
received by a qualifying taxpayer under the provisions of C.G.S.
§§ 12-129b to 12-129d, inclusive, and C.G.S. § 12-170aa, shall not
exceed 75% of the total amount of annual tax due for any eligible
real property.
(4) The total amount of all liens and accrued interest, if any, shall not
exceed the assessed value of the property. Qualifying taxpayers or
their designees will receive an annual statement from the Collector
indicating total amounts deferred to date.
(5) While both are in effect, qualifying taxpayers shall only be eligible
for benefits from one of the senior and/or disabled tax relief
programs offered by the Town of Cromwell pursuant to either Article

the land records annually. All liens filed pursuant hereto may be
foreclosed in the same manner and according to the same provisions
provided in the general statutes for foreclosure of a municipal
property tax lien.

taxpayer's estate, and shall be valid without any limitation of time.
All deferred taxes shall be reimbursed to the Town within 180 days of
the death of the qualifying taxpayer(s) or the sale, transfer or other
conveyance of the real property, whichever occurs first. Taxes not
paid within 180 days shall accrue interest commencing on day 181 at
the same rate and shall be subject to the same rules provided for by
state law with respect to payment and collection of delinquent real
property taxes.

Tax Relief Deferral Program for Elderly and Disabled Homeowners
[Adopted TC 11-20-2013; amended in its entirety TC 4-29-2015]
§ 211-28.1. Statutory authority; purpose.
The Town of Cromwell hereby enacts a tax deferral program for elderly
and disabled homeowners pursuant to Section 12-129n of the Connecticut
General Statutes for eligible residents of the Town of Cromwell on the terms
and conditions provided herein. The program is enacted for the purpose of
preventing eligible homeowners from having to sell or transfer their homes
as a result of tax liability. This program shall be known as the "Cromwell
Senior and Disabled Tax Deferral Program."
§ 211-28.2. Eligibility.
An applicant shall meet the following criteria to be eligible for this program:
A. Taxpayer qualifications.
(1) Tax deferrals shall be granted in connection with real property
owned and occupied as a principal residence by taxpayers of the
Town of Cromwell who are, at the time of application:
(a) Sixty-five years of age and over, or whose spouses, living with
them, are 65 years of age or over, or 60 years of age or over
and the surviving spouse of a taxpayer qualified in the Town of
Cromwell under this section at the time of his or her death, or
with respect to real property on which such residents or their
spouses are liable for taxes under C.G.S. § 12-48; or
(b) Under age 65 and eligible in accordance with applicable federal
regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits under
Social Security, or who have not been engaged in employment
covered by Social Security and accordingly have not been
qualified for those benefits, but have become qualified for
permanent total disability benefits under any federal, state or
local government retirement or disability plan, including the
Railroad Retirement Act and any government-related teacher's
retirement plan, in which requirements with respect to
qualifications for such permanent total disability benefits are
comparable to such requirements under Social Security,
provided such residents or their spouses under Subsection
A(1)(a) or (b) above, have been taxpayers of Cromwell for one
year immediately preceding the receipt of tax benefits under this
section.
(2) Taxpayers otherwise eligible under this section who are unit owners
of a cooperative shall also be eligible for a tax deferral in accordance
with C.G.S. § 12-129n, as amended from time to time.
(3) Taxpayers with only a life use interest in real property who use the
property as their principal residence and pay property taxes may
qualify for a tax deferral, provided that the record owner(s) consent
to the deferral and the filing of a lien on the land records.
§ 211-28.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 211-28.2
1:283
(4) Upon the death of a beneficiary of a tax deferral, the surviving
spouse may continue to be eligible if he or she is 60 years of age or
older as of the date of the qualifying taxpayer's death. The surviving
spouse will be required to file for a deferral with the Town Assessor
annually and meet all other program eligibility guidelines. The
surviving spouse may apply as a primary applicant if totally disabled
prior to reaching the qualifying age as specified in (A)(1)(b) of this
section.
(5) Principal residence shall be defined as full-time residence at the
property for which deferral is sought for at least one year preceding
the date of application. "Full-time" shall mean occupancy as the
qualifying taxpayer's(s') residence for more than 183 days of each
calendar year.
(6) All real estate taxes for the property must be current by May 1 next
following the date of application for tax deferral.
B. Income qualifications.
(1) Residents must meet the requirements with respect to maximum
income allowable during the calendar year preceding the year in
which a deferral application is made. Maximum qualifying income
limits for each applicant shall not exceed those set forth in C.G.S.
§ 12-170aa plus $5,000. Because the income ceilings for program
qualification are based on the guidelines used by the state Office
of Policy and Management (OPM) in connection with its tax relief
program for the elderly and disabled, they shall be adjusted annually
to reflect each year's current income standards.
(2) Upon recommendation of the Board of Finance, the maximum
allowable income levels may be modified by the Board of Selectmen.
Such changes, if any, are to be implemented prior to the beginning
of the next ensuing application period.
(3) The applicant's qualifying income is the total income of the applicant
and all record owner(s) or, in the case of a tenant in common or
a qualifying taxpayer with life use who pays the property taxes,
his or her total income, each together with the applicant's spouse,
as applicable or as defined in the State Guidelines for Elderly and
Totally Disabled Tax Relief Programs. In addition, qualifying income
shall include adjusted gross income as defined in the Internal
Revenue Code of 1954 as amended, Social Security benefits, railroad
retirement benefits, income from other tax-exempt retirement and
annuity sources, as well as any other taxable and nontaxable income.
(4) Specifically excluded from qualifying income are Social Security
payments made on behalf of a dependent person, casualty loss
reimbursement by insurance companies, grants for disaster relief
and life insurance proceeds.
§ 211-28.3. Application.
A. Application for benefits under this program shall:

SECTION 1
TITLE AND AUTHORITY
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the state of Connecticut are an indispensable
and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have
been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential
to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and
control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to
the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and
watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated
use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or
obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have
despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity
has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and
ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the
environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational
values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation
and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable
and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to
the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of
these regulations to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the
protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by
minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in
accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing
damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial
aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats
thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality
of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and
other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water
supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by
providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and
the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever
guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit
and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetland and Watercourses Regulations
of the Town of Cromwell". They shall be administered by the Inland Wetland and
Watercourses Agency of the Town of Cromwell.
1.3 The Inland Wetland and Watercourses Agency of the Town of Cromwell was established
in accordance with an ordinance adopted January 17, 1974 and is empowered to
implement the purposes and provisions of the Inland Wetland and Watercourses Act in
the Town of Cromwell.

accordance with Section 8 of these regulations at least sixty-five (65) days prior to the
expiration date of the permit. Any application to renew or amend such an existing permit
shall contain the information required under Section 8 of these regulations provided:
a. The application may incorporate the documentation and record of the original
application;
b. The application shall describe the extend of work completed at the time of filing
and the schedule for completing the activities authorized in the permit;
c. The application shall state the reason why the authorized activity was not initiated
or completed within the time specified in the permit;
d. The application shall describe any changes in facts or circumstances involved with
or affecting wetlands or watercourses or use of the land for which the permit was
issued;
e. The Agency may, prior to the expiration of a permit, accept an untimely application
to renew such permit if the authorized activity is ongoing and allow the continuation
of work beyond the expiration date if, in its judgement, the permit is likely to be
renewed and the public interest or environment will be best served by not
interrupting the activity.
7.10 Any application to renew a permit shall be granted upon request of the permit holder
unless the Agency finds that there has been a substantial change in circumstances which
requires a new permit application or an enforcement action has been undertaken with
17
regard to the regulated activity for which the permit was issued provided no permit may
be valid form more than ten years.
7.11 If the Agency deems that a peer review of any information submitted by the applicant is
warranted, the applicant will be required to pay the cost of that peer review prior to a final
decision.
7.11 Vernal Pool Indicators
a. Direct Indicators: The wildlife species listed below require vernal pools for
successful reproduction, and are therefore considered "obligate vernal pool species".
They serve as direct indicators of the existence of a vernal pool ecosystem and are
the primary beneficiaries of vernal pool ecosystem protection. Documentation of
vernal pool use by these species is the best way to identify vernal pool ecosystems.
Either of the following categories will verify the existence of a vernal pool
ecosystem:
1. Category 1: The existence of a seasonal watercourse in a confined basin or
depression that lacks a fish population, and shows evidence of breeding or
development by any of the following amphibian obligate species: spotted
salamander; marbled salamander; wood frog; Jefferson salamander/bluespotted
salamander complex.
As required by this definition, acceptable proof of breeding or development of
these obligate species include one or more of the following items:
Breeding:
a. Breeding adults:
1. Wood frogs: breeding chorus and/or mated pairs;
2. Obligate salamanders: courting individuals and/or spermatophores.
b. Two or more egg masses of any of the above-named species.
Development:
c. Tadpoles or larvae of the above species;
d. Transforming juveniles:
1. Wood frogs: tail stubs evident;
2. Obligate salamanders: gill remnants evident.
2. Category 2: The existence of a seasonal watercourse in a confined basin or
depression that lacks a fish population, and contains fairy shrimp or their eggs.
b. Indirect Indicators: In the absence of direct indicators (typically when the pool is
dry from late summer through early fall, or during the winter), indirect indicators
may be used to gauge the likelihood that a watercourse is capable of supporting
18
obligate species. The more indirect indicators there are (especially indirect
indicators 1 through 4), the greater the likelihood that a particular watercourse is a
vernal pool.
A defined depression or basin should be examined for the following indirect
indicators:
1. Fingernail clam shells, snail shells, caddis fly cases, diving beetles or evidence
of other aquatic invertebrates, among the leaf litter;
2. Presence of algal strands hanging over branches, or silt-stained leaves;
3. Dense wetland plant growth (e.g. buttonbush, burr-reed, etc.) In the interior of
the basin or depression;
4. A distinct waterline on the base of tree trunks or shrubs in the basin;
(Items 1 through 4 are strong indicators, indicating that the pool holds water
long enough to support breeding by obligate species)
5. Discolored water-stained gray leaf litter within the basin as distinguished from
the brown leaves on the adjacent upland floor;
6. Hummocks supporting moss, grass, sedges or woody growth along the edge of
the basin or depression;
7. Unvegetated, low-lying area or areas in the basin interior;
8. Standing water or ice in winter.
(Items 5 through 8 are moderate indicators that might signify the presence of a
vernal pool but do not provide strong evidence that the pool holds water long
enough to support breeding obligate species)
7.12 For any permit application involving property subject to a conservation restriction or
preservation restriction, the following shall apply:
a. For purposes of this section, "conservation restriction" means a limitation, whether
or not stated in the form of a restriction, easement , covenant or condition, in any
deed, will or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the owner of the land
described therein, including, but not limited to, the state or any political subdivision
of the state, or in any order of taking such land whose purpose is to retain land or
water areas predominantly in their natural, scenic or open condition or in
agricultural, farming, forest or open space use.
19
b. For purposes of this section, "preservation restriction" means a limitation, whether
or not stated in the form of a restriction, easement , covenant or condition, in any
deed, will or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the owner of the land
described therein, including, but not limited to, the state or any political subdivision
of the state, or in any order of taking of such land whose purpose is to preserve
historically significant structures or sites.
c. No person shall file a permit application, other than for interior work in an existing
building or for exterior work on an existing building that does not expand or alter
the footprint of such existing building, relating to property that is subject to a
conservation restriction or a preservation restriction unless the applicant provides
proof that the applicant has provided written notice of such application, by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the party holding such restriction, including, but
not limited to, any state agency that holds such restriction, not later than sixty days
prior to the filing of the permit application.
d. In lieu of such notice pursuant to subsection 7.12c, the applicant may submit a letter
from the holder of such restriction or from the holder's authorized agent, verifying
that the application is in compliance with the terms of the restriction.
SECTION 8

information shall not stay the time limitations as set forth in Subsection 10.2 of these
regulations.
8.7 All applications shall be open for public inspection.
8.8 Incomplete applications may be denied.
SECTION 9
PUBLIC HEARINGS
9.1 The Agency shall not hold a public hearing on an application unless the Agency
determines that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or
watercourses, a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons who are eighteen years of
age or older and who reside in the municipality in which the regulated activity is
proposed, requesting a hearing is filed with the Agency not later than fourteen days after
21
the date of receipt of such application, or the Agency finds that a public hearing regarding
such application would be in the public interest. The agency may issue a permit without
public hearing provided no petition provided for in this section is filed with the agency on
or before the fourteenth day after the date of receipt of the application. Such hearing
shall be held no later than sixty-five days after the receipt of such application. All
applications and maps and documents relating thereto shall be open for public inspection.
Any person may appear and be heard at any such public hearing.

throughout the public hearing.
SECTION 10
CONSIDERATIONS FOR DECISION
10.1 The Agency may consider the following in making its decision on an application:
a. The application and its supporting documentation.
b. Public comments, evidence and testimony.
c. Reports from other agencies and commissions including but not limited to the Town
of Cromwell Conservation Commission, Planning and Zoning Commission,
Building Official, and Health Officer.
22
d. The Agency may also consider comments on any application from the Connecticut
River Coastal Conservation District, the Midstate Regional Planning Agency, or
other regional organizations (e.g. Council of Governments); agencies in adjacent
municipalities which may be affected by the proposed activity, or other technical
agencies or organizations which may undertake additional studies or investigations.
If the Agency deems that a peer review of any information submitted by the
applicant is warranted, the applicant will be required to pay the cost of that peer
review prior to a final decision.
e. Non-receipt of comments from agencies and commissions listed in Subsections
10.1.c and d above within the prescribed time shall neither delay nor prejudice the
decision of the Agency.
10.2 Criteria for Decision: In carrying out the purposes and policies of Section 22a-36 to 22a-
45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to
regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into
consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or
watercourses;
b. The applicant's purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the
proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental
impact to wetlands or watercourses;
c. The relationship between the short-term and long term impacts of the proposed
regulated activity on wetlands and watercourses and the maintenance and
enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would
be caused by the proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such
activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such
resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of
issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1)
prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or
enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority:
restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;
e. The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health, or the
reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated
activity; and
f. The suitability of the activity to the area for which it is proposed. This requires a
balancing of the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land,
23
with the need to protect its environment and ecology for the people of the state and
the benefit of generations yet unborn.
g. Impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the
area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or
reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by
the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands or
watercourses.
10.3 In the case of any application which received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by the
Agency that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or
watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the Agency finds on the basis of the
record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In making this finding the
Agency shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in Subsection 10.2 of these
regulations. The finding and the reasons therefor shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be
feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less
adverse impact on wetlands or watercourses, the Agency shall propose on the record in
writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this
subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is
entitled to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) wetlands and watercourses includes aquatic, plant or
animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) habitats means areas or
environments in which an organism or biological population normally lives or occurs.
10.6 A municipal inland wetlands agency shall not deny or condition an application for a
regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or
effect on aquatic, plant, or animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the
physical characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Agency shall base its
decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other material not in the
hearing record shall not be considered by the Agency in its decision. A conclusion that a
feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does not create a presumption that a permit
should be issued. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that his application is
consistent with the purposes and policies of these regulations and Sections 22a-36 to 22a-
45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes.
10.8 In the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice pursuant to
subsection 7.12c or 7.12d of these regulations, the holder of the restriction may provide
proof to the inland wetlands agency that granting of the permit application will violate the
24
terms of the restriction. Upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of
such restriction, the inland wetlands agency shall not grant the permit approval.
10.9 In the case of an application where the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of
subsections 7.12c or 7.12d of these regulations, the party holding the conservation or
preservation restriction, other than a state agency that holds such restriction, may, not
later than fifteen days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with
the inland wetlands agency, subject to the rules and regulations of such agency relating to
appeals. The inland wetlands agency shall reverse the permit approval upon a finding
that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction; or (2) the state agency
that holds such restriction may, not later than thirty days after receipt of actual notice of
permit approval, file an appeal with the inland wetlands agency, subject to the rules and
regulations of such agency relating to appeals. The inland wetlands agency shall
immediately reverse such permit approval if the commissioner of the state agency that
holds such restriction certifies that the land use authorized in such permit violates the
terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.
10.10 Nothing in subsections 7.12c or 7.12d of these regulations shall be construed to prohibit
the filing of a permit application or to require such written notice when the activity that is
the subject of such permit application will occur on a portion of property that is not
restricted under the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.
SECTION 11
DECISION PROCESS AND PERMIT
11.1 The Agency, or its duly authorized agent acting pursuant to Section 12 of these
regulations, may, in accordance with Section 10 of these regulations, grant the application
as filed or grant it upon other terms, conditions, limitations or modifications of the

more extensions of the periods specified in this subsection, provided the total of all such
25
extensions shall not be for longer than sixty-five (65) days, or may withdraw such
application. The failure of the Agency to act within any time period specified in this
subsection, or any extension thereof, shall not be deemed to constitute approval of the
application. An application deemed incomplete by the agency shall be withdrawn by the
applicant or denied by the agency.
11.3 The Agency shall state upon its record the reasons and bases for its decision.
11.4 The Agency shall notify the applicant and any person entitled to such notice of its
decision within fifteen (15) days of the date of the decision by certified mail, return

of the permit, to be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the town
wherein the inland wetland or watercourse lies. In any case in which such notice is not
published within such fifteen day period, the applicant may provide for the publication of
such notice within ten days thereafter.
11.5 If an activity authorized by an inland wetland permit also involves an activity which
requires zoning or subdivision approval, a special permit, or a variance, a copy of the
decision and report on the application shall be filed with the Town of Cromwell Planning
and Zoning Commission within fifteen days of the date of the decision.
11.6 Any permit issued by the Agency for the development of land for which an approval is
required under Section 8-3, 8-25 or 8-26 of the Connecticut General Statutes shall be
valid for five years provided the Agency may establish a specific time period within
which any regulated activity shall be conducted. Any permit issued by the Agency for
any other activity shall be valid for not less than two years and not more than five years.
11.7 No permit issued by the Agency shall be assigned or transferred without the written
permission of the Agency.
11.8 If a bond or insurance is required in accordance with Section 13 of these regulations, no
permit shall be issued until such bond or insurance is provided.
11.9 The Agency may require the applicant to pay for an environmental specialist to ensure
compliance with the approved "Erosion and Sediment Control Narrative and Construction
Sequence", conduct regular and special site inspections, be present during
environmentally-sensitive construction activity as directed by the Agency, and any other
related activities deemed appropriate by the Agency. No permit shall be issued until the
applicant has paid this amount to the Town.
26
11.10 General provisions in the issuance of all permits:
a. The Agency has relied in whole or in part on information provided the applicant and
if such information subsequently proves to be false, deceptive, incomplete or
inaccurate, the permit may be modified, suspended or revoked.
b. All permits issued by the Agency are subject to and do not derogate any present or
future rights or powers of the Agency or the Town of Cromwell, and convey no

SECTION 12
ACTION BY DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT
12.1 The Agency may delegate to its duly authorized agent the authority to approve or extend a
license for an activity that is not located in a wetland or watercourse when such agent
finds that the conduct of such activity would result in a no greater that a minimal impact
on any wetlands or watercourses provided such agent has completed the comprehensive
training program developed by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection pursuant
to Section 22a-39 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Requests for such approval shall
be made on a form provided by the Agency and shall contain the information listed under
Section 6.5 of these regulations and any other information the Agency may reasonable
require. Notwithstanding the provisions for receipt and processing applications
prescribed in Sections 7, 8, and 10 of these regulations, such agent may approve or extend
such an activity at any time.
12.2 Any person receiving such approval from such agent shall, within ten days of the date of
such approval, publish, at the applicants expense, notice of the approval in a newspaper
having a general circulation in the town wherein the activity is located or will have an
effect. Any person may appeal such decision of such agent to the Agency within fifteen
days after the publication date of the notice and the Agency shall consider such appeal at
its next regularly scheduled meeting provided such meeting is no earlier than three
business days after receipt by such Agency or its agent of such appeal. Any person may
appear and be heard at the meeting held by the Agency to consider the subject appeal.
The Agency shall, at its discretion, sustain, alter, or reject the decision of its agent or
require an application for a permit in accordance with Section 6 of these regulations.
28
SECTION 13
BOND AND INSURANCE
13.1 The Agency may require as a permit condition the filing of a bond with such surety in
such amount and in a form approved by the Agency.
13.2 The bond or surety shall be conditioned on compliance with all provisions of these
regulations and the terms, conditions and limitations established in the permit.
SECTION 14
ENFORCEMENT
14.1 The Agency may appoint an agent or agents to act in its behalf with the authority to
inspect property, except a private residence, and issue notices of violation or cease and
desist orders and carry out other actions or investigations necessary for the enforcement
of these regulations. In carrying out the purposes of this section, the Agency or its duly
authorized agent shall take into consideration the criteria for decision under Section 10.2
of these regulations. The Agency may appoint an agent or agents to act in its behalf with
the authority to issue notices of violation or cease and desist orders and carry out other
actions or investigations necessary for the enforcement of these regulations.
14.2 The Agency or its agent may make regular inspections, at reasonable hours, of all
regulated activities for which permits have been issued with the consent of the property
owner or the authorized agent of the owner during the life of the permit. This permission
shall be indicated on the permit application.
14.3 In the case in which a permit has not been issued or a permit has expired, the Agency or
its agent may make regular inspections at reasonable hours with the consent of the
property owner or the authorized agent of the property owner.
14.4 If the Agency or its designated agent finds that any person is conducting or maintaining
any activity, facility, or condition which is in violation of the Act or these regulations, the
Agency or its duly authorized agent may:
a. Issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such person
conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or condition to immediately
cease such activity or to correct such facility or condition. Within ten (10) calendar
days of the issuance of such order the Agency shall hold a hearing to provide the
person an opportunity to be heard and show cause why the order should not remain
in effect. The Agency shall consider the fact presented at the hearing and within ten
(10) days of the completion of the hearing notify the person by certified mail that
the original order remains in effect, that a revised order is in effect, or that the order
has been withdrawn. The Agency shall publish notice of its decision in a newspaper
29
having general circulation in the municipality. The original order shall be effective
upon issuance and shall remain in effect until the Agency affirms, revises or
withdraws the order. The issuance of an order pursuant to this subsection shall not
delay or bar an action pursuant to Section 22a-44(b) of the General Statutes, as
amended.
b. Issue a notice of violation to such person conducting such activity or maintaining
such facility or condition, stating the nature of the violation, the jurisdiction of the
Agency, and prescribing the necessary action and steps to correct the violation
including, without limitation, halting work in wetlands or watercourses. The
Agency may request that the individual appear at the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Agency to discuss the unauthorized activity, and/or provide a written
reply to the notice or file a proper application for the necessary permit. Failure to
carry out the action(s) directed in a notice of violation may result in issuance of the
order provided in Subsection 13.3.a or other enforcement proceedings as provided
by law. Other actions may include the filing of a certificate of such order in the
Office of the Town Clerk indexed under the name of the property owner(s). Such
certificate shall be released upon compliance with such order.
14.5. The Agency may suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the permittee has not
complied with the terms, conditions, or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded
the scope of the work as set forth in the application including application plans. Prior to
revoking or suspending any permit, the Agency shall issue notice to the permittee,
personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct
which warrants the intended action. The Agency shall hold a public hearing to provide
the permittee an opportunity to show that it is in compliance with its permit and any and
all requirements for retention of the permit. The permittee shall be notified of the
Agency's decision to suspend, revoke, or maintain a permit by certified mail within
fifteen (15) days of the date of its decision. The Agency shall publish notice of the
suspension or revocation in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality.
14.6. The enforcement remedies referred to herein are not intended to limit any other remedies
available in law or equity including, without limitation, fines and penalties otherwise
provided by law.
SECTION 15
AMENDMENTS
15.1 These regulations and the Wetlands Base Map for the Town of Cromwell may be
amended from time to time, by the Agency in accordance with changes in the Connecticut
General Statutes or regulations of the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection, or as new information regarding soils and inland wetlands and watercourses

HOW TO USE THESE REGULATIONS
PHILOSOPHY
These Zoning Regulations are intended to guide land use activities in Cromwell in ways thatwill:
protect the public health, safety, and welfare,
maintain and enhance community character, and
improve the economic value of property and general welfare ofresidents.
It is recognized that the appearance of property has a direct bearing on the economic value of that property and
also the economic value of adjacent and surrounding properties. The appearance of a single property also has a
cumulative effect which can enhance or diminish the beauty of the entire Town, and consequently the values of
property elsewhere within the Town.

Because of the Downtown Cromwell District's proximity to the "Upper Houses National Register Historic
District" and the "Main Street National Register Historic District," and because the purpose of these regulations
is to encourage appropriate, pedestrian-oriented development consistent or compatible with the area, the
appearance of any new or modified structure shall be a factor in the Commissions' decision. Therefore:
1. Any application for Site Plan Approval involving commercial or multi-family construction
must include architectural renderings of the structure. The Commission may call upon other
agencies, organizations, or qualified individuals to aid it in evaluating a project.
2. Any application submitted to the Town Planner for the construction of or substantial
changes to a single-family house must include architectural renderings of the house. The
Town Planner will forward those renderings to the Commission for its review before
granting Zoning Approval. The Commission may call upon other agencies, organizations,
or qualified individuals to aid it in evaluating a project.
3. Any application submitted to the Town Planner for the rehabilitation or alteration of an
existing commercial structure must include architectural renderings of the proposed
rehabilitation or alteration. The Town Planner will forward those renderings to the
Commission for its review before granting Zoning Approval. The Commission may call
upon other agencies, organizations, or qualified individuals to aid it in evaluating these
renderings.
3.1.F Pre-Application Review.

4.2 SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA OVERLAY DISTRICT (SFHAOD)
4.2.A Statutory Authorization.
The Legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7- 148 and in Title 8, Chapter
124, Section 8- 2of the General Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Cromwell, Connecticut, hereby established a Special Flood
Hazard Area Overlay District.
4.2.B Finding of Fact.
1. The flood hazard areas of the Town of Cromwell are subject to periodic flood inundation
which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safoty and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains
causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard

uses vulnerable to floods or to other lands which are inadequately
flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled
'""'""''n~ and use floodplains can adversely affect the community.
Town of Cromwell has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) since prior to 1990. The NFrP is founded on a mutual agreement between
the Federal government and each participating community. Local, State and Federal
governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the
NFIP. The community's role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to
receive Federally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the
minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
4.2.C Purpose.
It is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development, promote public health, safety, and
general welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
4.2.D
1. To protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;
5. To minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the
floodplain;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood
hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas;
7. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;
8. To prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in
conflicts between property owners;
9. To ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their
actions; and
10. To discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate
the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.
Objectives.
[n order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes objectives, methods and provisions that:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;

regulatory floodway limits.
Floodplain Variance. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain management
regulation that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would
result in unnecessary hardship.
Floodplain Violation. Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's

equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure as determined at the beginning of such ten
( l 0) year period. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual
repair work performed. For purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
or
2. Any alteration of a "historic" structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a ·'historic structure."

BUSINESS ZONES
67
Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study for the Town of
CromwelL dated August 28, 2008, and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)
and/or Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM), dated August 28, 2008, and other
supporting data, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into
this regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map
amendment or map revision is obtained from FEMA.
2. The SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A, Al-30, AE, AO, and AH,
including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM or FBFM. SFHAs are determined
utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs
published in the FIS for a specific location. Also included are areas of potential,
demonstrable or historical flooding, including any area contiguous with but outside the
SFHA identified by FEMA, and where the land surface elevation is lower than the base
flood elevation (BFE) as shown in the FIS, and the area is not protected from flooding by a
natural or man-made feature. The FIRM, FBFM and FIS are on file in the office of the
Town Engineer at the Cromwell Town Hall.
4.2.H Structures Already In Compliance.
A structure or development already in compliance with this regulation shall not be made non-compliant by any
alteration, modification, repair, reconstruction or improvement and must also comply with other applicable
local, State, and Federal regulations. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted,
modified or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this regulation and other applicable
regulations.
4.2.I Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
This regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any ex1stmg easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this regulation and another ordinance, regulation easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
4.2.J Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this regulation, all provisions shall be:
1. considered as minimum requirements;
2. liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and;
deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.
4.2.K Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does
not imply or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or uses permitted in such areas will be
free from flooding and flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of
Cromwell or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
regulation or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. The Town of Cromwell, its officers and

11. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the area of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions) the Public Works Director (or his designee) shall
make necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this regulation.

2. Require the applicant to provide base flood elevation data for all proposed development,
manufactured home parks and subdivisions.
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance
with Section 4.2.G and Section 4.2.P, the Public Works Director (or his designee) shall
obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available
from a Federal, State or other source in order to administer the provisions of Section4.2.R.
14. All records pertaining to the provisions of this regulation shall be obtained and maintained
in the office of the Public Works Director (or his designee).
15. Upon completion of the permitted development and prior to issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy (CO), necessary as-built surveys (prepared by a Connecticut Licensed
Professional as per Connecticut State Statutes) and engineering and architectural
certifications shall be provided to the Public Works Director (or his designee)
demonstrating compliance with the approved plans and standards set forth in Section 4.2.P.
General Standards.
In all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) the following provisions are required:
1. New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have sustained substantial
damage shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
2. New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have sustained substantial
damage shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
3. New construction, substantial improvements, and repairs to structures that have sustained
substantial damage shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of
the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
4. New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained
substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water.
5. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, HY AC ductwork,
and other service facilities, or any machinery or utility equipment or connections servicing
a structure shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE) to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This
includes, but is not limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps,
hot water heaters, ventilation ductwork, washer and dryer hook-ups, electrical junction
boxes, and circuit breaker boxes.
6. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the system.
7. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharges from the system into flood
waters.
8. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding.
9. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the
structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad,
or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have
the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not

BUSINESS ZONES
72
allow for the infiltration of water.
In any a watercourse that or the flood capacity must
maintained. Notify adjacent communities and the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection (DEEP), Inland Water Resources Division prior to any alteration
or relocation of a watercourse.
11. If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire
structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction
requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages,
decks. sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches
that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the
standards of the more restrictive zone.
12. If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most
restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V zone is more restrictive than A zone:
structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions,
garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. (Decks or
porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the
requirements of the more restrictive zone.)
13. Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas
which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new
construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure,
shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be
provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it
shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for
flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the
theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the I 00-year flood
elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume
shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body.
Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
14. Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced,
as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments
resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase
in footprint of the structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a
registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such
encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood
elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including
work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause
an increase in flood stage or flood velocity.
4.2.S Standards for Watercourses without Established Base Flood Elevations (Un-numbered
A Zone), Adopted Floodways and/or Flood Mapping.
1. The Public Works Director shall require base flood elevation (BFE) data be provided with
any application for new construction, substantial improvement, repair to structures which
have sustained substantial damage or other development in Zone A without a FEMApublished
BFE (un-numbered A Zone). The Public Works Director (or his designee) shall
obtain, review and reasonably utilize any BFE and floodway data available from a Federal,
State or other source, including data developed for subdivision proposals, as criteria for
Cromwell Zoning Regulations I 8.25.2015
BUSINESS ZONES
73
new construction. substantial improvements, repair to structures which have
substantial damage or other development in un-numbered A Zones on the
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) meet the standards in Section 4.2.P and
4.2.T. If no BFE can be determined. the lowest floor. including basement, must be
elevated to two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade next to the structure.
2. When BFEs have been determined within Zones Al-30 and AE on the community's FIRM
but a regulatory tloodway has not been designated, the Public Works Director must require
that no new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have
sustained substantial damage or other development, including fill, shall be permitted which
will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one ( 1.0) foot at any
point within the community when all existing and anticipated development is considered
cumulatively with the proposed development.
3. The Public Works Director may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses
without FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or
whenever such data is available from any other source (in response to the municipality's
request or not), the community shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle
that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing
the water surface elevation more than one ( 1.0) foot at any point within the community.
4. The Public Works Director shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any BFE and
floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained
substantial damage or other development in any area of potential. demonstrable or
historical flooding within the community meet the standards in Section 4.2.P and Section
4.2.T.
Under the provisions of 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter I, Section 65.12, of the National Flood
Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A 1-30, AE, AH, on
the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one ( 1.0)
foot, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12.
4.2. T Specific Standards.
1. Construction Standards in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), Zones A, A 1-30,AE.
2. Residential Construction. All new construction, substantial improvements, and repair to
structures that have sustained substantial damage which are residential structures shall have
the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood
elevation (BFE). Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the
structure must be elevated to or above the BFE.
3. Non-Residential Construction.
(1) All new construction, substantial improvements, and repair to structures that have
sustained substantial damage which are commercial, industrial or
non-residential structures shall:
a) Have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or
above the base flood elevation (BFE); or
(2) In lieu of being elevated, non-residential structures may be dry flood-proofed to
one (I) foot above the BFE provided that together with all attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are
Cromwell Zoning Regulations j 8.25.2015
BUSINESS ZONES
74
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage water. and
that such structures are composed of structural components having
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
A Connecticut registered profossional engineer or architect shall
review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of
this section. Such certification shall be provided to the Public Works Director
(or his designee) on the FEMA Flood proofing Certificate, Form 8 I -65.
(3) Electrical. plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the
structure must be elevated to or above the BFE.
4. Fully Enclosed Areas Below The Base Flood Elevation of Elevated Buildings.
(1) All new construction, substantial improvements, or repair of substantial damage to
residential or non-residential structures that include fully enclosed areas
formed by a foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation
(BFE) of an elevated building, shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and be designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls (wet
flood-proofing). Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a Connecticut registered professional engineer or architect, or meet
the following minimum criteria listed in sections (a)-(g) below:
a) Provide a minimum of two (2) openings (hydraulic flood vents) having a
total net area of not less than one ( l) square inch for every one (I)
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. These hydraulic
openings must be located on at least two (2) different walls. Only the
area (square footage) that lies below the BFE can be used in the
calculation of net area of vents required. lf the structure has more than
one ( 1) enclosed area, openings must be installed in the exterior walls
of each enclosed area so that flood waters can enter directly from the
outside;
b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (I) foot above
grade. At least one side of the structure's fully enclosed area must be at
or above grade. Fill placed around the foundation walls must be graded
so that the elevation inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than
the adjacent outside elevation on at least one ( 1) side of the building.
The finished floor of the enclosed area shall be no lower than the
bottom of the foundation openings. The foundation slab of a residential
structure, including the slab of a crawlspace, must be set equal to the
outside finished grade on at least one side of the building;
c) The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters in both directions without any external influence or
control such as human intervention, including the use of electrical and
other non-automatic mechanical means. Other coverings may be
designed and certified by an engineer or approved by the Public Works
Director;
d) The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the enclosed area
Cromwell Zoning Regulations I 8.25.2015
BUSINESS ZONES
75
shall be the minimum necessary and shall only be the parking
of vehicles, building access or limited storage. Access to the enclosed
area shall be the necessary to of
vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry
to the living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not be
used for human habitation or partitioned into separate rooms;
All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the BFE shall
be unfinished and resistant to flood damage.
f) Electrical, plumbing, HY AC ductwork, machinery or other utility
equipment and connections that service the structure (including, but not
limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps,
hot water heaters, ventilation, washers, dryers, electrical junction
boxes, circuit breaker boxes and food freezers) are prohibited in the
fully enclosed area below the BFE. Utilities or service equipment
located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the
space, will subject the structure to increased flood insurance
g) A residential building with a structurally attached garage having the floor
slab below the BFE is considered an enclosed area below the BFE and
must meet the standards of Sections 4.2.T4(a)-(f). A garage attached to
a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the
BFE, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters in both directions. Flood openings or vents are required in
the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage doors. The human
intervention necessary to open garage doors when flooding occurs is
not an acceptable means of meeting the openings requirements. In
addition to the automatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage
below BFE must be constructed with flood resistant materials. Garages
attached to non-residential structures must also meet the
aforementioned requirements or be dry floodproofed as per the
requirements of Section 4.2. T3.
5. Manufactured (Mobile) Homes and Recreational Vehicles (RVs).
(l) In all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), any manufactured (mobile) homes to
be newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result
of substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest floor is
at or above the base flood elevation (BFE). The manufactured home must also
meet all the construction standards per Section 4.2.Tl. This includes SFHAs
outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home
park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has
incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.
(2) All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be placed on a permanent
foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is
securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and
hydrostatic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
(3) All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be installed using methods
Cromwell Zoning Regulations I 8.25.2015
BUSINESS ZONES
76
and practices which mm1m1ze damage. Adequate access and drainage
should be provided. Elevation construction standards include foundations
no more than ten (I 0) feet and reinforcement is provided for
more than six ( 6) feet above ground
Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either:
a) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and
b) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, OR
c) meet all the general standard of Section 4.2.R and the elevation and
anchoring requirement of Section 4.2.T5( 1 ), 4.2.T5(2), and 4.2. T5(3).
(5) A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
4.2.U Flood ways.
Located within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are areas designated as floodways on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFM). Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has
erosion potential, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and repairs to
substantially damaged structures and other developments shall be permitted unless certification, with
supporting technical data, by a Connecticut licensed professional engineer is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood
discharge. Fences in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design. A permit may be
given which allows encroachments resulting in increases in base flood elevations provided the community first
obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the requirements of CFR. 44, Chapter I, Subsection 65 .12.
4.2.V Standards for Development in Areas of Shallow Flooding (Zones AO and AH).
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are areas designated as shallow flooding areas (AO
and AH Zones). These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate. In AO and AH zones, the following provisions apply:
1. For residential structures, all new construction, substantial improvements and repair to
structures that have sustained substantial damage shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM), in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least two (2) feet above the highest
adjacent grade.
2. For non-residential structures, all new construction, substantial improvements and repair to
structures that have sustained substantial damage shall:
(1) Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above the highest adjacent
grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement,
shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
(2) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood- proofed
to or above the depth number, in feet, specified on the FIRM above the highest
adjacent grade, or if no depth number is specified at least two (2) feet above the
Cromwell Zoning Regulations I 8.25.2015
BUSINESS ZONES
77
4.2.W
highest adjacent so that any space below that level is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to passage of water and with structural
components having the capability resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects buoyancy. Designs complying with requirement
must be certified by either a Connecticut licensed profossional engineer or
architect.
(3) On-site drainage for all proposed structures in AO and AH Zones located on slopes
shall provide adequate drainage paths to guide flood waters around and away
from such structures.
Permitted Uses in all Special Flood Hazard Areas.
The following uses are permitted in Special Flood Hazard Areas:
l. Farming (including grazing, crop, tree and truck farming, and other agricultural uses):
2. Recreation (including bathing places, boat ramps, docks, picnic areas, play fields. golf,

4. Dikes or other structures designed to divert or obstruct the flow of flood waters.
4.2. Y Special Permit Uses, Structures and Buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
1. There are Special Flood Hazard Areas within the Town of Cromwell which lie outside the
boundary of the Riparian Protection District. The use of land and erection of structures and
buildings for residential and other non-residential purposes may be permitted in Special
Flood Hazard Areas outside the Riparian Protection District subject to the granting of a
special permit as provided in Section 4.2.P. lf the proposal is subject to the provisions of
the Subdivision Regulations of the Town of Cromwell, a special permit is not required.
2. Uses that are permitted in a Zoning Use District may also be allowed in the Special Flood
Hazard Area which is located within the particular Zoning Use District.
4.2.Z Design Standards for Subdivision Proposals.
If a proposed subdivision, including the placement of a manufactured home park or subdivision, is located in a
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) the following requirements shall apply:
1. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
Cromwell Zoning Regulations I 8.25.2015
BUSINESS ZONES
78
shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
shall have adequate provided to reduce exposure to
[n all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available. the
applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis performed by a
Connecticut licensed professional engineer that generates BFEs for all subdivision
proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and
subdivisions. The Public Works Director shall require the applicant to provide BFE data for
all subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, as per
Section 4.2.Q 12.
4.2.AA Floodplain Variance Procedures.
1. The Zoning Board of Appeals, as established by the Town of Cromwell, shall hear and
decide appeals and requests for Floodplain Variances from the requirements of this
regulation.
2. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Public Works Director (or
his designee) in the enforcement or administration of this regulation.
3. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals or any person
owning land which abuts or is within a radius of l 00 feet of the land in question may
appeal within 15 days after such decision to the State Superior Court of Middlesex County,
as provided in Section 8-8 of the General Statutes of Connecticut.
4. The Public Works Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request.
4.2.BB Specific Situation Floodplain Variances.
1. Buildings on a Historic Register - Floodplain Variances may be issued for the
reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or any locally-adopted historic
district without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section and
provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not result in the
structure losing its historical designation.
2. Functionally Dependent Use or Facility - Floodplain Variances may be issued for new
construction and substantial improvements and other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use or facility provided the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage, creates no additional
threat to public safety and meet all of the requirements of Section 4.2DD.
3. Floodway Prohibition - Floodplain Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
4.2.CC Considerations For Granting Floodplain Variances.
1. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this regulation
and the items listed below as 4.2.CC2- 4.2.CC 12. Upon consideration of these factors and

The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands the injury
danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
4. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of
such damage on the individual owner;
5. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
6. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent
facility;
7. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the
proposed use;
8. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
9. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area;
10. The safety access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergencyvehicles;
11. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
12. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
4.2.DD Conditions for Floodplain Variances.
1. Floodplain Variances shall only be used upon a determination that the Floodplain Variance
is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance
of a historical building, a determination that the Floodplain Variances is the minimum
necessary as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building and result in the
loss of historic designation of the building. Floodplain Variances pertain to a piece of
property and are not personal in nature. A properly issued variance is granted for a parcel
of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the regulation
would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners.
Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels.
For example, economic or financial hardship is not sufficient cause for a Floodplain
Variance, nor are inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal
preferences or disapproval of one's neighbors.
2. Floodplain Variances shall only be used upon:
(1) a showing of good and sufficient cause,
(2) a determination that failure to grant the Floodplain Variance would result m
exceptional hardship, and;
(3) a determination that the granting of a Floodplain Variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisance, damage the rights or property values of other persons
in the area, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws, ordinances or regulations.
Cromwell Zoning Regulations j 8.25.2015
BUSINESS ZONES
80
hardships that are based on unusual or unique physical characteristics of the
property in question, characteristics that are not shared by adjacent parcels,
quality to meet subsection above. Claims of hardship based on the
structure, on economic gain or loss, or on personal or self-created circumstances
are not sufficient cause for the granting of a Floodplain Variance.
No Floodplain Variance may be issued within a regulatory floodway that will result in any
increase in the I 00-year flood levels. A variance may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvements and other development necessary for the conduct of a
·'functionally dependent use" provided that there is good and sufficient cause for providing
relief; and the Floodplain Variance does not cause a rise in the 100-year flood level within
a regulatory floodway. The structure and other development must be protected by methods
that minimize flood damages.
4. Any applicant to whom a Floodplain Variance is granted shall be given written notice that
the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base
flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation.
4.2.EE Floodplain Enforcement.
1. Each Special Flood Hazard Area Special Permit shall authorize, as a condition of approval,
the Public Works Director or designated agents to make regular inspections of the subject
property. The Public Works Director or designated agents are also authorized to inspect
any property in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) where it appears that violations of
these regulations may be taking place.
2. If the Public Works Director (or his designee) finds that any person is undertaking any
construction, substantial improvement, filling, or any other activity or maintaining a
condition which in violation of these regulations, the Public Works Director (or his
designee):
(1) Shall issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the subject
property owner, ordering that the activity cease and ordering the property owner
to either seed to obtain a Special Flood Hazard Area Special Permit prior to
continuing with the activity or, if appropriate, ordering that all violations and/or
obstructions be removed from the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
immediately.
(2) Notify the Building Official and Zoning Enforcement Officer and request that any
permit(s) in force be revoked or suspended and that a stop work order be issued.
(3) May suspend or revoke a Special Flood Hazard Area Special Permit if it is found
that the applicant has not complied with the terms, conditions or limitations set
forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of work as set forth in the
application including application plans. Prior to revoking any permit, the Public
Works Director (or his designee) shall issue notice to the permittee, personally
or by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct
which warrants the intended action.
(4) Failure to comply with any written order issued under this section shall be
considered a violation of these regulations and is subject to the penalties

Stormwater Runoff Control Plans.
Site plans shall be accompanied by plans, prepared by a registered Professional Engineer
licensed in the State of Connecticut, providing measures for detention and controlled
release of storm water runoff when, at least one (I) of the following is met:
(1) Proposed Commercial or Industrial Developments;
(2) Proposed residential developments of (3) acres or more (excluding single-family,
duplex or triplex residential construction, as part of a previously approved
building lot);
(3) The proposed impervious area is 50 percent or greater.
(4) Any other developments may be required to provide such measures if deemed
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, by the Commission
2. When required, measures for the detention and controlled release of stormwater runoff
shall meet the following standards:
(1) Infiltration. Maximum infiltration to the ground water is encouraged. Design of the
stormwater management system shall consider reducing runoff by use of such
techniques as minimizing impervious areas and maximizing travel times by
using grass or rock-lined channels in lieu of storm sewers, and the use of rain
gardens for roof surface drainage.
(2) Release rate shall not exceed the rate of runoff for the same site in its undeveloped
state for all intensities and durations of rainfall. This may be accomplished
through the use of, but not limited to, the following design elements:
a) detention basins,
b) retention ponds,
c) roof or parking lot storage or
d) other acceptable means.
3. Required volume for stormwater detention shall be calculated on the basis of runoff from a
2-year, 10-year, 25-year, 50-year and 100-year frequency rainfall, as published by the
National Weather Service, the Connecticut Stormwater Management Manual, or other
recognized agency. The detention volume required shall be that necessary to handle the
runoff of a 25-year frequency rain- fall, for any and all durations, from the proposed
development less that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release
rate as specified above.
4. In all cases, runoff shall be computed in accordance with Technical Release #55,
Engineering Division, Soil Conservation Service, USDA, January, 1975, as amended. The
Commission may allow alternate peak runoff modeling techniques.

6.6 REAR LOTS
6.6.A Purpose.
The purpose of this regulation is to enable the subdivision of existing lots of relatively large size which, due to
their limited frontage, could not otherwise be subdivided. The intent is to minimize the length of new road
construction and preserve open space or some other existing natural or cultural resource of the Town.
6.6.B Special Permit Required.
Rear Lots may be authorized as a Special Permit provided the use is allowed in the district, and the following
standards are met.
6.6.C General Requirements.
1. No lot shall be divided into more than two (2) rear lots.
2. Each rear lot shall have double the minimum front yard setback required for that zone,
measured from the lot line which intersects the accessway and is perpendicular to the
accessway.
3. Each rear lot shall have at least double the minimum lot size required for that zone.
4. Each rear lot shall contain a "buildable square" of not less than the minimum lot size for
that zone. "Buildable square" is an area of roughly equal length and width which contains
no wetlands or watercourses as defined in the Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-
38, as amended, and no slopes greater than 33 percent.
Cromwell Zoning Regulations I 8. 25.2015
SPECIAL PERMITS
154
6.6.D
No portion lot between the street and lot line which intersects the accessway shall
be counted toward the minimum lot size.
rear lot in a Residential District shall have an accessway which has a continuous
width of at least 20 feet, which is owned in fee simple by the owner of the rear lot. and
which has frontage on a street.
Each rear lot in an Industrial District shall have an accessway which has a continuous width
of at least 30 feet which is owned in fee simple by the owner of the rear lot, and which has
frontage on a street
8. Each rear lot shall comply with all other lot and building requirements for the zone in
which it is located;
9. No two (2) rear lots shall have frontage on the same street any closer to each other than the
minimum lot width for that zone, except that two contiguous rear lots may be approved
sharing a common driveway, and the application for such rear lots shall include an
Agreement specifying that the owners of said driveway will share responsibility for its
maintenance;
I 0. The Planning and Zoning Commission may require that slope rights on an adjacent
frontage lot be provided to accommodate driveway construction, and that a proposed rear
lot share a common driveway with an adjacent frontage lot where appropriate.
11. The owner of the proposed rear lot shall obtain a Special Permit before submitting an
application for subdivision approval of a proposed rear lot.
Special Consideration.
The public benefit of rear lots is their potential to result in a subdivision with shorter roads and preserved
natural or cultural resources. Therefore, the applicant shall show how each proposed rear lot in a subdivision of
three (3) or more lots will enable one ( 1) or more of the following benefits:
1. Allow for the preservation of some existing natural or cultural resource of the Town;
2. Reduce the length of a new road, new sanitary sewer service, or other municipal
infrastructure:
3. Provide some other benefit to the community.
6.6.E Special Administrative Provision.
4. When a rear lot is part of a subdivision proposed in accordance with the Cromwell
Subdivision Regulations, the applicant may submit a joint application for a rear lot with the
subdivision application.
5. The Cromwell Planning and Zoning Commission should vote on the special permit
application separate from the subdivision application.
6.7 CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS
6.7.A Purpose.
The goals of these regulations are any of the following:

of the residents of the Town of Cromwell.
promote development of land in a way which is sensitive to the natural and cultural
environment, preserving important wetlands systems, farmland of local significance, and/or
areas containing significant natural features such as unusual terrain, vegetation, wildlife,
scenic vistas.
6.7.B Applicability.
l. This regulation shall apply to any parcel or adjacent parcels under the same ownership that
comprises 15 or more contiguous acres in a Residential District.
2. Parcels comprising less than 15 acres in a Residential District may, at the owner's request
and subject to a Special Permit from the Commission, be developed as a Conservation
Subdivision.

the total parcel) be deeded to the Town for active or passive recreation use.
6. Where property to be developed as a Conservation Subdivision abuts other residentially
zoned property, the Conservation Subdivision shall be landscaped in such a manner as to
provide a screen or other suitable transition to lessen the visual impact of the Conservation
Subdivision, if any. The minimum width of any required landscape buffer area shall be not
less than 25 feet. The Commission shall review the proposed landscape buffer as part of its
Special Permit review. The landscape buffer requirement is intended to apply only at
Potential Development Areas of a Conservation Subdivision, and not to any area to be
preserved as open space.

1. The method chosen to preserve open space from future development shall be proposed by
the applicant during the special permit approval process and shall be approved or rejected
by the Commission at its discretion.
2. If a proposed method of open space preservation is rejected by the Commission, the
Commission may then determine an alternate method of preservation.
3. The applicant shall indicate his preference, at the time of the special permit application, as
to how the open space is to be maintained and preserved from development and shall
