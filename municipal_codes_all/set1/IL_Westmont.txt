PREFACE 
    This volume is a republication of the 1996 Code of the Village of Westmont, Illinois. The original 
arrangement and the original numbering system have been retained. 
    Ordinances through Ordinance No. 99-170, adopted December 20, 1999, have been included in this 
republication. 
    The following paragraphs are reprinted from the preface of the 1996 Code: 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the 
Village of Westmont, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through 
June 15, 1992, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of trustees. The source of each 
section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a 
note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By 
use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item 
in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and 
Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given 
to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mrs. Virginia Szymski, Village Clerk, Steve Penczak, Deputy Village 
Clerk, and Mr. John Zemenak, Village Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress 
of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a 
Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and 
which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Sec. 2-64. - Electronic attendance at meetings rules. 
(a) ?Rules statement. It is the decision of the Village of Westmont that any member of the corporate 
authorities may attend via electronic means (such as by telephone, video or internet connection) any 
regular or special open meeting of the corporate authorities convened pursuant to properly published 
notice at which a quorum is present, including workshop meetings of the corporate authorities, but 
not including committee meetings, provided that such attendance is in compliance with these rules 
and any applicable laws. Electronic attendance at closed meetings by a member of the corporate 
authorities is not permitted. 
(b) ?Prerequisites. A member of the corporate authorities may attend a meeting electronically if the 
member meets the following conditions: 
(1) ?The member shall notify the village manager at least 48 hours in advance of the scheduled 
meeting so that necessary communications equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the 
necessary technical arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance. The 
request for electronic attendance shall be made using the attached request written form, which 
should be submitted to the village manager at least 48 hours in advance of the scheduled 
meeting. In the event advanced transmission of the written request form is impossible, the 
request to attend a meeting remotely and electronically shall be otherwise communicated to the 
village manager at least 48 hours prior to the start of the meeting. Thereafter, within 48 hours 
following the meeting, such written request form shall be submitted to the village manager. 
(2) ?The member must assert one of the following three reasons why he or she is unable to 
physically attend the meeting: 
a. ?The member cannot attend because of personal illness or disability; or 
b. ?The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the business of the 
Village of Westmont; or 
c. ?The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency. 
(c) ?Authorization to participate. 
(1) ?The village manager, after receiving the electronic attendance request, shall inform the 
corporate authorities of the request for electronic attendance. 
(2) ?After establishing that there is a quorum is physically present at a meeting where a member of 
the corporate authorities desires to attend electronically, the presiding officer shall state that (i) 
a notice was received by a member of the corporate authorities in accordance with these rules, 
and (ii) the member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a 
motion objecting to the member's electronic attendance is made, seconded, and approved by 
2/3 of the members of the corporate authorities who are physically present at the meeting. If no 
such motion is made and seconded or if any such motion fails to achieve the required vote by 
the members of the corporate authorities physically present at the meeting, then the request by 
the member to attend the meeting electronically shall be deemed approved and the presiding 
officer shall declare the requesting member present. After such declaration by the presiding 
officer, the question of a member's electronic attendance may not be reconsidered. 
(3) ?Only one member of the corporate authorities may attend a meeting electronically at any one 
time. In the event more than one member requests remote attendance at a specific meeting, 
selection shall be made by the village manager based upon the first request received by the 
village manager. 
(4) ?A trustee attending a meeting electronically shall be entitled to receive his or her regular 
compensation for that meeting. 
(d) ?Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically and other members of the 
corporate authorities must be able to communicate effectively, and members of the audience must 
be able to hear all communications at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any 
meeting, the village, by proper authorization, shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this 
objective at the meeting site. 
(e) ?Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an off-site attendee and counted 
as present electronically for that meeting if the member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes 
shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member is physically present or present by 
electronic means. 
(f) ?Rights of remote member. 
(1) ?A member permitted to attend electronically will be able to express his or her comments during 
the meeting and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject 
to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to. 
(2) ?The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote 
taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically shall be called during any 
vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the clerk and placed in the minutes for 
the corresponding meeting. 
(3) ?A member attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any 
member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving and 
returning. 
(4) ?A member of the corporate authorities is eligible to use this procedure and may attend 
electronically no more than three times per fiscal year. 
(g) ?Committees, boards and commissions. These rules shall not apply to any committees, boards and 
commissions established by authority of the Village of Westmont.

State Law reference Pecuniary interest in contracts, 65 ILCS 5/4-8-6. 


Sec. 2-536. - Declaration of policy. 
    The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be 
independent, impartial, and responsible to the people they serve; that government decisions and policies 
be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal 
gain or to advance the interest of a family or relatives; and that the public have confidence in the integrity 
of its government. In recognition of these goals there is established this code of ethics for all village public 
officials, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, and for all village employees. 
(Ord. No. 99-130, § 1(2-300), 9-20-1999) 


Sec. 2-537. - Purposes. 
    The purpose of this code of ethics is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all village public 
officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions which are incompatible with the best interest 
of the village and its inhabitants. This code of ethics is founded upon the principle that no individual 
should receive any financial or other gain beyond that legally defined by reason of serving as a public 
official or employee of the village, and that no private party or taxpayer, including public officials or 
employees or their family members, should receive any benefit from village action beyond that which is 
available to any other private party or taxpayer due to their relation to or as a result of privileged 
information or support provided by any public officials or employees.

impose disciplinary action and/or fines for violations as it deems appropriate.

than one-half of one percent of the publicly traded stock of a business entity realizing such a

responsibilities. 
(f) ?Misrepresentation of village positions. No public official or employee shall state that the village has 
made a particular decision or adopted a position when such public official or employee knows that 
the village has in fact not duly made or adopted such decision or position. This subsection shall not 
be construed to prohibit any public official or employee from stating his personal views concerning 
any matter so long as such views are clearly identified as personal views and not as the official 
decision or position of the village. 
(g) ?Appearance. Except as otherwise provided by law, no public official or employee shall appear on 
behalf of any private person or business entity, other than himself or a family member:

of any transaction that is pending before the village or in which an interest of the village is

without compensation by a public official on behalf of his constituents in the course of such public official's 
duties as a representative of such constituents, or in the discharge of such public official's public or civil 
obligations, or to prohibit an appearance by a public official or employee as a duly authorized

ethics shall be made, in writing, to the ethics officer. Upon the receipt of any complaint, the ethics 
officer shall immediately forward the complaint to the ethics board and may recommend disciplinary 
action to the ethics board. The ethics board shall thereafter schedule a special meeting convened to 
consider the alleged violation of this code of ethics pursuant to the procedures described in this 
section. The ethics board shall provide at least seven days' advance written notice to the alleged 
violator of the date and location of the special meeting. The ethics board shall convene this special 
meeting within 45 days after receiving a written complaint forwarded to it by the ethics officer. An 
emergency meeting of the ethics board may be called by the village president or by any three

this code of ethics may be fined not more than $5,000.00 for each such offense. In cases of a

$5,000.00. 
(e) ?Appeals. Any public official or employee found guilty by the ethics board of violating this code of 
ethics may appeal such decision to any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or make any such 
other appeals as provided by state law and due process requirements. Any such appeal shall not 
stay any disciplinary action ordered by the ethics board unless so directed by a court or tribunal of 
competent jurisdiction.

village in which any public official or employee has an interest prohibited by this code of ethics, or

Sec. 2-546. - Whistleblower reporting policy. 
(a) ?Purpose. The village has adopted, by reference, the Illinois Whistleblower Act and the False Claims 
Act which are comprehensive statutes designed to expose the fraudulent actions of employees, 
politicians and contractors in connection with government obligations, resources and employment by 
encouraging the reporting of such fraudulent behavior. The reporting of concerns of illegal or 
dishonest or fraudulent activity promotes open government, protects the health, safety and welfare 
and improves the community. However, it is understood that baseless allegations are subject to 
discipline, up to and including termination. 
(b) ?Policy. A whistleblower is an employee of the village who reports an activity that he/she considers to 
be illegal or dishonest or designed to deceive others, resulting in the village suffering a loss and/or 
the perpetrator achieving a gain. The whistleblower acts in good faith and has reasonable grounds 
for believing the information disclosed provides evidence of an improper transaction or a violation of 
the law or the policies and ordinances of the village. 
    Examples of illegal or dishonest activities are violations of federal, state or local laws, billing for 
services not performed or for goods not delivered and other fraudulent activity. 
(c) ?Procedure. If an employee has knowledge of or a concern of illegal or dishonest fraudulent activity, 
the employee may contact one of the following to discuss the situation and evidence: 
 ?His/her immediate supervisor. 
 ?Human resources administrator. 
 ?Village manager. 
 ?Illinois state police at (271) 785-4377.

    Alternatively, a written complaint may be submitted to any of the above. The reporting employee 
must exercise sound judgment to avoid baseless allegations. Making allegations maliciously, recklessly or 
with the foreknowledge that the allegations were false is a serious offense and may result in discipline 
and/or penalties as provided in Illinois law or in the policies of the village. 
    Once a complaint is made, the human resources administrator will gather information or conduct an 
investigation, unless the complaint is regarding the human resources administrator. The human resources 
administrator may enlist the assistance of police department personnel for investigative purposes. In the 
event that the human resources administrator is the target, then the chief of police or chief's designee 
may investigate the complaint. Either the chief/chief's designee or the human resources administrator 
may request assistance from an accountant or auditor, if deemed appropriate. 
    The complaint and information gathered pursuant to the complaint will be kept confidential except as 
needed to complete the investigation, resolve the complaint, comply with applicable law or otherwise 
properly inform and receive feedback from the board of trustees or legal counsel. 
    The investigation shall begin as soon as practicable after a complaint is lodged and shall conclude 
as expeditiously as possible. The village manager will make a report to the board of trustees within 14 
days of the complaint or at the next available village board meeting. Once the investigation is completed, 
the findings, along with a recommendation made in consultation between legal counsel and the village 
manager, will be reduced to writing and submitted to the board of trustees. 
    The finding may be placed in a personnel file and disseminated if it is determined to be appropriate 
to do so. The finding may lead to disciplinary action on the part of the village as defined the village's 
Personnel Code. 
    This complaint procedure shall not be construed to create any independent right to any specific 
remedy or to a hearing.

public improvement project shall only be awarded if approved by a vote of two-thirds of the village

and similarly files, within ten days of the election of any additional member, such member's name and 
address; and provided that its affairs and management are conducted by a board of directors, executive 
committee or similar body chosen by the members at their annual meeting, and that no member or any 
officer, agent or employee of the club is paid, or directly receives, in the form of salary or other 
compensation any profits from the distribution or sale of alcoholic liquor to the club or its members or its 
guests introduced by members, beyond the amount of such salary as may be fixed and voted at any 
annual meeting by the members or by its board of directors or other governing body, out of the general 
revenue of the club. 
    Hotel means a building or group of buildings and facilities used in conjunction with one another, kept,

consumption on the premises; 
(2) ?Any class 11 or class 12 license for a special event may include specific permission to sell

sufficient to constitute such premises a restaurant within the meaning of this definition, it being the intent 
of this definition that the primary business conducted on premises to be licensed as restaurants under this

(b) ?Proration. 
(1) ?Prior to receiving the license, the licensee shall then pay a sum representing the initial license 
fee plus the annual license fee based upon the number of parital months remaining in the year 
in which the licensee pays the initial license fee (prorated license fee). The proration of the 
annual license fee shall occur only in the year in which the licensee pays the initial license fee, 
and there shall be no other prorations or refunds. The liquor license fee proration schedule is 
incorporated in appendix C to this Code. 
(2) ?There shall be no refund or proration of the initial license fee except as set forth in subsection 
(b)(1) of this section. There shall be no refund or proration of the annual license fee for any 
portion of a year during which any licensee ceases to engage in the business of selling alcoholic 
liquor. 
(c) ?Due date for annual fee. The annual fee for a license issued under this chapter shall be due and 
payable on or before January 1 of each year. No licensee shall continue to engage in the business of 
selling alcoholic liquor unless such fee has been paid. 
(d) ?Payment of initial fee. All initial license fees required by this chapter shall be paid to the village 
treasurer in cash or by certified or cashier's check, at the time of issuance of the license, after 
approval of the local liquor commissioner, and of the village board if required pursuant to section 10-
34. 
(e) ?Review and adjustment of fees. It is the intention of the village to review and, if justified, adjust 
license fees periodically based upon the costs and expenses incurred by the village to administer 
this chapter; provided, however, that nothing in this provision shall require such review nor impair or 
prohibit any adjustment in fees as may from time to time be approved by the village board. 
(f) ?Fee to obtain license of a more expensive classification. One-half of the designated initial license fee 
shall be charged to any existing licensee who wishes to obtain a license of a more expensive 
classification in substitution for its existing license under this chapter. The existing licensee shall 
complete a new application for this license, however, the background check shall be waived if the 
ownership and management information is unchanged from the most recent information approved 
the village for the licensee. The application fee shall be waived for this request. 
(g) ?Reduction of initial fee. One-half the designated initial license fee under this chapter shall be 
charged to any applicant for a license for an existing business who seeks a license of the same or a 
more restrictive classification as that of the existing business.

Sec. 10-42. - Change in personnel. 
(a) ?The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall be deemed to constitute a change 
in ownership of licensed businesses for which a new license under this chapter shall be required: 
(1) ?With respect to any licensee that is a corporation, the replacement or addition of any 
shareholder owning directly or indirectly, including ownership by members of the same 
household, 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares of any class of the capital stock of 
such corporation; provided that any sale or exchange of stock which results in a change in 
controlling ownership under the bylaws of the corporation shall be deemed to be a change of 
ownership under this chapter regardless of the percentage of actual sale or exchange; 
(2) ?With respect to any licensee that is a general partnership, the replacement or addition of any 
general partner; 
(3) ?With respect to any licensee that is a limited partnership, the replacement or addition of any 
general partner or of any limited partner holding directly or indirectly, including ownership by 
members of the same household, 20 percent or more interest in the earnings of such limited 
partnership; 
(4) ?With respect to any licensee that is a limited liability company, the replacement or addition of 
any manager or of any member holding directly or indirectly, including ownership by members 
of the same household, 20 percent or more interest in the earnings of such company; 
(5) ?The operation of a licensed business by an unlicensed individual or corporation under a 
management agreement which permits such unlicensed individual or corporation to control and 
direct the operation of the business, to retain all or a majority of the profits derived from such 
business, and to utilize the privileges of the liquor license issued to another for such business 
for any period in excess of 90 days. A management agreement shall not be deemed to include 
a contract for employment between a licensee and an individual manager who operates the 
licensed business on behalf of or at the direction of the licensee. 
(b) ?At least 90 days prior to any of the events described in subsection (a) of this section as constituting 
a change of ownership, the licensee shall apply for a new license pursuant to the requirements of 
section 10-32. With respect to a change of ownership of a corporation, limited liability company or 
limited partnership of more than 20 percent but less than 100 percent, or with respect to the 
replacement or addition of any general partner for a general partnership, the licensee shall pay a 
percentage of the initial license fee with respect to the new license which equals the percentage 
change in ownership. With respect to a 100 percent change of ownership of any entity or individual 
or with respect to a change of ownership under subsection (a)(5) of this section, the licensee shall 
pay 100 percent of the initial license fee with respect to the new license. The local liquor 
commissioner shall act promptly thereon; however, the licensee shall not conduct its business 
following any change of ownership as defined in this section until a new license has been issued. 
(c) ?Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the local liquor 
commissioner may, in his discretion, and upon the approval of the village board, issue a temporary 
liquor license to a person who has applied for a new liquor license for an existing licensed business 
for which there is a change of ownership as defined in subsection (a) of this section. Such temporary 
license shall permit the applicant to operate such business pending the processing of its application 
for a new license. Such a temporary license may be issued only subject to the following conditions: 
(1) ?A completed application for a new liquor license must be on file with the liquor commissioner. 
(2) ?Each officer and manager of the applicant shall file a sworn affidavit of eligibility, stating that 
such officer or manager meets all of the requirements for issuance of a liquor license as 
provided in section 10-33. 
(3) ?The liquor control commissioner may impose such terms and conditions on the issuance of the 
temporary license as are necessary and desirable to ensure compliance with all provisions of 
this chapter. 
(4) ?A temporary license shall only be issued for a period not to exceed 90 days; provided that such 
temporary license shall automatically terminate upon issuance or denial of a liquor license by 
the local liquor commissioner after full review and processing of the application therefor, and 
further provided that only one such temporary license shall be issued per applicant. 
(5) ?The fee for a temporary license shall be 25 percent of the annual license fee for a liquor license 
of the classification applied for, which fee shall be nonrefundable; provided that, if the local 
liquor commissioner determines to issue a liquor license, after full review and processing of the 
application therefor, the annual fee for such license shall be reduced by the amount already 
paid for the temporary license. 
(6) ?The applicant shall be responsible for any and all penalties which may be imposed for 
violations of this chapter, as provided by article V of this chapter. 
(7) ?Issuance of a temporary license under this section shall not guarantee issuance of a liquor 
license to the applicant at the end of the temporary license period, and the liquor commissioner 
shall have the right to grant or deny any liquor license based on the standards for issuance of 
liquor licenses as set forth in this chapter, including the truth of statements made in the 
application or, in the case of a temporary license issued pursuant to this section, the truth of 
statements made in an affidavit of eligibility by any officer or manager of the applicant. 
(d) ?The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute a change in ownership of 
licensed businesses for which a new license shall be required, but shall not be subject to the 
application requirements established in section 10-32. The fee for any change in ownership shall be 
$150.00 for each applicant or new owner so long as the change in total ownership is between five 
percent and 19 percent. Within five business days following any change described in this subsection, 
the licensee shall notify the local liquor commissioner in writing describing the event in detail: 
(1) ?With respect to any licensee that is a corporation, the replacement or addition of any officer or 
director of such corporation or any shareholder owning directly or indirectly, including ownership 
by members of the same household, more than five percent but less than 20 percent of the 
outstanding shares of any class of the capital stock of such corporation; 
(2) ?With respect to any licensee that is a limited partnership, the replacement or addition of any 
limited partner holding directly or indirectly, including ownership by members of the same 
household, more than a five percent but less than a 20 percent interest in the earnings of such 
limited partnership; 
(3) ?With respect to any licensee that is a limited liability company, the replacement or addition of 
any member or manager holding directly or indirectly, including ownership by members within 
the same household, more than a five percent but less than a 20 percent interest in the 
earnings of such company. 
Failure to give the notice required in this section shall constitute a violation of this chapter subjecting the 
licensee to revocation or suspension of the license. No additional license fee shall be payable for a new 
license required by virtue of changes described in this subsection, and so long as an application therefor 
is pending and not yet acted upon by the local liquor commissioner, the applicant may continue to 
conduct its business and operations under the license in effect immediately prior to such changes. 
(e) ?Within ten days of any change of manager or agent conducting business for a licensee under this 
chapter, the licensee shall report such change to the local liquor commissioner in writing and shall 
provide information concerning such manager or agent as required in section 10-32(a)(9). A fee of 
$150.00 shall be paid in conjunction with any such change of manager. 
(f) ?All new personnel shall meet all the standards of this chapter and must otherwise qualify to hold a 
liquor license. All such changes in personnel shall be subject to review by the local liquor 
commissioner, and if any new officer, shareholder, partner or manager is ineligible for a license, the 
license shall terminate. 
(g) ?A person convicted of a violation of the requirements established in this section shall be subject to a 
fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00; provided, however, that nothing herein shall 
preclude the right of the local liquor commissioner to suspend or revoke the license, or impose a fine, 
pursuant to the provisions of section 10-142.

Sec. 10-43. - Change of location. 
    A retail liquor dealer's license shall permit the sale of alcoholic liquor only in the premises described 
in the application for the license. Such location may be changed only upon written permission to make 
such change issued by the local liquor commissioner, upon consideration of a floor plan as required upon 
initial application. No change of location shall be permitted unless the proposed new location is a proper 
one for the retail sale of alcoholic liquor under the laws of the state and the ordinances of the village. The 
fee for permission for a change of location shall be $1,000.00. No additional license fee shall be payable 
but a new license shall be issued to reflect the new location. 
(Ord. No. 94-68, § 1(4-16), 9-20-1994) 


Sec. 10-44. - Change in floor plan or focus of local operation. 
(a) ?During the term of any license issued for the sale of alcoholic liquor for consumption on the 
premises, if a licensee proposes to make any change which would alter its operation from the 
conditions pursuant to which the license was initially granted, including any change in any required 
floor plan or in the type and focus of the theme, decor, motif, advertising or menu for the licensed 
business in any manner which would promote the sale of alcoholic liquor or of the entertainment 
available on the premises, as opposed to the availability of food service, or which would change the 
ratio of alcohol sales to other activities on the licensed premises by more than ten percent, the 
licensee shall apply in writing to the local liquor commissioner for approval of such changes, and 
provide information concerning the specific changes proposed, including a revised floor plan, if any. 
(b) ?Upon receipt of a request for approval of any of the changes as provided in subsection (a) of this 
section, the local liquor commissioner shall review the licensee's proposed changes to determine the 
nature and significance of the changes in consideration of the classification of license held and the 
requirements established for such classification, including the minimum number of seats required. 
The local liquor commissioner may approve the proposed changes if it is determined that the 
proposed changes in the floor plan, the nature and focus of the operation, the menu, the type and 
focus of advertising for the licensed business, and the ratio of alcohol sales to other activities on the 
premises are not so substantial as to make questionable the continued conformance of the licensed 
premises with the requirements of this chapter for the license classification applicable, and if the 
minimum number of required seats for such classification is provided. If it is determined that the 
proposed changes are substantial, the local liquor commissioner shall notify the licensee in writing 
that the changes are so substantial as to make questionable the continued conformance of the 
licensed premises with the requirements of this chapter for the license classification, including the 
minimum number of required seats, and that such changes will not be permitted. 
(c) ?The fee for any application request for approval of changes on licensed premises as provided in 
subsection (a) of this section shall be $500.00. No additional license fee shall be payable and no 
new license shall be required by virtue of the changes described in subsection (a) of this section. 
(d) ?So long as an application for approval of any of the changes described in subsection (a) of this 
section is pending, and not yet acted upon by the local liquor commissioner, the applicant may 
continue to conduct its business and operations in the manner approved at the time the license was 
initially granted. If approval of the proposed changes is granted, the licensee may proceed to 
implement such changes in accordance with the approval granted, and subject to any conditions 
which may be established as part of such approval. If approval is denied, the licensee shall continue 
to operate its business in the manner approved at the time the license was initially granted. 
(e) ?Any licensed business which implements any of the changes on licensed premises as provided in 
subsection (a) of this section without requesting and receiving approval of the local liquor 
commissioner as provided therein, shall be subject to penalties for violation of this chapter, as 
established in article V of this chapter, up to and including revocation of the license.

licensee is then entitled to receive a license, and that the premises for which such renewal license is 
sought are suitable for such purpose. Application for renewal shall be made on forms as provided in 
section 10-32. Any license issued pursuant to this chapter shall terminate by operation of law if not 
renewed within ten days after the date of its expiration. Thereafter, the licensee may apply for reissuance, 
consideration of which application shall be made pursuant to the procedures established by section 10-
34. In order to assure eligibility to renew the license, the licensee shall certify to the continued compliance 
of the premises with the conditions pursuant to which the license was initially granted, including the floor 
plan which was approved as part of the initial licensing. The privilege of renewal shall not be construed as 
a vested right, and nothing in this section shall prevent the village board from reducing the available 
licenses in any license classification.

circumstances beyond the control of the permittee. 
    Before work can be resumed, a new permit shall be obtained to do so, and the fee shall be based 
upon the unfinished portion of the project, provided no changes have been made in the original plans and 
specifications for such work.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 


Sec. 19-1. - General purpose and intent. 
    It is concluded that equity ownership of multiple-family dwellings and office units is a positive 
development for the Village of Westmont (the "village") and, within certain limits, such ownership should 
be encouraged. Because of the unique nature of condominium ownership and the age of the existing 
multiple-family dwelling and office unit stock in the village, it is further concluded that the quality of 
housing and office units and the rights of the condominium purchaser should be protected to a greater 
extent than the protections provided under existing laws. To this end, the village has the authority to 
introduce regulation into the condominium process, as provided in the Condominium Property Act, 765 
ILCS 605/1 et seq. 
    Based on the foregoing, the purpose and intent of this chapter is to introduce regulatory elements 
into the condominium conversion process that protect the rights of condominium purchasers and preserve 
and improve the quality of housing and office units in an effort to encourage orderly development of the 
condominium concept within the village. Further, this chapter is intended to facilitate code inspections by 
the village and, thus, to reduce the possibility of a condominium containing material defects that would 
have an adverse effect on the health, safety and welfare of its occupants or neighboring property, or 
would place unexpected burdens on condominium unit buyers.

bookstores; and 
"WHEREAS, the Village merely hopes to make perfectly explicit in its ordinances that the sale of the 
above-noted items constitutes an adult use; and 
"WHEREAS, the effort to amend the adult use ordinance will not change the Village's present 
interpretation of Section 22-781 as it pertains to adult bookstores such as the one which was the subject 
of the debate noted above; and 
"WHEREAS, the Mayor and Village Board have acted jointly to respond to the allegations of the 
prospective business owner and they are continuing to act Jointly based upon the evidence presented to 
the Zoning and Planning Commission and other relevant hearings; and

Editor's note Section 1 of Ord. No. 97-55, adopted July 7, 1997, amended ch. 34, art. II by adding 
thereto provisions designated as div. 1, §§ 34-3134-49. Prior to such amendment, ch. 34, art. II 
pertained to flood control and derived from ch. 7 of the 1972 Code, as amended. 


Sec. 34-31. - Purpose. 
    This article is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this village by 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-
12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8 and 5/11-31-2. The purpose of this article is to maintain this village's eligibility 
in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding, including 
loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental 
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, 
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance 
the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of 
water and related land resources. This article is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific 
purposes: 
(1) ?To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/18g, the Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act; 
(2) ?To ensure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazard to others, or 
create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(3) ?To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage; 
(4) ?To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding; 
(5) ?To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood damaged public 
facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations; 
(6) ?To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the village by fulfilling the 
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); 
(7) ?To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 
44 CFR 59-79, as amended; 
(8) ?To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(9) ?To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order 
to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect 
aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and 
enhance community and economic development; and 
(10) ?To provide for the orderly growth and development of an environment that is especially 
sensitive to changes from human activity. 
(Ord. No. 97-55, § 1, 7-7-1997) 


Sec. 34-32. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following definitions are adopted: 
    Act means an act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the State of Illinois, 
615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. 
    Applicant means any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application. 
    Appropriate use means only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and will be 
considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are as specified in section 34-40(c). 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent probability of being equaled or exceeded in any 
given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood. If the 100-year flood information is not 
available, the base flood shall be the flood of record. The base flood elevation at any location is as 
defined in section 34-38. 
    Building means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The 
term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term 
also includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than 180 days, 
unless fully licensed and ready for highway use. 
    Bypass channel means a channel formed in the topography of the surface of the earth to carry 
stormwater runoff through or around a specific area. 
    Channel means any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded area, 
flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully, ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway which 
has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface water or groundwater flows, either 
perennially or intermittently. 
    Channel modification means alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimensions or 
materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes damming, riprapping (or other armoring), 
widening, deepening, straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the 
bottom or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation, debris, 
or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form of channel modification involving a significant 
change in the channel cross section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g., 
straightening). 
    Compensatory storage means an artificially excavated hydraulically equivalent volume of storage 
within the special flood hazard area used to balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when 
artificial fill or structures are placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain 
storage can increase off-site floodwater elevations and flows, and this is prohibited. 
    Conditional approval of a designated floodway map change means preconstruction approval by 
IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval, 
pursuant to this article, gives assurances to the property owner that, once an appropriate use is 
constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon 
review and acceptance of as-built plans. 
    Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) means a letter which indicates that FEMA will revise 
base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodways as shown on an 
effective flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map, once the as-built plans are submitted 
and approved. 
    Control structure means a structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes through the 
structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface elevation. 
    Dam means all obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their abutments and 
appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing or diverting water or creating a pool. 
Underground water storage tanks are not included. 
    Designated floodway means the channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the 
floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store 
and convey the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than 0.1 foot increase in stage 
due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent increase in velocities. 
(1) ?The floodways are designated for St. Joseph's Creek and St. Joseph's Creek Tributary on the 
flood boundary and floodway map prepared by FEMA and dated January 16, 1981, and 
according to the best data available to IDNR/OWR and the village. When two floodway maps 
exist for a waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit shall prevail. 
(2) ?The floodways for those parts of unincorporated DuPage County that are within the 
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village that may be annexed into the village are designated for 
St. Joseph's Creek and St. Joseph's Creek Tributary on the flood boundary and floodway map 
prepared by FEMA and dated April 15, 1982. 
(3) ?To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway boundary 
should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located on a site plan, using reference 
marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of 
the designated floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation. 
    Development means any manmade change to real estate including: 
(1) ?Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a building or any addition to a building; 
(2) ?Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home, or 
installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days. If the travel 
trailer or recreational vehicle is on a site for less than 180 days, it must be fully licensed and 
ready for highway use; 
(3) ?Drilling, mining, installing utilities or facilities, construction of roads, bridges, parking lots, curb 
and gutter, or similar projects; 
(4) ?Demolition of a structure or redevelopment of a site; 
(5) ?Clearing of land as an adjunct of construction; 
(6) ?Construction or erection of levees, walls, fences, dams, or culverts; channel modifications; 
filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving or other non-agricultural alterations of the ground 
surface; storage of materials; or deposit of solid or liquid waste; and 
(7) ?Any other activity of man that might change the direction, height, or velocity of floodwater or 
surface water, including extensive vegetation removal. 
Development does not include maintenance of existing buildings and facilities such as re-roofing or 
resurfacing of roads when there is no increase in elevation, or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural 
practices that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.

    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional 
sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the 
pouring of concrete pads). 
    FEMA means the Federal Emergency Management Agency and its regulations at 44 CFR 59-79 
effective as of September 29, 1989. This incorporation does not include any later editions or 
amendments. 
    Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry 
land areas from overflow of inland or tidal waves, or the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of 
surface waters from any source. 
    Flood frequency means a period of years, based on a statistical analysis, during which a flood of a 
stated magnitude may be expected to be equaled or exceeded. 
    Flood fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the designated floodway. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means a map prepared by FEMA that depicts the special flood 
hazard area within a community. This map includes insurance rate zones and floodplains and may or may 
not depict floodways.

plus one foot of freeboard at any given location in the special flood hazard area. 
    Floodplain means that land typically adjacent to a body of water with ground surface elevations at or 
below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood elevation. Floodplains may also include detached 
special flood hazard areas, ponding areas, etc. The floodplain is also known as the special flood hazard 
area (SFHA). 
(1) ?The floodplains are those lands within the jurisdiction of the village that are subject to 
inundation by the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The special flood hazard areas of the 
village are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map of the village prepared 
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated January 16, 1981. The locations of 
additional special flood hazard areas not indicated on the flood insurance rate map of the 
village, but known historically to flood, are available in the public works director's office, and a 
majority of these are shown on the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Atlas No. 86, 
Floods in Hinsdale Quadrangle, Illinois. 
(2) ?The special flood hazard areas of those parts of unincorporated DuPage County that are within 
the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village are generally 
identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for the county by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and dated April 15, 1982. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or 
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real 
property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodproofing certificate means a form published by FEMA that is used to certify that a building has 
been designed and constructed to be structurally dry floodproofed to the flood protection elevation. 
    Freeboard means an increment of elevation added to the base flood elevation to provide a factor of 
safety for uncertainties in calculations, future watershed development, unknown localized conditions, 
wave actions and unpredictable effects such as those caused by ice or debris jams. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1) ?Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or preliminarily determined by the 
Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National 
Register; 
(2) ?Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the

not include a recreational vehicle. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into 
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Mitigation includes those measures necessary to minimize the negative effects which floodplain 
development activities might have on the public health, safety and welfare. Examples of mitigation include 
compensatory storage, soil erosion and sedimentation control, and channel restoration. Mitigation may 
also include those activities taken to reduce a structure's susceptibility to flooding. 
    Natural, when used in reference to channels, means those channels formed by the existing surface 
topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A natural stream tends to follow a meandering 
path; its floodplain is not constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or 
cultivated; and the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the area with no substantial 
alteration of the course or cross section of the stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel 
may regain some natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is 
reestablished. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural conditions by man through 
regrading and revegetation. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for 
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be

or prevention of terrestrial vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized 
characteristics. 
    Public bodies of water means all open public streams and lakes capable of being navigated by 
watercraft, in whole or in part, for commercial uses and purposes, and all lakes, rivers, and streams which 
in their natural condition were capable of being improved and made navigable, or that are connected with 
or discharge their waters into navigable lakes or rivers within or upon the borders of the state, together 
with all bayous, sloughs, backwaters, and submerged lands that are open to the main channel or body of 
water directly accessible thereto. 
    Public flood control project means a flood control project which will be operated and maintained by a 
public agency to reduce flood damages to existing buildings and structures which includes a hydrologic 
and hydraulic study of the existing and proposed conditions of the watershed. Nothing in this definition 
shall preclude the design, engineering, construction or financing, in whole or in part, of a flood control 
project by persons who are not public agencies.

    Repair, remodeling or maintenance means development activities which do not result in any 
increases in the outside dimensions of a building or any changes to the dimensions of a structure. 
    Retention/detention facility. A retention facility stores stormwater runoff without a gravity release. A 
detention facility provides for storage of stormwater runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and 
after a flood or storm. 
    Riverine special flood hazard area means any special flood hazard area subject to flooding from a 
river, creek, intermittent stream, ditch, on-stream lake system or any other identified channel. This term 
does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes, ponding areas, areas of sheet flow, or other areas 
not subject to overbank flooding. 
    Runoff means the water derived from melting snow or rain falling on the land surface, flowing over 
the surface of the ground or collected in channels or conduits. 
    Sedimentation means the processes that deposit soils, debris, and other materials either on other 
ground surfaces or in bodies of water or watercourses. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) means any base flood area subject to flooding from a river, creek, 
intermittent stream, ditch or any other identified channel or ponding and shown on a flood hazard 
boundary map or flood insurance rate map as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, VO, V30, VE, V, M, E, D, 
or X. 
    Stormwater storage area means an area that naturally or artificially serves to store excess 
stormwater. 
    Structure means the results of a manmade change to the land constructed on or below the ground, 
including the construction, reconstruction or placement of a building or any addition to a building, 
installing a manufactured home on a site, or preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a 
travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days unless they are fully licensed and ready for highway use. 
    Substantial damage. A building is considered substantially damaged when it sustains damage from 
any cause (fire, flood, earthquake, etc.,) whereby the cost of fully restoring the structure would equal or 
exceed 50 percent of the pre-damage market value of the structure, regardless of the actual repair work 
performed. 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1) ?Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the 
cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either: 
a. ?Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
b. ?If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
(2) ?For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the 
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, 
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
(3) ?The term does not, however, include either: 
a. ?Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, 
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living 
conditions; or 
b. ?Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the 
structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Transition section means reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a narrow cross 
section or vice versa. 
    Wet bottom stormwater storage area means a stormwater storage area that is designed and 
maintained to contain a certain volume of water temporarily when excess stormwater runoff occurs, and

Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2. 


Sec. 34-33. - Responsibility for administration and enforcement. 
(a) ?There is hereby created the office of public works director, an administrative office of the village. 
The office shall be filled by appointment of a person educated, trained, or experienced in 
construction practices. The appointment shall be made by the village manager, subject to the 
approval of the village board. 
(b) ?The public works director shall be responsible for the general administration and enforcement of this 
article, as well as portions of the soil erosion and sedimentation and land development ordinances, 
including but not limited to the following duties: 
(1) ?Review, issue permits for, and inspect all development projects to ensure they comply with the 
provisions of this article. 
(2) ?Ensure that new development and major improvements to existing facilities or buildings will not 
change the flow of surface water runoff so that properties become more susceptible to damage. 
(Ord. No. 97-55, § 1, 7-7-1997; Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007) 


Sec. 34-34. - Surface water runoff control. 
(a) ?Whenever land is developed such that increased runoff would result from such development, 
surface water runoff shall be limited by stormwater detention, retention, or equivalent upon the tract 
being developed. Runoff of surface water from the tract under development shall be limited to a 
maximum of one-tenth inch per hour of runoff per acre of land, unless a lower rate has been 
established as a result of a drainage study that has been accepted by the village board. 
(b) ?Development detention shall be the aggregate of the detention volume required because of the 
change in permeability of the land due to its development (developed storage), any storage volume 
available on the existing site due to its topography (trapped areas), and if any portion of the land 
being developed is susceptible to flooding during the base flood as described elsewhere in this 
article, compensatory storage equivalent to the storage volume provided during the base flood prior 
to the proposed development. 
(c) ?Outside of the special flood hazard area, development storage shall be determined using a method 
commonly known as the rational method, by calculating the maximum storage volume required 
during the 100-year flood based on the following criteria: 
(1) ?Rainfall intensities based on those published by the state water survey in its Bulletin 70 for the 
northeast section of the state; 
(2) ?Release rate of one-tenth inch per hour of runoff per acre being developed; 
(3) ?Impervious runoff coefficient of 0.95; and 
(4) ?Pervious runoff coefficient, considering the saturated condition of 0.50. 
(d) ?The public works director may provide standard worksheets for calculating detention volumes. In 
this case, a registered professional engineer shall indicate his calculations on these worksheets and 
submit them to the public works director for his approval. 
(e) ?In certain instances where the land to be developed is not susceptible to flooding during the base 
flood, the public works director may allow a waiver of the detention requirement. If a waiver is 
granted, then a cash contribution shall be made to the village for general flood control purposes. In 
these cases, the development shall be designed such that the runoff is directed to the public storm 
sewer and drainage system, and not onto adjacent private property. The special circumstances 
where this arrangement may be allowed is described as follows: 
(1) ?Where the developed storage is calculated to be less than five-tenths acre-feet. 
(2) ?For single-family developments, when the developed area is less than two acres. 
(3) ?For multifamily or commercial developments, when the developed area is less than 1½ acres. 
(4) ?Where an area-wide detention basin nearby is either existing, planned, under construction, or 
proposed to be built, and can adequately handle the detention required for the proposed 
development. 
(f) ?Where a contribution is allowed in lieu of detention, the amount of such contribution shall be 
approximately equal to the cost of construction of the on-site detention. The public works director 
shall publish a contribution schedule based on area of development, type of development, required 
detention volume, and/or some other criteria in order to facilitate the determination of costs for 
construction of detention basins. 
(Ord. No. 97-55, § 1, 7-7-1997; Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007) 


Sec. 34-35. - Excavation, filling and grading. 
(a) ?Permit required; application. The excavation of land, placement of any fill material, and/or grading of 
same shall require a permit from the public works director. Minor landscaping improvements are not 
intended to be included under this section. The following information may be required by the public 
works director to be submitted with the application for permit: 
(1) ?Topographic survey, showing existing and proposed elevations above mean sea level both on 
the site and within 50 feet of the site; 
(2) ?Erosion control plan, showing proposed temporary erosion control measures in order to avoid 
sedimentation on adjacent properties or in public storm sewers; and 
(3) ?Landscaping plan, showing proposed final landscaping and permanent erosion control. 
(b) ?Permit fees. The fees pertaining to this section are as shown in section 34-111. 
(c) ?Bond. When done as a separate project, the public works director may require a cash bond be 
posted to ensure final grading and permanent erosion control in accordance with the approved plan.

FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
(2) ?Compensatory storage. 
a. ?Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will 
be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency 
flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent 
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood 
elevation. 
b. ?The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due 
to the fill or structure. 
c. ?In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or 
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. 
d. ?All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced 
below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 
ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation.

(1) ?List of appropriate uses. The only development in a floodway which will be allowed is 
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not 
create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to 
public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of 
the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. 
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this 
article. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Illinois Administrative Code part 708 will be 
allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
a. ?Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements 
relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and 
wildlife. 
b. ?Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, 
such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to 
recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water-dependent uses. 
c. ?Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls. 
d. ?Underground and overhead utilities. 
e. ?Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing 
(at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction 
of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four-stall maximum) that 
will [not] block flood flows or reduce floodway storage. 
f. ?Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures that will not 
block flood flows or reduce floodway storage. 
g. ?Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any 
modification thereto. 
h. ?Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either: 
1. ?The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot; or 
2. ?The applicant of a shortterm recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to 
restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage 
caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
i. ?Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive non-erosive slope toward a 
watercourse. 
j. ?Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures, including the 
construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls 
around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of 
the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing 
structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
k. ?The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside 
dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50 percent or more of 
the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding 
to the flood protection elevation. 
l. ?Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the 
building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows, 
including but not limited to fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story 
additions. If the building [is] improved to 50 percent or more of the market value before the 
modification occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection 
elevation. 
(2) ?Non-appropriate uses. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any 
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications 
done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including 
landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as 
specifically defined above as an appropriate use. 
(3) ?Construction in floodway. Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps 
designated by IDNR/OWR, the construction of an appropriate use will be considered 
permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation 
criteria and this is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a 
registered professional engineer, and provided that any structure meets the protection 
requirements of section 34-42: 
a. ?Preservation of flood conveyance so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For 
appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all 
effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all 
flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective 
designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
1. ?Designated floodway conveyance, "K," equals (1.486/n)(AR 2/3 ), where "n" is 
Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross section, and "R" 
is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven 
Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.) 
2. ?The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions 
unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of 
government can ensure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover 
is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
3. ?Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated 
floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used 
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering 
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same 
efficiency: 
i. ?When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should 
be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every 
four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
ii. ?When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should 
be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every 
one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
iii. ?When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one 
foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
iv. ?Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid 
expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway 
delineation on adjacent properties. 
v. ?All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood 
flows. 
b. ?Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. 
1. ?Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due 
to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any 
related flood control projects. 
2. ?Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the 
volume of floodplain storage lost. 
3. ?Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall 
not be required to be replaced. 
4. ?The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the 
proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All 
designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be 
replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway 
storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the 
proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain 
freely and openly to the watercourse. 
5. ?If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed 
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a 
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory 
storage is hydraulically equivalent. 
6. ?There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway 
modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at the existing 
structure. 
c. ?Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream erosion or flood heights. 
1. ?For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the 
proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated 
floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year 
frequency event. 
2. ?In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of 
backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be 
increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by 
the use of riprap or other design measures. 
d. ?Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. 
1. ?The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages 
greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up 
to and including the 100-year frequency event, or the upstream flood stage increases 
will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the 
channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or 
floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. 
2. ?If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot, 
the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver. 
i. ?The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the 
flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for 
the flood study specified in section 34-38. Culverts must be analyzed using the 
U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of 
Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal 
Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation procedures. 
ii. ?Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per section 34-40(c)(3)b. 
iii. ?Velocity increases must be mitigated per section 34-40(c)(3)c.

commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received. 
v. ?The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the 
existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to 
IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a conditional letter of map revision is not 
required by section 34-40(c). 
vi. ?All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per section 
34-40(c)(3)h. 
e. ?Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and approach roads. 
1. ?The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be 
constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the existing flood 
profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing 
structure is not a source of flood damage. 
2. ?If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to 
buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall 
evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, 
taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream 
properties. 
3. ?The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood 
damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 92 Illinois 
Administrative Code part 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and 
submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
f. ?On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. 
1. ?Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the 
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency 
event, shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical 
extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of 
existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. 
2. ?A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR 
for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal 
or flood flow. 
3. ?All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 34-32 shall meet the 
permitting requirements of 92 Illinois Administrative Code part 702 (Construction and 
Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel 
or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
i. ?The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood 
control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
ii. ?The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species which 
require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
iii. ?The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or 
habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, 
appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
iv. ?A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the upstream 
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input 
of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than 
one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the 
impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to 
ensure comprehensive watershed control; and 
v. ?The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 34-40. 
g. ?Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. 
1. ?If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the 
outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten 
feet from the outside of the building. 
2. ?Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing 
activities. 
h. ?Excavation in floodway. 
1. ?When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including 
the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to 
compensate for lost conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be 
provided for the excavation. 
2. ?The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's 
engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests 
that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
i. ?When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should 
be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every 
four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
ii. ?When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should 
be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every 
one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
iii. ?When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one 
foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
iv. ?Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of 
the transition sections. 
i. ?If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
1. ?There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its 
purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. 
Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing 
structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow 
channel, or the establishment of a stream-side buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel 
modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve 
water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. 
2. ?Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by 
the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are 
offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values. 
3. ?The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which 
will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water 
affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
i. ?The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as 
possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and 
sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of 
more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel 
modification design, where practical. 
ii. ?Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and 
downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
iii. ?One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of 
stream-side (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, 
where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the 
vegetation. 
iv. ?Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for 
construction of the channel. 
v. ?Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 
horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side 
slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or 
sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil 
bioengineering techniques, natural rock or riprap are preferred approaches. 
Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be 
avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
vi. ?All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise 
stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blankets 
or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks 
prior to establishment of vegetative cover. 
vii. ?If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep 
pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the 
new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible 
with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
viii. ?A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to 
reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
ix. ?New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of 
construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of 
water into the new channel. 
x. ?There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves 
the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood 
control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat 
improvement or erosion control project. 
xi. ?Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no 
reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of 
the modification. 
4. ?The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 34-40. 
j. ?Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and 
stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
k. ?Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including 
grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil 
erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the 
following criteria: 
1. ?The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation 
possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and 
unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, 
or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
2. ?Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as 
soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days 
after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded 
areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 
days. 
3. ?Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or 
filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off-site or 
into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale 
fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
4. ?A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or 
reestablished, where possible, along existing channels (section 34-40(c)(3)p). 
Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings 
shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction 
in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
5. ?Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented 
consistent with Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation 
Control in Illinois (1988), also known as the "Green Book," and the Illinois Urban 
Manual (NRCS, 1995). 
l. ?Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of 
this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through 
hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or 
cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements 
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
m. ?General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
1. ?The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, 
referenced in section 34-38, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the 
study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be 
contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to 
use. 
2. ?If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction 
is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage 
area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet: 
i. ?The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the 
designated floodway conditions; and 
ii. ?Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
3. ?If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a 
downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, or 
modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, 
constructed or modified, within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be 
analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing 
conditions and the expected flood profile conditions with the bridge, culvert for flood 
control project is built. 
n. ?Conditional letter of map revision. 
1. ?If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or 
the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and 
FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a 
conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a 
conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. 
2. ?The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or 
record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities are 
submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
3. ?In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the 
county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated 
floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. 
4. ?No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval 
is issued. 
5. ?After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a 
final letter of map revision is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. 
o. ?Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or 
under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
p. ?Construction near channel. For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 
feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
1. ?A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the 
ordinary high-water mark of the channel. 
2. ?Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an 
appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of 
construction. 
q. ?Revision of floodway map. After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway 
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as 
necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures 
or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the 
designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The 
designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR 
and FEMA of the as-built plans. 
(4) ?Other permits. 
a. ?In addition to the other requirements of this article, a development permit for a site located 
in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written 
documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 
5/5 et seq. 
b. ?No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated this 
responsibility to the village.

permission of the bridge owner). No supporting towers shall be placed in the 
watercourse and towers shall be designed so as to not catch debris: 
5. ?Disturbance of stream-side vegetation shall be kept to a minimum during construction 
to prevent erosion and sedimentation. All disturbed floodway areas, including the 
stream banks, shall be restored to their original contours and seeded or otherwise 
stabilized upon completion of construction; 
6. ?A utility crossing carrying material which may cause water pollution as defined by the

State Law reference Similar provisions, 720 ILCS 5/11-9.  
Sec. 58-11. - Obscenity. 
(a)  Elements of the offense. A person commits obscenity, which is prohibited, when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he: 
(1)  Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment of the obscene; 
(2)  Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; 
(3)  Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene; 
(4)  Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his body for gain; 
(5)  Creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene matter or material with intent to disseminate it in violation of this section, or of the penal laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or 
(6)  Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene. 
(b)  Obscene defined. Any material or performance is obscene if: 
(1)  The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and 
(2)  The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and 
(3)  Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. 
(c)  Interpretation of evidence. 
(1)  Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience. 
(2)  Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. 
(3)  In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be admissible to show: 
a.  The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed; 
b.  What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effects, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people; 
c.  The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or absence thereof; 
d.  The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state; 
e.  Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material; 
f.  Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator. 
(d)  Forfeiture of property. 
(1)  Obscenity is a far-reaching and extremely profitable crime, which persists despite the threat of prosecution and successful prosecution because existing sanctions do not effectively reach the money and other assets generated by it. The state has, therefore, determined it to be necessary to supplement existing sanctions by mandating forfeiture of money and other assets generated by such crime, to diminish the financial incentives which encourage and sustain obscenity and secure for the state, local government and prosecutors a resource for prosecuting obscenity crimes. 
(2)  The village shall assist the county state's attorney and the attorney general of the state in investigating and prosecuting crimes of obscenity and in obtaining forfeiture of property pursuant to state law, and specifically pursuant to the procedures set forth in 720 ILCS 5/11-20. 
(e)  Prima facie evidence of intent to disseminate. The creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of obscene material, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to disseminate. 
(f)  Affirmative defense. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination: 
(1)  Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under 18 years of age; or 
(2)  Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.

The village shall only be required to notify a lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee's name by an affidavit and a copy of the lease within 60 days of the notice's issuance. If the driver information is not provided within 60 days, the leasing company/lessor may be found liable. If any notice to an address is returned as undeliverable, a second notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database of the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first class mail postage prepaid. 
A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the traffic compliance administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 14.261, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in section 58-262 is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. The traffic compliance administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle.

ARTICLE II. - PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
 
Sec. 62-31. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this policy manual shall be to outline rules and regulations and to define the respective rights, duties and obligations concerning wages, hours, benefits, work rules and other conditions of employment for the village and its employees. In the formulation of this policy, the village board of trustees recognizes that the village is a creature of the State of Illinois (the "state") and that employee rules and regulations must conform to the statutes of the state and to the ordinances of the village. Within this framework, the village board of trustees must be in final control. Subject to these conditions, the board of trustees can establish governing principles upon which a progressive program of employee relationships may be based. To achieve these ends, this policy manual sets forth regulations and standards to: 
(1)  Establish a system of personnel administration based upon merit and equitable administration. 
(2)  Establish and maintain a uniform and equitable plan of position classification and compensation based on duties and responsibilities of positions in the village service. 
(3)  Develop a personnel program that will make a career in municipal government attractive to persons who possess the ability, integrity and dedication to public service. 
(4)  Provide a plan for continuing growth and education of the municipal employee that will provide the competence and initiative required for effective performance, equitable compensation and public respect. 
(5)  Outline rules of conduct and procedure to be followed by employees that will result in effective performance and morale. 
(6)  Authorize the village manager or designee to develop interpretative rules, regulations and manuals based upon the policy manual. Such rules, regulations and manuals shall be developed for the sole purpose of providing more detailed and clearer guidance and explanation of the policies set forth in this chapter. If the village manager shall determine that the interpretative rules, regulations and manuals cannot reasonably be developed to explain village policies, the village manager shall recommend to the village board an amendment to this chapter. All interpretative rules, regulations and manuals developed by the village manager or his designee shall be approved by the village board.

The expense for these examinations, if required by the village or otherwise mandated, shall be paid for by the village. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-65. - Promotion policies. 
All vacancies occurring in the village service shall, whenever possible, be filled by promotion of a qualified employee within the village service. However, the village manager may authorize recruitment of applicants from outside the village service whenever he has reason to believe that better qualified applicants are available outside of the village. Promotion within the village shall be based on the qualifications of the person being appointed. Usually, the first consideration in the filling of vacancies will be given to the most qualified applicant in the department in which the vacancy exists. Next, consideration will be given to the most qualified applicant from outside the department. The criteria used in the selection of the most qualified applicant shall be based upon experience, performance, evaluation and, where feasible, examination. 
If no acceptable applicant is found among the village employees, the vacancy will be filled from outside the village service. Transfer between departments within the same position classification will be considered when a vacancy occurs, but first preference will be given to promotion within the department. 
Police department supervisory promotions are administered by the fire and police commission.

Sec. 62-66. - Outside employment. 
No employee shall accept outside employment, whether full-time, part-time, temporary or permanent, without prior written approval from the village manager. Each employee who wishes to engage in outside employment shall notify the village manager in writing through his or her department head. Such notification shall carry the following information: 
(1)  The name of the employee; 
(2)  The name of the prospective employer; 
(3)  The nature of the outside work; and 
(4)  The schedule of the outside work. 
Each and every change in outside employment shall require separate approval. Approval shall not be granted when such outside employment conflicts or interferes, or is likely to conflict or interfere, with the employee's position within the village. No employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render any service for private interest when such employment or service is incompatible or creates a conflict of interest with his or her official duties within the village. Employees of the village may not engage in outside business activities while on normal duty, nor on village property at any time whatsoever. 
In a situation where the village manager has approved outside employment, the village manager may thereafter prohibit the outside employment at any time if, in his judgment, such employment might or has become detrimental to the best interests of the village. In such cases, the employee will be given an appropriate notice and then must decide if he wants to continue his service with the village, or with the outside employer. 
Upon review and approval of the village manager individual departments may impose more restrictive guidelines for outside employment as deemed appropriate and necessary. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-67. - Employment of relatives. 
It shall be the policy of the village not to employ immediate family members of any person on the village board or any village board appointed boards and commissions, in any full-time position. With respect to other village employees, no such immediate family member shall be employed by the village in any capacity unless such person is otherwise qualified and meets all requirements for such employment. It shall also be the policy of the village to not allow two or more relatives to work in the same department/division in circumstances where one relative occupies a position that supervises the other relative or has influence involving the relative's employment, promotion, supervision, salary advancement, or other personnel decisions; the only exception being temporary seasonal employment. The same prohibitions apply to employees who marry, cohabitate, or become related by marriage. If immediate family members of such village employees are employed as permitted by this section, they shall, in all cases, be treated the same as any other employee in a comparable position for purposes of wages, benefits paid, and work evaluations. 
The provisions of this section shall not be retroactive, and no action is to be taken concerning those members of the same family employed at the time of adoption of this section. This section shall not be construed nor applied to discriminate on the basis of marital status.

Sec. 62-68. - Political activity. 
Employees shall not be appointed or retained within the village on the basis of their political activity. Employees shall not be coerced to take part in political campaigns, to solicit votes, to levy, contribute or solicit funds or support for the purpose of supporting or opposing the appointment or election of candidates for any municipal office. Employees are encouraged to exercise their individual right to vote. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-69. - Seeking public office. 
No village employee shall seek election to public office of the village without first having obtained an unpaid leave of absence from his position in the village service. Such leave of absence shall continue until after the election takes place. Upon taking the oath of village office, the leave shall automatically cease and the employee shall be deemed to have forfeited his or her position as a village employee. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-70. - Solicitation and distribution.

(4)  Employees and non-employees are prohibited from posting non-work related materials or literature on village property, including but not limited to bulletin boards. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-71. - Standards of dress-groom-personal hygiene. 
(a)  Introduction. Each employee's dress, grooming, and personal hygiene shall be appropriate to the work situation. Employees are expected at all times to present a professional, businesslike appearance to customers and the public. A professional image means wearing clothing that is clean, neat and with no holes or fraying. Without compromising the professional image the village seeks to portray, the village also wishes to allow employees to dress comfortably. Employees are expected to be well groomed and dressed as described below. Standards of dress may be adopted on a departmental basis. 
(b)  Appearance standards. 
(1)  Uniformed employees. Employees required to wear a standardized uniform shall follow the particular standards established in their respective departments related to acceptable and required uniform attire including any required safety related equipment and clothing. When permitted by department policy, if a typically uniformed employee is allowed to wear non-uniform attire when performing job tasks, the employee shall follow the standards established for non-uniformed employees. 
(2)  Non-uniformed employees. Employees not required to wear a uniform are required to follow a business or business casual standard (except on Casual Friday). The village defines business casual as the following: 
Slacks (dress, khakis, corduroy); skirts, dresses, skorts, shirts (collared, turtlenecks, polo), blouses, sweaters, blazers, sport coats; shoes (loafers, leather boat/deck shoes, dress shoes, dress boots, dress sandals, and open toed shoes). 
(3)  Unacceptable clothing/accessories. The following is a list of clothing/accessory items that are not allowed and shall not be worn. While this list provides a broad range, it is not all inclusive, and, at any time, a department head may deem attire unacceptable that is not listed below: 
a.  Sweat suits, sweat pants, sweat shirts, wind suits (except as provided by the village); 
b.  Leggings, jumpsuits or form-fitting stretch pants; 
c.  Shorts or short skirts (more than three inches above knees); 
d.  Tank tops, t-shirts, halter tops, spaghetti straps, low cut tops or tops with a low neckline; 
e.  Any type of shirt with an objectionable logo or slogan; 
f.  Beachwear or bib overalls; 
g.  Athletic shoes, flip flops, hiking sandals; 
h.  Torn or frayed clothing; 
i.  Visible undergarments; 
j.  Jeans of any color (except on designated casual days)**; 
k.  Men's work boots or shoes with lugged soles**; 
l.  Objectionable tattoos; 
m.  Body piercing (except limited ear piercing); 
n.  Hats (except as provided by the village or approved by department head). 
** Exceptions: It is understandable that employees doing field, maintenance, or custodial work may be wearing jeans/work pants and work boots through the week. 
The village permits employees to wear jewelry, display tattoos, or limited ear piercing at the workplace within the following guidelines. Factors that management will consider in determining whether jewelry, tattoos, or ear piercing may pose a conflict with the employee's job or work environment include: 
1.  Personal safety of self or others, or damage to village property. 
2.  Productivity or performance expectations. 
3.  Offensiveness to co-workers, customers, vendors, or others in the workplace based on racial, sexual, religious, ethnic, or other characteristics or attributes of a sensitive or legally protected nature. 
4.  Corporate or societal norms. 
5.  Customer complaints. 
If management determines an employee's jewelry, tattoos, or ear piercings may present such a conflict, the employee will be encouraged to identify appropriate options, such as removal of excess or offensive jewelry or piercings, covering of tattoos, or other reasonable means to resolve the conflict. 
(c)  Casual dress day. Casual dress day will be on Fridays. Although the dress code is relaxed, clothing will not detract from the professional image of the department. Jeans, if worn, will be clean and of good quality and repair (no holes or fraying). Apparel such as sweat/wind suits, t-shirts, shorts, exercise pants and jogging suits are not allowed for casual days. 
(d)  Enforcement. Department heads are responsible for monitoring the appearance of their respective employees. The determination as to what is acceptable appearance shall be made by the department head. If a department head determines that an employee is not in compliance with the village's standards for appropriate workplace appearance, the employee may be sent home (without pay unless an employee is permitted to use accrued benefit time) to charge. Progressive disciplinary action may be taken for repeated violations of this policy. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 10-86, § 1, 5-17-2010; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 10-86, § 1, adopted May 17, 2010, amended § 62-71 title to read as herein set out. Former § 62-71 title pertained to standards of dress.  
Sec. 62-72. - Equal opportunity in employment. 
The village is firmly committed to equality of opportunity in employment. It is the responsibility of the village to ensure that employment, training, compensation, promotion and other conditions of employment are provided without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, genetic information, marital or parental status, military status, unfavorable discharge from military service, (except dishonorable discharge), and mental or physical disability unrelated to the employee's ability to perform the job, except where it is determined to be a bona fide occupational qualification in accordance with federal, state, and local laws. It is also the responsibility of the village to ensure that it does not deny equality of opportunity to any qualified individual who is able, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the employment position which he or she holds or for which he or she applies. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-73. - Sexual harassment. 
The village shall provide employees an employment environment free of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communications constituting sexual harassment, as defined and otherwise prohibited by state and federal law. The village will not tolerate sexual harassment of any of its employees and will take immediate steps to investigate and stop it when it occurs. The village has created a policy entitled "sexual harassment" ("sexual harassment policy") which explains the rules and procedures pertaining to sexual harassment in the workplace. All village employees and elected officials are required to read, abide by, and acknowledge receipt of the sexual harassment policy upon employment and as may be required thereafter. 
Additionally, all village employees must attend an annual training session on this sexual harassment policy, as provided or approved by the village. 
(1)  Definition of sexual harassment. Village employees shall not make sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, written, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 
a.  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of the individual's employment; 
b.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for an employment decision affecting that individual (tangible employment action); or 
c.  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. 
d.  For purposes of this definition, the phrase "working environment" is not limited to a physical location an employee is assigned to perform his or her duties and does not require an employment relationship. 
The terms intimidating, hostile or offensive include, but are not limited to, conduct which has the effect of humiliation, embarrassment or discomfort. Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to: 
a.  Physical assaults of a sexual nature, including but not limited to rape, sexual battery, molestation, intentional physical conduct which is sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, etc.; 
b.  Unwanted sexual advances, propositions, or other sexual comments including, but not limited to sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, jokes or comments or verbal abuse of a sexual nature. Also included are preferential treatment and promises of a preferential treatment to an employee for submitting to sexual conduct; 
c.  Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in village workplace by village employees including, but not limited to, pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, reading materials, or other materials that are sexually suggestive, demeaning or pornographic. 
Sexual harassment may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Sexual harassment often is associated with those situations in which a power differential exists between the persons involved, but it also can occur between individuals of the same employment status. Sexual harassment includes conduct based on gender regardless of whether the offensive conduct is sexual in nature. 
d.  Electronic harassment such as sexting, the use of sexually explicit language, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication, i.e. e-mail, text, picture, video messages, intranet, online postings, blogs, instant messages, and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter. 
(2)  Reporting of sexual harassment. Employees are encouraged to report any incidents of sexual harassment to their immediate supervisor and to the human resources director. Employees may also choose to report incidents of sexual harassment to any number of persons who will be designated annually on a list distributed annually and posted by the village manager's office. 
In addition, employees may file a report of harassment in accordance with the standard grievance procedure as specified in this policy manual. Personnel subject to the jurisdiction of the fire and police commission may file complaints of harassment in accordance with the board's established rules and regulations. 
Anyone receiving a report of harassment must promptly notify the human resources director, unless it would be inappropriate to do so, given the fact that the human resources director or someone closely connected to the human resources director is involved in the alleged harassment. 
(3)  Employee responsibility. All persons at the village can help assure that our workplace is free from prohibited sexual harassment. Every employee is expected to avoid any behavior or conduct that could reasonably be interpreted as sexual harassment. No employees, not even the highest-ranking village employees, are exempt from the requirements of the sexual harassment policy. 
(4)  Investigation and corrective action. If you believe you have been subjected to sexual harassment, you have the right to file a complaint. Once notified of a complaint, the human resources director (or someone else, where appropriate) will investigate the report promptly, thoroughly, and, to the extent possible, confidentially. The fact that the complainant may not wish to cooperate does not relieve the village of the responsibility to investigate harassment reports. If investigation confirms that a violation of the sexual harassment policy has occurred, the village will take corrective action, including discipline, up to and including termination of employment, as is appropriate. procedures and rights under the established rules and regulations of the board of police and fire commissioners will be followed during any investigation or disciplinary action where applicable. All other applicable rights guaranteed by law will be followed during any investigation or disciplinary action. The village may discipline an employee for any inappropriate conduct discovered in investigating reports made under the sexual harassment policy, regardless of whether the conduct amounts to a violation of law or even a violation of policy. 
a.  Any person who violates section 5-65 of Public Act 100-0554 is subject to a fine of up to $5,000.00 per offense, and is subject of discipline or discharge by the appropriate ultimate jurisdictional authority (as described above). Each violation of section 5-65 is a separate offense. Any penalty imposed by an ethics commission of the state shall be separate and distinct from any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or state or federal agency. 
(5)  False complaints. Employees who in bad-faith make a false complaint of harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of Public Act 100-0554 to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a state's attorney, the attorney general, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. 
An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000.00 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. 
(6)  Confidentiality. Complaints of harassment, investigation of complaints of harassment, and any corrective actions taken in response to harassment will be kept confidential to the extent possible. 
(7)  No retaliation. The village prohibits reprisal or retaliation against an employee for filing a good-faith complaint of harassment or for supporting or assisting in good-faith another employee in pursuing a complaint. For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means a reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment taken in retaliation for an employee's involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy. Employees are afforded protections pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)-(b)) and the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101). Employees must report incidents of retaliation on the same basis as they are to report incidents of harassment. 
(8)  State and federal remedies. The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough, and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the village. Consistent with the sexual harassment policy, the village maintains posters on bulletin boards that refer to legal definitions of harassment. These posters identify governmental agencies to contact on how and when to file administrative claims. In addition to using the village complaint process an employee has the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. The time period for an EEOC filing is 300 days from the harassment.

Sec. 62-74. - Discrimination and harassment. 
(a)  Definition. The village shall provide employees an employment environment free from unlawful discrimination and/or harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or physical or mental disability. The village will not tolerate discrimination and/or harassment of any kind by any of its employees. The village will implement steps to stop the discrimination when it occurs. 
Village employees shall not engage in any conduct constituting discrimination and/or harassment of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, or physical or mental disability. Discrimination is any hostile or offensive act or expression against a person on the grounds of his or her race, color, religion, national origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status or disability. Harassment is conduct, verbal or physical, towards another person or identifiable groups of persons that has the purpose or effect of: 
(1)  Creating an intimidating or hostile work environment; 
(2)  Unreasonably interfering with a person's work environment; 
(3)  Unreasonably affecting a person's work opportunities; or 
(4)  Causing an individual to feel intimidated, demeaned or abused. 
Harassment can take many forms. It may include display or circulation of written materials degrading to a person's gender, race, ethnicity or religion. It may include verbal abuse or insults directed at or made in the presence of members of a racial, ethnic, religious or minority group. 
(b)  Violation of policy. A violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment with the village. 
(c)  False complaints. Any person making a knowingly false accusation regarding discrimination and/or harassment pursuant to this section will likewise be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment with the village. 
(d)  Reporting of discrimination/harassment. Employees are encouraged to report any incidents of discrimination and/or harassment to their immediate supervisor and to the human resources director. Employees may also choose to report incidents of discrimination and/or harassment to any number of persons who will be designated annually on a list distributed annually and posted by the village manager's office. 
In addition, employees may file a report of discrimination and/or harassment in accordance with the standard grievance procedure as specified in this policy manual. Personnel subject to the jurisdiction of the fire and police commission may file complaints of discrimination and/or harassment in accordance with the board's established rules and regulations. 
Anyone receiving a report of discrimination and/or harassment must promptly notify the human resources director, unless it would be inappropriate to do so, given the fact that the human resources director or someone closely connected to the human resources director is involved in the alleged discrimination and/or harassment. 
(e)  Investigation and corrective action. Once notified of a report of harassment, the human resources director (or someone else, where appropriate) will investigate the report promptly, thoroughly, and, to the extent possible, confidentially. The fact that the complainant may not wish to cooperate does not relieve the village of the responsibility to investigate the reports. If investigation confirms that a violation of this policy has occurred, the village will take corrective action, including discipline, up to and including termination of employment, as is appropriate. Procedures and rights under the established rules and regulations of the board of police and fire commissioners will be followed during any investigation or disciplinary action where applicable. All other applicable rights guaranteed by law will be followed during any investigation or disciplinary action.

Sec. 62-75. - Drug-free workplace. 
The Village of Westmont is committed to maintaining a drug-free workplace in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In order to protect the public, ensure a safe work environment and provide a healthy, productive workforce, the village requires compliance with the following procedures and guidelines: 
(1)  The village prohibits the unlawful use, consumption, manufacturing, dispensing, distribution, or possession of a controlled substance or alcohol while on village premises, in village vehicles, or while performing work for the village. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, a controlled substance includes: 
Cannabis; 
a.  Any substance that is not legally obtainable; 
b.  Any substance that is being used in a manner different than prescribed; 
c.  Any substance that is legally obtainable, but has not been legally obtained; 
d.  Any substance that is defined as such by any state or federal law, rule or regulation. 
(3)  Any employee found using, possessing, manufacturing, distributing or dispensing a controlled substance or alcoholic beverage on village premises or in village vehicles, while performing work for the village, or being under the influence of a controlled substance or alcoholic beverage while performing work for the village, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment. Such disciplinary action may include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program as a condition of reinstatement or continued employment with the village. 
(4)  The village may require employees to submit to appropriate alcohol and/or drug testing, including but not limited to urinalysis and/or blood testing, prior to hiring, promotion, or subsequent to any on-the-job injury or accident. The village may also require testing whenever there is reasonable suspicion of controlled substance or alcohol abuse by an employee. The results of any drug and/or alcohol testing shall be sent to the human resources director, but shall remain confidential to the extent required by law. Refusal to submit to such testing or failure to pass such testing shall be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
(5)  Any employee who is involved in an accident while operating a village owned or leased vehicle, will be subject to post-accident testing. Testing will take place immediately following the incident, when practical. If not completed immediately, the test must be taken within 24 hours following such incident. The employee shall consume no alcohol or controlled substances subsequent to the accident and prior to the post-accident test. Failure to complete a test within the allotted times will be considered by the village as the employee having refused to submit to testing. 
Post-accident testing will take place when one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  The employee has been issued a citation. 
b.  The accident results in a fatality, or the transport of one or more patients to a medical facility or if a person is injured, is treated but signs a refusal. 
c.  The accident results in one or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage, requiring the vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle. 
d.  Immediately following an accident, the police officer, or a department supervisor notices that the employee involved in the accident demonstrates impaired movements or speech, or they have any reasonable suspicion of improper controlled substance or alcohol use. When an employee is requested to immediately go for an alcohol and/or drug test following an incident, he or she shall be accompanied by a supervisor. 
(6)  When the lab finds an employee's results to be negative, no other action is taken and the results are recorded as negative. All negative results will be reported back to the human resource director within three calendar days of such test. 
(7)  If the results of an employee's alcohol and/or drug test are positive, no immediate results or notifications are made until the medical review physician from Midwest Orthopaedics reviews those results. Contact will be made with the employee in order to make a judgment of why these results were positive. If they are prescribed drugs, contact will be made with the employee's physician to insure that these were prescribed drugs. In some cases retesting may be necessary but only with direction from the medical review physician. This person will determine the time frame when another test is appropriate. 
a.  Results shall be transmitted to the human resource director for the village, or designee, in a confidential manner, and in writing. 
b.  When results are forwarded to the village, only a report of a positive or negative result will be sent. No reports with actual readings will be sent. This clearance will become part of the employee's medical record. In the case of a positive alcohol result, the result may be revealed. No employee will be allowed to report for duty with a positive alcohol reading. A violation of this policy will be considered to have occurred if the alcohol level is greater than .04 as determined by whichever testing method was used. Please note: An individual department's lower alcohol level supersedes the level in this policy. 
c.  Any employee found to test positive with an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater, but less than .04, will be sent home without pay, until the start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than twenty-four hours following administration of the test. 
(8)  Any employee convicted of a criminal controlled substance or alcohol- related offense involving the workplace shall notify his or her supervisor in the village within five calendar days of the conviction. The village will notify any applicable contracting agency within ten calendar days of receiving such notice from the employee or other actual notice of the conviction. 
(9)  The village utilizes an ongoing drug education program which cautions employees about the dangers of controlled substance and alcohol abuse generally and in the workplace. The village will assist an employee in utilizing the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP personnel are qualified professionals who will make confidential assessment and referral for services and treatment for controlled substance and alcohol abuse, as well as other personal problems. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 16-031, § 2, 2-18-2016)  
Sec. 62-76. - Workplace violence. 
The village is committed to providing, as much as reasonably possible, a safe environment for working and conducting business. The village will not tolerate acts of violence committed by or against village employees, or members of the public, while on village property or while performing village business at other locations. 
Acts of violence include, but are not limited to, acts or behaviors that: 
 Are physically assaultive; 
 A reasonable person would perceive as obsessively directed, e.g. intensely focused on a grudge, grievance, or romantic interest in another person, and reasonably likely to result in harm or threats of harm to persons or property; 
 Consists of a communicated or reasonably perceived threat to harm another individual or in any way endanger the safety of an individual; 
 Would be interpreted by a reasonable person as carrying potential for physical harm to the individual; 
 Is a behavior, or action, that a reasonable person would perceive as menacing; 
 Involves carrying or displaying weapons, destroying property, or throwing objects in a manner reasonably perceived to be threatening; or 
 Consists of a communicated or reasonably perceived threat to destroy property. 
The village has created a workplace violence policy which describes in detail the policy's goals and objectives, the prohibitions on dangerous weapons by employees, employee responsibilities, procedures for dealing with acts of violence in the workplace, and procedures for investigations and reporting of incidents. Village employees are required to read, comply with, and acknowledge receipt of the workplace violence policy, which is provided at the commencement of employment and also available through human resources. Discipline for violation of the workplace violence policy may include disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
In order to prevent workplace violence, the village adopted a "no weapons policy" which specifically prohibits the possession of firearms by any employee while upon or inside [any] village building or vehicle. This ban specifically excludes sworn village police officers and arson investigators. No village employee shall carry, store, possess or bring any concealed weapon into any village building or vehicle. Any village employee who violates this prohibition is subject to discipline, up to and including termination. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 14-44, § 1, 3-6-2014)  
Sec. 62-77. - Information technology. 
Recent advances in electronic communications and information technologies present valuable opportunities for the village. These technologies, when properly used, support our business activities and enable us to better serve our customers and residents through closer and timelier communications and nearly instantaneous access to vast stores of information. In recognition of these benefits, the village has made a substantial investment in upgrading and maintaining its electronic communications and information systems. While the village encourages the use of its systems, such use carries with it important responsibilities. The careless or inappropriate use of these systems can have dramatic consequences, including harm to the village, our customers, our residents and the individual users of village systems. 
The village has created a computer use policy and an e-mail and electronic communication policy which govern the use of technology by village employees. Employees are required to read, comply with, and acknowledge receipt of these policies, which are available at the commencement of employment and at any time thereafter through human resources. 
The computer use policy and the e-mail and electronic communication policy are intended to minimize the likelihood of harm caused by electronic communications by educating users as to proper and improper usage of information technology, and by setting forth the conditions that apply whenever the village's electronic communications tools are being used. Usage guidelines for communications tools include those pertaining to conditions of access, acceptable use, unacceptable content, transmitting confidential information, etiquette and employer representation, limits of privacy and viruses. Discipline for misuse of any village communications tools or other violations of village policies may include disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
Many employees work in positions where innovations, improvements, inventions, discoveries, copyrightable work, or new ideas may be developed or conceived in the course of their employment. If these creative works are developed on village time or created through the use of village equipment and facilities, the employee is obligated to disclose these works and agree to assign all rights, title, and interest to the village, provided that they: 
 Relate directly to the business of the village. 
 Result from the employee's work with the village; or 
 Involve the use of village equipment, supplies, facilities, confidential information or time. 
The employee has no obligation to assign rights to creative works developed on their own time, without the use of village equipment, supplies, facilities, confidential information, or time.

(Ord. No. 14-44, § 2, 3-6-2014)  
Sec. 62-79. - Social media use policy. 
(a)  Policy introduction and purpose. This policy is meant to address the evolving Internet medium as an integral form of both business and social communications, by creating awareness among village employees of the related opportunities and risks associated with its use. The village recognizes that employees have the right to express themselves online, and this policy is not meant to create arbitrary rules for social media usage, or curtail constitutionally protected free speech. 
As an employer, however, it is appropriate to establish codes of conduct and reasonable expectations that should be applied to such communication activities when those expressions may have consequences to the Village of Westmont, its employees and/or the community that Village of Westmont employees represent. Positions funded by taxpayer dollars are subject to greater scrutiny, and therefore must be held to higher standards of behavior, than those in private sector organizations. The global accessibility of Internet communication makes representations related to the Village of Westmont even more important to monitor and protect. 
"Social media" (a/k/a social networking) is defined as: any website or medium (including video) that allows for interactive communication in the open with Internet users. Social media includes all types of postings on the internet, including but not limited to, social networking sites (i.e. Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, etc.), blogs and other online journals or diaries, bulletin boards and chat rooms, microblogging (i.e. Twitter, etc.,), posting on video sharing sites (i.e. YouTube, etc.,) or photo management and sharing sites (i.e. Flickr, etc.) and posting on a personal profile or website. 
(b)  Rules and guidelines . 
(1)  General rules and guidelines . The following rules and guidelines apply to the use of social media, whether such use is for the Village of Westmont on Village time, for personal use during non-work time, outside the workplace or during working time while using village-owned equipment. (Using the Village of Westmont's equipment to access social media sites for personal use is also governed by the Electronic Communications and Record Retention Policy. Employees should also refer to this policy before accessing such sites via the village's equipment.) These rules and guidelines apply to all employees. 
a.  Employees must obtain advance permission and approval of content from the village before using social media for Village of Westmont business purposes. Employees granted permission to use social media outlets for village business purposes are responsible for complying with this policy and applicable federal, state, and county laws, regulations, and policies. This includes adherence to established laws and policies regarding copyright or plagiarism, records retention, Freedom of Information Act/FOIA, First Amendment, privacy, information security policies, and protocols established by the village. 
b.  Wherever appropriate, links to more information should direct users back to the village's official website for more information, forms, documents, or online services necessary to conduct business with the village. 
c.  Employees representing the village via social media outlets must identify themselves as village employees and conduct themselves at all times as representatives of the Village of Westmont. 
d.  Employees who fail to conduct themselves in a professional manner, and/or who are found in noncompliance with any personnel manual policies, administrative protocols, and department rules and regulations, will be subject to the corrective action procedures found in the personnel manual. 
e.  Employees are prohibited from discussing confidential, work-related matters are not limited to, security procedures, information technology systems and passwords, strategic plans, unapproved draft documents, documents and communications protected by attorney-client privilege, sensitive financial information, customer lists, and other proprietary, non-public information. Employees also have a duty to protect employees', vendors', and the public's home addresses and other personal information. 
f.  Employees cannot use social media to harass, threaten, libel or slander, malign, defame or disparage, or discriminate against co-workers, managers, customers, clients, vendors, elected officials, village administration, suppliers, any organizations associated or doing business with the Village of Westmont, or any members of the public, including web site visitors who post comments. The village's anti-harassment and EEO policies apply to use of social media in the workplace. 
g.  Employees with permission to use social media for village business purposes shall do so during their normal scheduled work week. Employees shall not use social media for village business purposes during off-duty hours without advance permission from their department supervisor. 
This protocol is not intended, nor shall it be applied, to restrict employees from discussing their wages, hours and working conditions with co-workers. 
(2)  Personal use of social media . The following rules and guidelines, in addition to the rules and guidelines set forth in section (1) above, apply to employee use of social media on the employee's personal time. 
a.  Employees should abide by the Village of Westmont's Electronic Communications and Record Retention Policy concerning personal use of the Village's computer and related equipment. 
b.  Employees who utilize social media and choose to identify themselves as employees of the Village of Westmont must make it clear that they are not speaking on behalf of the village. Employees are strongly encouraged to state explicitly, clearly, and in a prominent place on the site that their views are their own and not those of the Village of Westmont or of any person or organization affiliated or doing business with the Village of Westmont. 
c.  Employees may not use the Village of Westmont's logo, equipment or the name, or trademarks of any business partner, supplier, vendor, affiliate, or subsidiary on any personal blogs or other online sites unless their use is sponsored or otherwise sanctioned, approved, or maintained by the Village of Westmont. 
d.  Employees may not post the Village of Westmont's logo, image or confidential information or village-issued documents or equipment bearing the Village of Westmont's name or logo. 
e.  Employees may not post photographs of work-related events, accident scenes, crime scenes, other employees or village employees engaged in the Village of Westmont's business, events, or village products [e.g. clothing, hats] unless employees have received the Village of Westmont's explicit permission. Any photographs that appear on the Village of Westmont's official website, social media sites, or other official releases, may be reposted by employees without requiring advance permission. 
f.  Employees cannot advertise or sell village-owned products or services through social media unless employees have received the Village of Westmont's explicit permission. 
(3)  Employee conduct. Employees are reminded that if it comes to the village's attention that an employee's private communications on any social media site are inconsistent with this policy, other policies, rules and protocol of the village, and their employment obligations with the village, their conduct may be considered by the village in any evaluation or other employment action. Employees should have no expectation of privacy while using village equipment and facilities for any purpose, including the use of social media. The Village of Westmont reserves the right to monitor and review the use of the village's IT systems and to block content that violates this policy, and any Village of Westmont's rules and guidelines. 
All Village social media sites are subject to the Illinois Local Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and e-discovery laws and therefore, content must be able to be managed, stored and retrieved to comply with these laws. 
(4)  Protocols and procedures regarding official village use of social media . The village manager and the Westmont Public Information Officer are authorized to create a document of protocols and procedures regarding official use of social media which will supplement this policy. This policy is subject to such protocols and procedures. The protocols and procedures, which will relate to content and style of village-approved messages, must be followed by any employee authorized to post on social media as an official representative of the village. 
(5)  Violations . The village will investigate and respond to all reports of violations of this policy and other village rules and guidelines. Employees are urged to report any violations of this policy to human resources. A violation of this policy may result in discipline up to and including termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 16-032, § 2, 2-18-2016)  
Sec. 62-80. - Dual village employment policy. 
No full-time employee is eligible for hire in another full-time or part-time employment position with the village. A part-time employee is eligible for hire in another part-time employment position within the village. 
(Ord. No. 16-030, § 2, 2-18-2016)  
Sec. 62-81. - Workplace search policy. 
All offices, desks, computers, telephones, files, lockers, equipment, vehicles, etc. are the property of the village and are issued for the use of employees for business purposes only during their employment with the village. An employee has no reasonable expectation of privacy when using village-owned vehicles, property or equipment. In this connection, the Village of Westmont reserves the right to inspect or search an employee's office, desk, computer(s), emails, voicemail, files, locker, vehicle. etc. or any other area on the village premises, or property brought onto village premises by an employee and used for business purposes, to the extent permitted by law. Personal property which is not a fixture of the worksite (such as a purse, briefcase, or lunch box) may be searched upon permission of the employee or for cause as part of an investigation, generally with the cooperation of law enforcement personnel. An inspection or search will typically be conducted based upon a reasonable suspicion of employee misconduct or criminal activity or for work-related purposes. The village may conduct an inspection or search at any time, with or without notice, at the discretion of the village. Inspectors or searches shall be conducted by village supervisors and/or their designees. The village reserves the right to seize all drugs, paraphernalia, weapons, or other contraband found on the village's premises and may turn over such evidence to the appropriate authorities. An employee who fails or refuses to comply with this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The acceptance of, or continued employment with this policy, constitutes consent to all of the provisions of this search policy. 
(Ord. No. 16-169, § 1, 10-13-2016)  
Sec. 62-82. - Workplace bullying. 
The village defines workplace bullying as repeated inappropriate behavior, either direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment. Such behavior violates the village's conduct policy, which clearly states that all employees will be treated with courtesy and respect. 
The purpose of this policy is to communicate to all employees that the village will not tolerate bullying behavior. Employees found in violation of this policy will be disciplined up to and including termination. 
Bullying may be intentional or unintentional. However, it must be noted that where an allegation of bullying is made, the intention of the alleged bully is irrelevant and will not be given consideration when meting out discipline. As with sexual harassment, it is the effect of the behavior upon the individual that is important. 
The village considers the following types of behavior examples of bullying: 
(1)  Verbal bullying : Slandering, ridiculing or maligning a person or his/her family; persistent name calling that is hurtful, insulting or humiliating; using a person as the butt of jokes; abusive and offensive remarks. 
(2)  Physical bullying : Pushing, shoving, kicking, poking, tripping, assault or threat of physical assault; damage to a person's work area or property. 
(3)  Gesture bullying : Nonverbal threatening gestures or glances that convey threatening messages. 
(4)  Exclusion : Socially or physically excluding or disregarding a person in work-related activities. 
(Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-83. - Americans with Disability Act policy. 
The village maintains an equal opportunity policy ("EEO Policy") for all applicants and employees. To supplement the village's EEO Policy and in response to the Americans With Disabilities Act, the village has adopted this additional policy statement regarding discrimination against the disabled. Equal employment opportunity for the disabled (and all other protected classes) is one of the village's goals and it is expected that all employees shall assist in furthering this goal. 
The village gives fair consideration to all qualified individuals with disabilities and affords all employees and applicants opportunities for advancement according to their individual abilities without regard to disability. No opportunity for hire, advancement, or any other condition of employment will be diminished through discriminatory practices. In accordance with the law, the village will also reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities. 
If an employee believes that he/she has been discriminated against or harassed in violation of this policy, or if he/she is a qualified individual with a disability who would like to request a reasonable accommodation, please contact the human resources director immediately. Because each individual is different, the village will discuss the particular situation the employee and undertake an investigation of the specific circumstances involved. The village's goal will be to take action which will provide equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities so long as they can perform the essential functions of their respective position.

Secs. 62-8462-90. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE IV. - COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS 
 
Sec. 62-91. - Pay policy. 
Compensation shall be governed by the salary ranges established for the particular position assigned. The village shall endeavor to make such compensation equitable and competitive with similar jurisdictions and positions. 
(1)  All full-time employees shall be paid at an annual rate computed to hours on the basis of 2,080 hours per year. During the 2012-2013 fiscal year, however, from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, full-time employees shall be paid at an annual rate computed to hours on the basis of 2,028 hours per year. 
(2)  Employees shall be paid biweekly on every other Friday. The two-week work period shall be considered to begin on the Monday prior to payday. 
(3)  Salary increases shall be as budgeted, warranted and recommended by the applicable department head.

(5)  Longevity increase. A one percent (1%) longevity raise will be given to all full-time village employees after each five (5) consecutive years of service. Longevity ceases to accrue when an employee's status shifts to part-time status; however, in the event a part-time employee subsequently returns to full-time status, longevity will resume from the date the employee left full-time status and went to part-time status. Similarly, if an employee leaves village employment in a full-time position due to a lay-off, and subsequently returns to full-time status, the employee's longevity will resume from the date the employee was separated due to lay-off. Longevity will not resume in situations where an employee voluntarily resigns or retires from employment with the village or is terminated for any other reason than lay-off should the employee return to the village in a full-time capacity. 
(6)  The village shall pay all employee compensation (excluding expense reimbursement) via electronic fund transfer (a/k/a direct deposit) to each employee's personal bank account at a banking institution of the employee's choice. Each employee shall timely provide the village with required information necessary for the village to effectuate said electronic fund transfer of compensation. 
(7)  Automatic payroll deductions are made for federal and state income tax purposes and for employee's pension contributions and social security, where applicable. Other authorized deductions, as approved by the village manager, may also be arranged for at the employee's request in accordance with the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, 820 ILCS 115/9. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 09-84, § 1, 6-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-35, § 1, 2-16-2010; Ord. No. 10-98, § 1, 6-7-2010; Ord. No. 12-94, § 1, 5-21-2012; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-92. - Hours of work. 
The standard workweek for all full-time non-exempt employees shall be five days and 40 hours, except from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, when the number of hours shall be reduced to 39. Exempt employees are required to work those hours necessary to assure the satisfactory performance of their duties within their departments, but not less than 40 hours per week, except from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, when the number of hours shall be reduced to 39. Supervisory exempt employees shall assign to each supervised employee regular work duties and responsibilities which can normally be accomplished within the established workday and workweek. However, occasionally some overtime work may be necessary for proper performance of work duties and responsibilities. For exempt employees, such overtime is considered part of their job responsibility and does not justify overtime pay. 
Regular hours of work shall be as follows: 
(1)  Fire department. Hours of work for employees of the fire department, excluding the fire chief, shall be established at the discretion of the fire chief. 
(2)  Police department. Hours of work for employees of the police department, excluding the chief of police, shall be established at the discretion of the chief of police.

(6)  Hours of duty. A minimum of eight hours of duty on five consecutive days in a calendar week to be interrupted each day by an unpaid meal period of not less than one-half hour beginning no later than five hours after the start of the duty period. The scheduling of the hours of duty shall be as determined by the department head. During the 2012-2013 fiscal year, however, from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, the hours of duty shall comprise a minimum of eight hours of duty on four days and a minimum of seven hours of duty one day in a calendar week. 
(7)  Rest breaks. Employees shall be permitted two 15 minute rest breaks during the normal workday, the time of which shall be scheduled and designated by the heads of the various departments. Alternatively, at the discretion of the applicable department head, the two 15 minute rest breaks may be combined with the half hour unpaid meal period to provide the employee a one hour meal period (half hour unpaid). 
(8)  Habitual tardiness. Employees who are late more than twice in any four week period, measured backwards from the last incident of tardiness, or employees who are habitually late on a continuous basis, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Each department may implement a more restrictive policy with respect to tardiness issues. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 08-186, §§ 1, 2, 12-1-2008; Ord. No. 09-84, § 1, 6-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-98, § 1, 6-7-2010; Ord. No. 12-94, § 1, 5-21-2012; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-93. - Overtime. 
Except as provided in section 62-92 and in any applicable collective bargaining agreements, the following will apply to overtime. 
(1)  Scheduled overtime. All scheduled overtime for non-exempt employees must be approved by the respective department head and authorized by the village manager. 
(2)  Emergency overtime. If a non-exempt employee receives notice of the need to work emergency overtime less than 12 hours before the time the duty is to commence, the employee shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half for hours so worked outside his or her scheduled workday (a minimum of two hours), plus one additional hour ("bonus pay") at the rate of time and one-half. Bonus pay will be paid only once in each 24-hour period. Bonus pay will not be paid for a continuation of less than two hours past the employee's scheduled work dismissal hour. 
(3)  Forty-hour rule. All non-exempt employees whose scheduled workweek is of at least 40 hours per week (except from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, the scheduled workweek is of at least 39 hours per week), excluding sick time and compensatory time, will be compensated at time and one-half for of all hours worked over 40 hours per week. 
(4)  Saturday, Sunday and holiday overtime for non-public safety personnel. With respect to Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, non-exempt employees shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half, provided the employees have worked a scheduled workweek of at least five days at eight hours per day (except during the 2012-2013 fiscal year, from May 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, the scheduled workweek shall comprise a minimum of eight hours of duty on four days and a minimum of seven hours of duty on one day in a calendar week), including village holidays, personal time, or vacation days' pay. However, unpaid time or sick time taken shall constitute forfeiture of the time and one-half rate and straight time shall be paid. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 09-55, § 1, 3-20-2009; Ord. No. 09-84, § 1, 6-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-98, § 1, 6-7-2010; Ord. No. 12-94, § 1, 5-21-2012; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-94. - Public works standby. 
(1)  A non-exempt employee who has been designated as "standby" will receive two hours of pay per day as overtime pay for each day they are so classified, regardless of whether or not they are called out to work for an emergency. In the event of a call out to work, the time and one-half rate will be applicable for all hours worked after an employee's punch-in until the employee's scheduled work hour, at which time the employee's rate of pay will revert to straight time until his regular shift time expires. A two hour minimum call out period will be applicable per occurrence unless the call out period overlaps with the employee's scheduled work hours or overlaps with another previous call out period for that employee. 
For example, if an employee is called out to work during an evening, weekend or holiday and only works 30 minutes, the employee still receives two hours minimum pay at time and one-half plus one hour of bonus pay as defined above. If work continues beyond the two hour period, the employee receives such at time and one-half. However, when on scheduled standby, the employee does not get the bonus pay as defined above. 
(2)  It is mandatory that an employee designated as a "standby" be available on 30 minutes' notice. Failure to respond to the notice in the allotted time shall constitute forfeiture of the standby pay due for that period and may be the basis for further disciplinary action. Employees who cannot consistently demonstrate that they can respond (punch in) within the required time frame will no longer be eligible for scheduled standby. Consistent response time will be considered a minimum of four on-time responses for any five consecutive call out notifications. 
(3)  Winter standby. During the winter season for a 16 week period starting the Monday following Thanksgiving Day and through approximately the end of March, up to six additional employees may be scheduled for winter standby. In all cases, the regularly scheduled standby employee will be contacted first. In the event that the meteorological emergency requires more than one employee to address, the balance of the scheduled winter standby employees will be notified to respond. Meteorological emergencies include storms (snow, rain, wind, or otherwise) and unanticipated water main breaks/repairs. 
(4)  A nonexempt employee who has been designated as "winter standby" will receive one hour of pay per day as overtime pay for each day they are so classified, regardless of whether or not they are called out for an emergency. In the event of a call out, the time and one-half rate will be applicable for all hours worked after punch-in until the employee's scheduled work hour, at which time the employee's rate of pay will revert to straight time until his regular shift time expires. A two hour minimum call out period will be applicable per occurrence unless call-out period overlaps with the employee's scheduled work hours or overlaps with another previous call-out period.

Holidays shall not be paid unless the employee shall have worked the scheduled workday immediately before and the scheduled workday immediately after the authorized holiday. An exception may be made for scheduled personal compensatory, and vacation days, verifiable illness, a death in the immediate family or unforeseen personal misfortune which can be confirmed. 
In place of time off for holidays, civilian police employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and all sworn police employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement will receive additional pay per year as outlined in the applicable collective bargaining agreements. In lieu of time off for holidays, police sergeants, whose schedule is not affected due to holidays, will receive an extra eight hours regular time pay for each holiday that falls within the pay period, regardless of whether they are on duty or not for that holiday. This holiday leave exception for police employees will not affect their receipt of personal days. 
Part-time employees, who work 16 or more hours per week, except part-time sworn police officers and paid-on-call firefighters, shall receive paid time off (four hours per holiday) for the holidays listed above excluding (11). 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 16-120, § 1, 7-7-2016; Ord. No. 16-196, § 1, 12-8-2016; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018; Ord. No. 19-041, § 2, 4-11-2019)  
Sec. 62-96. - Floating holidays. 
All full-time, regular employees will receive four floating holidays (32 hours) per year in addition to vacation time, sick leave and the village's regular holidays. These four floating holidays allow employees to have additional paid leave to cover absences for personal reasons, such as religious observances or parent-teacher conferences, or to supplement vacation, sick and holiday leave. 
Floating holidays are available at the beginning of each calendar year. Any employee hired in the first quarter of the calendar year will receive the full allotment of floating holidays for the year. Any employee hired in the second quarter of the calendar year will receive three floating holidays. Any employee hired in the third quarter of the calendar year will receive two floating holidays. Any employee hired in the fourth quarter of the calendar year will receive one floating holiday. 
Floating holidays may be used to cover a full or partial day (to be used in minimum of four-hour block) absence. They must be taken in the calendar year in which received. Under no circumstances will these days be carried over to the next calendar year, nor may they be cashed out if not taken or paid upon termination of employment. 
A floating holiday must be scheduled and approved in advance by the employee's immediate supervisor. As much notice should be provided as practical, however, a minimum seven calendar days' notice is expected. Supervisors may make exception in agreed cases of emergency which may be documented after the fact. All floating holidays are subject to approval by an employee's supervisor and such approval will depend on the maintenance of adequate staffing levels within the village.

Editor's note Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, adopted Jan. 4, 2018, amended § 62-96 and in so doing changed the title of said section from "Personal days" to "Floating days," as set out herein.  
Sec. 62-97. - Vacation policy. 
Vacations are provided for the recreation and relaxation of full-time employees. Vacation credit is earned by full-time employees on a regular basis with the schedule of vacation determined at the discretion of the respective department head. In determining the vacation schedule, the department head shall consider as factors the desires of the individual full-time employee in relation to all other requests for vacation or other leave of department employees, the needs and demands of village operations and the workload of the department. The following rules must be followed by all employees with respect to vacation time: 
(1)  Full-time employees shall request approval of vacation as far in advance of the dates requested as practicable. All requests for vacation shall be tentatively approved by the department head, subject to final approval of the village manager. 
(2)  Unused vacation time from the current year shall be paid to the employee at the time of separation from village service, whether such separation is voluntary or involuntary. In the event of a change in employment status from full-time to part-time, the village will pay unused vacation from the current year within 14 days of the change in status. If the employee subsequently returns to full-time status, vacation credit resumes from the date the employee left full-time status and went to part-time status. Similarly, if an employee leaves village employment due to a lay-off, and returns to village employment in a full-time position, the employee's vacation credit will resume from the date the employee was separated due to lay-off. Vacation credit will not resume in situations where an employee voluntarily resigns or retires from employment with the village or is terminated for any other reason than lay-off should the employee return to the village in a full-time capacity. 
(3)  Vacation shall not be advanced. Vacation time earned in one year shall not carry over to the next calendar year. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 10-35, § 1, 2-16-2010; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)

Education reimbursement monies shall only be applied to the verified cost of tuition and registration, which have been approved by the department head and village manager subject to availability of budgeted funds. 
Proof of completion of the approved coursework shall consist of a transcript showing a letter grade of "B" or better, or in cases where no letter grade is given, a certificate of completion or written proof that the coursework was completed in a satisfactory manner. Requests for reimbursement may be submitted to the department head and must be accompanied by a receipt for all eligible expenses incurred. 
(b)  (1)  The village shall reimburse a maximum of $350.00 for education program expenses for the 12 month period from May 1April 30 each year except as provided below in section (b)(2). Requests for reimbursement for completed approved college or professional level educational course work will be paid for the 12 month period (May 1April 30) in which requests are received by the department head. 
(b)  (2)  If the entire $350.00 of education reimbursement referred to in section (b)(1) above is used solely for college-level course work and college related eligible expenses at an accredited college or university, then the employee shall be eligible to receive an additional $1,250.00 of educational reimbursement for additional college course work and college related eligible expenses. 
(c)  If an employee receives tuition payments or refunds from other sources for college-level course work at an accredited college or university, the village will contribute the difference between the amount the employee receives from the other source and the authorized costs incurred by the employee to the maximum cited in section (b) above. 
Stipulations: 
(1)  All courses should attempt to be taken other than during employee's regular work hours unless vacation time is used and department head approval has been given. As a general condition approval of course work during regular work hours will not occur except in very unique circumstances. 
(2)  There should be a reasonable assurance that the employee intends to remain an active village employee for at least one year after completion of course work in order to qualify for tuition assistance at public expense. If an employee seeks and receives approval to receive tuition reimbursement he or she must be willing to sign an "Educational Reimbursement Payback Agreement" and abide by the conditions of that agreement. 
(3)  Employees on worker's compensation shall remain eligible for the tuition reimbursement program. 
(4)  Reimbursement will not be made to an employee who was discharged or voluntarily terminates employment with the village before completion of a course(s) enrolled in. 
(5)  Reimbursement will not be made to an employee who withdraws from a course(s) due to personal reasons. 
If an employee is laid off for reasons beyond their control, subsequent to the approval enrollment, eligibility for reimbursement will continue through satisfactory completion of the course(s) currently enrolled in.

Sec. 62-101. - Employee bonus incentive program. 
The village utilizes an employee bonus incentive program ("incentive program") available to all full-time employees. The incentive program was established in order to reward those employees who generate cost saving ideas for the village. The incentive program is further described in the village policy, "suggestion recognition and incentive program." The incentive program shall be administered by the village manager pursuant to the above policy. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-102. - Conference and travel policy. 
The village utilizes a conference and travel policy ("conference and travel policy") which sets criteria for payment and reimbursement of travel expenses incurred by the village president, village board of trustees, village employees and members of all village boards and commissions in the performance of their official functions. The conference and travel policy, which may be amended from time to time, sets forth the rules governing conferences and travel for official village functions. The conference and travel policy shall be distributed to all elected officials, employees and board and commission members, and kept on file with the village manager and village clerk. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)

In order for the plan sponsor to offer continuation coverage under COBRA, the employee must notify the human resources director of the applicable change in status that may qualify for extension of coverage under COBRA within 60 days of the qualifying event. Failure to properly notify the human resource director may result in extension of coverage being denied to the participant.

Sec. 62-104. - Furlough hoursThirty-nine hour work week. 
For the fiscal year 2012-2013, effective May 1, 2012 until April 30, 2013 unless extended by ordinance, for all full-time non-union employees, excluding police sergeants, the standard workweek shall be five days and 39 hours. Exempt employees are required to work those hours necessary to assure the satisfactory performance of their duties within their departments, but not less than 39 hours per week. Supervisory exempt employees shall assign to each supervised employee regular work duties and responsibilities which can normally be accomplished within the established workday and workweek. However, occasionally some overtime work may be necessary for proper performance of work duties and responsibilities. For exempt employees, such overtime is considered part of their job responsibility and does not justify overtime pay. 
Hours of work for employees shall be determined by department heads. 
(1)  Overtime. All scheduled overtime for non-exempt employees, including the 40 th hour which will be paid at the regular rate of pay, must be approved by the respective department heads and authorized by the village manager. 
All emergency overtime policies remain in effect and all emergency overtime worked outside of the employee(s scheduled workday will be paid at the rate of time and one-half, as described in the village employee handbook. 
All non-exempt employees whose scheduled workweek is of at least 39 hours per week, excluding sick time, will be compensated at time and one-half for all hours worked over 40 hours per week. Time worked between 39 and 40 hours will be compensated at the regular rate of pay. 
With respect to Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, non-exempt employees shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half, provided the employees have worked a scheduled workweek of at least four days at eight hours per day and one day at seven hours, including village holidays, personal time, or vacation days' pay. However, unpaid time or sick time taken shall constitute forfeiture of the time and one-half rate and straight time shall be paid. If employees have worked the scheduled workweek of 39 hours, if the 40 th hour is on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the 40 th hour will be paid at the overtime rate. 
(2)  Vacation. Vacation time will continue to be awarded as follows: Eighty hours per year after one year of consecutive full-time employment; 120 hours per year after five years of consecutive full-time employment; 160 hours per year after ten years of consecutive full-time employment; and 200 hours per year after 20 years of consecutive full-time employment. 
(3)  Paid time off. All paid time off (PTO) will be taken based on how many hours the employee was scheduled to work. For an entire week of PTO, an employee would use 39 hours. An employee would use eight hours of PTO to be paid for a day in which he or she was scheduled to work eight hours. The employee would use seven hours of PTO to be paid for a day in which he or she was scheduled to work seven hours. 
Employees may not use PTO for time during which they were not scheduled to increase their weekly hours. 
(4)  Holidays. All village approved holidays will be paid at eight hours. If a holiday falls on a day in workday, the shortened day will need to be rescheduled for that week so that the total workweek hours, including the eight hours of holiday pay do not exceed the 39 hour work week. 
(5)  Insurance. Employees who work 39 hours will continue to maintain full time employee status and as such are eligible for the same insurance coverage which any employee who previously worked a 40 hour workweek was eligible. 
(Ord. No. 09-84, § 1, 6-1-2009; Ord. No. 10-98, § 1, 6-7-2010; Ord. No. 12-94, § 1, 5-21-2012; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-105. - Paid time off (PTO) bankPart-time employees. 
Part-time employees, who work 16 or more hours a week, except part-time sworn police officers and paid-on-call firefighters, shall be eligible for paid time off (PTO) as described in this section. 
(1)  This policy is in effect for all part-time employees as described above. 
(2)  No PTO shall be available until the completion of the first anniversary of consecutive regular part-time employment. 
(3)  Employees requesting to use PTO for a planned absence are required to request PTO from their supervisor as far in advance of the dates requested as practicable, in accordance with vacation policy section of the personnel policy as applies to full-time employees. All requests shall be tentatively approved by the department head, subject to final approval of the village manager. 
(4)  Employees who need to use PTO for an unplanned absence, need to give notification to the supervisor at least 30 minutes before the start of their shift. Employees are required to give their supervisor the reason for the unplanned absence, such as illness of themselves, their spouse, or any member of their immediate household. Use of PTO for illness is not to be abused by the employee and excessive absenteeism will not be tolerated. The village reserves the right to require the employee to verify illness of themselves, their spouse, or any member of their immediate household via a healthcare provider's note or any other communication deemed appropriate by the village. 
(5)  Unused PTO from the current year shall be paid to the employee at the time of separation from village service, whether such separation is voluntary or involuntary. 
(6)  PTO shall not be advanced. PTO awarded in one year shall not carry over to the next anniversary year. 
(7)  Part-time regular employees will be awarded PTO according to the following schedule: 
a.  Two weeks (proportionate to hours worked the previous year) after one year consecutive service. 
b.  Three weeks (proportionate to hours worked the previous year) after five years consecutive service. 
(8)  Full-time regular employees with less than one year of full-time service and who were part-time employees immediately preceding becoming full-time employees, will be awarded PTO on their regular part-time anniversary according to the following schedule: 
a.  Two weeks (proportionate to hours worked as a part-time employee the previous year) after one year consecutive service. 
b  Three weeks (proportionate to hours worked as a part-time employee the previous year) after five years consecutive service. 
(Ord. No. 16-195, § 1, 12-8-2016; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-106. - Compensatory time policy. 
Non-exempt (hourly) employees who are eligible to be compensated for overtime as identified in section 62-93 or 62-94 will have the option of receiving cash overtime pay (same pay period) or compensatory time (accumulated at the same rate) up to a cap of 48 replenishable hours to be used as paid time off. If a non-exempt employee fails to specify how the individual over-time segments should be received, it will default to the method established by the department head for that position which will be communicated in writing to department staff, department administrative assistants, finance department, and human resources. 
On the first pay period in December and the last pay period in April, a non-exempt employee may elect to be paid out for any amount of unused compensatory time. On the last pay period in April, a non-exempt employee will be paid out for any amount of unused compensatory time over 24 hours in their comp time bank at the employee's then current rate of pay. In the event that a non-exempt employee is promoted to an exempt position, before the effective date of the promotion, the employee will be paid out for any unused compensatory time, accumulated as a non-exempt employee. Unused compensatory time will be paid out to a non-exempt employee at the time of separation from village service, whether that separation is voluntary or involuntary. 
Exempt employees accumulate compensatory time at the rate of one hour for each regular hour of actual work in excess of 40 hours per week. In terms of exempt employees accumulating compensatory time, paid time off including holiday, vacation, personal, or other compensatory time, are not included as regular hours of actual work. Exempt employees can use no more than eight hours of compensatory time in any given pay period, unless otherwise directed by the village manager. Exempt employees may only use compensatory time accrued in the previous two pay periods in addition to time within same pay period. Exempt employees will not be paid out for any unused compensatory time. 
For both non-exempt and exempt employees, the use of compensatory time shall be by mutual agreement between the employee and their supervisor, as scheduling permits. 
(Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-107. - Insurance benefits policy and procedure. 
(a)  Purpose. To document policy and procedure regarding eligibility of insurance benefits for full and part time employees of the village (also known as Policy PP-26, effective 12/01/2012). 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) establishes certain regulations for individuals and employers and requires compliance over a specific time frame some of which will be addressed in this policy. 
(b)  Eligibility . 
(1)  Full-time employees. All full-time employees, as defined in section 62-2(1), except for specific job classifications as described below, are eligible to participate in the village's group major medical, dental, and life insurance programs.

(3)  Part-time fire department employees. This classification consists of paid-on-call and part-time fire department personnel that receive an hourly wage for hours worked. They are not salaried. Overtime is calculated based on 106 hours per two-week pay period for operations personnel and 40 hours per week for administrative personnel (EMA, administrative assistants, fire inspectors).

Only certain paid-on-call and part-time fire department personnel are eligible to participate in the village's life insurance program as described in the life insurance section of this policy. 
Full-time village employees that are also paid-on-call or part-time fire department personnel working under a 7G agreement are paid according to those agreements. By virtue of their full-time positions, these personnel are treated the same as all other full- time village employees for benefit purposes. 
(c)  Group major medical insurance. 
(1)  Full-time employees. The village will pay for a portion of the cost of the coverage in accordance with village policies as established by the village board prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. Each employee electing such coverage shall be obligated to pay the remaining portion of the cost for his/her own coverage as well as the portion of the cost of family coverage if elected as determined by the village board prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. Employees who opt to not be covered by the village's group major medical insurance will be paid an annual stipend of $2,000.00 (paid out in 26 checks), or such other amount as may be determined by the village board from time to time. 
(2)  Part-time employees. The village will pay for a small portion of the cost (11.5 percent) of the coverage in accordance with village policies. Each employee electing such coverage shall be obligated to pay the remaining portion of the cost for his/her own coverage as well as the portion of the cost of family coverage (88.5 percent). 
(3)  Part-time fire department employees. The village will pay for a small portion of the cost (11.5 percent) of the coverage in accordance with village policies. Each employee electing such coverage shall be obligated to pay the remaining portion of the cost for his/her own coverage as well as the portion of the cost of family coverage (88.5 percent). 
The Village may also provide a low benefit, low cost option designed to cover 60 percent of the cost of care. 
(d)  Group dental insurance. 
(1)  Full-time employees. Group dental insurance shall be made available to all full-time employees and their families. If elected, insurance coverage shall commence after 30 days of full-time continuous employment with the village. The village will pay for a portion of the cost of the coverage in accordance with village policies as established by the village board prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. Each employee electing such coverage shall be obligated to pay the portion for family coverage if elected as determined by the village board prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. 
(2)  Part-time employees. The village will pay for a small portion of the cost (11.5 percent) of the coverage in accordance with village policies. Each employee electing such coverage shall be obligated to pay the remaining portion of the cost for his/her own coverage as well as the portion of the cost of family coverage (88.5 percent). 
(e)  Life insurance. A term life insurance policy with a minimum of $50,000.00 coverage shall be provided at the village's cost for any full-time employee while he/she is employed by the village. This life insurance policy terminates upon termination of employment except upon retirement when a retiree may opt to retain the life insurance policy at their cost. 
Any paid-on-call member or part-time firefighter who works a minimum of 780 hours or more in a calendar year will be eligible for this life insurance, effective for the calendar immediately following a 780 hour year. Example: Firefighter works 780 hours from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011. The firefighter is eligible for life insurance for January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012. This life insurance policy terminates upon termination of employment. 
(f)  Health care reform. According to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the only insurance benefit an employer must offer to an employee designated to be full-time according to this Act, is health insurance. Health insurance includes major medical, prescription, and may include vision. 
(1)  Designation of full-time and part-time . The designation of an employee as full-time or part-time in this section simply identifies if they are considered a full-time employee in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The classifications in this health care reform section should not be confused with the classifications in the above eligibility section. 
Employees that are designated as full-time for the purposes of this section, will be able to receive insurance. However, the contributions required for that insurance will be based on the employee's classification in the eligibility section, as applied to the various insurance benefits as described in their specific sections. Employees that are designated as part-time for the purposes of this section, may also be able to receive insurance as described above. 
(2)  Standard measurement period (SMP). The SMP is the look back period to determine if the employee has worked an average of 30 hours per week. The village's SMP is November 1 through October 31 of each year. 
(3)  Stability period. If an employee averages 30 hours per week, the employee is considered full-time for the stability period. If the employee averages less than 30 hours per week, the employee is considered part-time for the stability period. The village's stability period is from January 1 through December 31 of each year. 
If an employee's hours change such that their status changes from FT to PT or PT to FT during the stability period, no changes will occur in insurance designation either way. Example: An employee is determined to be full-time during the SMP and elects to enroll in the village's insurance. If the employee's hours drop substantially and the employee essentially becomes part-time again, the employee will remain classified as a full-time employee for the purpose of Health Care Reform and may remain enrolled in insurance until the stability period has ended; after such time the employee may be eligible for COBRA. 
(4)  Administrative period The administrative period is the time allowed for eligible employee to decide whether or not to enroll in the village's insurance and time for village staff to administer the enrollment. The village's administrative period is November 1 through December 31 of each year.

Secs. 62-10862-130. - Reserved.  
ARTICLE V. - LEAVES OF ABSENCE 
 
Sec. 62-131. - Sick leave. 
Sick leave is a privilege, not a right, extended to all full-time employees. Sick leave is accrued on the basis of eight hours for each full month of service. Sick leave may not be used as additional vacation time. Abuse of sick leave privileges is sufficient cause for discipline, up to and including termination of employment with the village. Further, employees may not convert pre-established paid leave (vacation, compensatory time, or personal time) to sick leave. 
(1)  Reporting. In cases where an employee cannot report for duty due to illness, the employee must advise his or her supervisor or department no later than 30 minutes before the employee's scheduled starting time on the day of the absence. 
(2)  Doctor's certificate required. Supervisors may require a doctor's certificate from employees who are absent due to illness. A doctor's certificate will be required in all cases where absences are three or more consecutive work days or any absence adjacent to other paid time off. At the village's discretion, employees may also be required to submit to a medical examination by a physician designated by the village. Sick leave shall not be payable if, in the opinion of the village physician, the absence was not necessary. 
(3)  Change in employment status. In the event of a change in employment status from full-time to part-time, any unused sick time will remain on the books and can be used during the part-time status. 
(4)  Longevity/retirement sick leave payout. Provided that an employee has given proper notice of separation, an employee shall be paid for unused and accrued sick leave up to a maximum of 120 working days upon such employee's separation from village service, only where that employee has served 20 or more consecutive years of full-time employment with the village, or if such employee has reached the minimum retirement age and has become vested in the applicable pension fund to be paid out at the following payout schedule: 
a.  For employees hired prior to January 1, 2018, they will be paid 100 percent for unused and accrued sick leave up to a maximum of 120 working days. 
b.  For employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, they will be paid 50 percent for unused and accrued sick leave up to a maximum of 120 working days. 
An employee who is terminated, laid off, or otherwise dismissed by the village is not eligible for sick leave payout. An employee who receives notice of layoff who subsequently gives notice to retire or resign prior to the effective date of the layoff may still be eligible for sick leave payout if he/she meets the requirements of this subsection (4). 
(5)  An employee also may use sick leave benefits accrued pursuant to this section 62-131 for absences due to an illness, injury, or medical appointments of the employee's "covered family member", for reasonable periods of time as the employee's attendance may be necessary, on the same terms upon which an employee is able to use sick leave benefits for the employee's own illness or injury. Provided, however, sick leave benefits taken by any employee for a "covered family member" is limited to the amount that the employee would accrue during six months of employment (i.e., up to 48 hours which is half of 96 hours accrued/year maximum). This limitation applies to non-FMLA absences. For purposes of this section 62-131 only, the phrase "covered family member" means the employee's child, spouse, civil union or domestic partner, sibling, parent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchild, grandparent or stepparent.

Sec. 62-132. - Bereavement leave. 
Full-time village employees may be granted emergency leave of absence with pay in cases of death of an immediate family member. Such leave shall be granted only upon the recommendation of an employee's department head, and is subject to approval by the village manager. Upon approval, such employees may be granted and compensated for up to a maximum of three consecutive working days for bereavement leave. Paid leave for this purpose will not be granted in instances where the bereavement leave occurs on a paid holiday, previously scheduled days off, weekends, or in any case where payment under this section would result in paying twice for the same time off. Further, employees may not convert pre-established paid leave (vacation, compensatory time, or personal time) to bereavement leave. However, if circumstances require more than the maximum three days paid bereavement leave, department heads shall consider the short-notice approval of other available vacation or personal time off. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-133. - Jury duty. 
Full-time village employees shall receive full pay for time not worked while serving on jury duty or testifying as a witness at the request of the village, or testifying under subpoena to matters related to their employment with the village. Such employees are required to endorse to the village any payment received for such jury or witness duty. No employee shall receive pay for time not worked while testifying as a witness in a case filed by the employee against the village, its officers or employees. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-134. - Military service. 
Employees inducted into active military service will, upon application, be granted a leave of absence for the period of military service, and shall be reinstated without loss of seniority or other benefits, provided they return to village service within 90 days after release from military service. Employees who are members of a reserve or national guard unit will be granted a leave of absence for periods of active military service and shall be reinstated without loss of seniority or other benefits, provided they return to village service immediately after release from active duty. If a member of a reserve or national guard unit is mobilized by presidential order, a leave of absence and reinstatement shall be granted in the same manner as if the employee was inducted into active military service. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007)  
Sec. 62-135. - Absences due to job related injuries. 
Village employees may be eligible to benefits under the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act for injuries sustained in the course of employment. Such eligibility and benefits are set forth in the Illinois Workers' Compensation laws. A copy of the "Handbook on Workers' Compensation and Occupational Diseases" is available from human resources or at www.iwcc.il.gov. 
(a)  Reporting an on-the-job injury : If an employee believes he/she has suffered an injury or illness related to employment with the village, the employee must immediately report the injury or illness to a supervisor, or no later than the end of the business day on which the injury occurred. All injuries, including those that do not require emergency medical care must be reported. Injuries that do not require medical care are reported on an employee first aid/incident report. Upon being advised of an injury or illness, the employee's supervisor will complete an Illinois Industrial Commission Form 45 (also known as the Employer's First Report of Injury or Illness), and a supervisor's accident investigation report (see human resources or the employee intranet for copies of these forms). The employee will complete the employee statement form, and any witnesses will complete the witness statement form. The originals of all reports along with any other related data and pictures shall be completed and emailed to our third party claims administrator (IRMA) as well as to human resources within 48 hours of receiving notice of the incident. The departmental safety committees shall review copies of the reports as well as the executive safety committee. 
(1)  The director or supervisor of a department shall contact the risk manager (human resources director) immediately, at any time, 24 hours a day, in the event of an injury or illness, or of a death. 
(2)  Upon receiving verbal notice of an injury or illness requiring emergency medical care, or death; or after receiving the completed reports of a less serious injury or illness, the risk manager (human resources director) will follow up on the claim with the village's third party claims administrator. 
(b)  Adjudication of a workers' compensation claim . The village's third party claims administrator will, in conjunction with the risk manager (human resources director), investigate the circumstances surrounding the injury, illness, or death of an employee. In accordance with applicable law, the third party claims administrator will determine if the employee's injury, illness, or death is compensable. If the claim for benefits is determined to be compensable, the third party claims administrator shall distribute all appropriate benefits. If the claim is determined not to be compensable, the third party administrator will notify the employee, or beneficiary if a death, in writing of the denial. If an employee disagrees with the determination made by the third party claims administrator, or for any other reason, the employee is entitled to file a claim for adjustment with the Illinois Industrial Commission. 
(c)  Benefits while on a workers' compensation absence . In the event the third party claims administrator determines that the injury, illness, or death is compensable, employees are entitled to, but not limited to, the following benefits: 
(1)  Medical benefits. The village will pay all medical bills related to an employee's injury or illness that are determined to be reasonable and customary by the third party claims administrator. Employees requiring medical treatment while on duty will be directed to the village's occupational health provider. The name and location of the occupational health provider is posted in all village facilities. Employees needing care will be treated and if necessary transported to an emergency care facility. Employees receiving medical treatment must forward all medical bills to the risk manager (human resources director). 
(2)  Light duty. The village makes every effort to return employees to work in a light duty capacity during recovery within the scope of specific work restrictions as determined by a health care provider. 
It is the responsibility of all employees to notify the treating health care providers of the village's availability of light duty, as well as notifying the department when released for light duty work. 
(3)  Injured on duty. For the first three days an employee is authorized off work by the treating health care provider due to an injury or illness, the employee must use time from accrued sick leave, or any other category of paid time off leave if the employee does not have sick leave remaining; unless PEDA applies (see below). 
(4)  Temporary total disability (TTD). Employees authorized off work for more than three days are entitled to temporary total disability (TTD) benefits. TTD benefits are paid at 66-2/3 percent of employee's average weekly wage. Average weekly wages are calculated on injured employee's regular wages for the 52 weeks prior to the date of injury. Employees are entitled to TTD benefits for as long as the employee is authorized off work due to the injury or illness, or until the employee has reached maximum medical improvement as determined by a health care provider. However, these TTD benefits are released to the village, as the employee receives their full rate of pay during the time of authorized injury or illness. 
(5)  Permanent partial disability (PPD). An employee may suffer a permanent partial disability (PPD) as a result of an injury or illness. An employee may be entitled to compensation for this disability. The Workers' Compensation Act determines the amount of PPD compensation. 
(6)  Permanent total disability (PTD). If an employee reaches the maximum medical improvement and is still medically unable to return to work, the employee may be entitled to permanent total disability benefits (PTD). These benefits are paid at a rate determined under the Workers' Compensation Act. 
(7)  Survivors benefits. In the event of an employee's death, spouses and dependents are eligible for survivor's benefits as determined under the Workers' Compensation Act. 
(8)  Public Employees Disability Act (PEDA). For the duration of up to one year, under the Public Employees Disability Act (PEDA), a sworn police or fire employee is eligible for compensation equal to 100 percent of their salary if the employee is off work due to a compensable injury or illness that occurred on duty. 
(9)  Illinois municipal retirement fund (IMRF) employees. TTD payments received by an employee due an on-the-job injury or illness are not considered 'earnings' by IMRF. Such time off of work, although authorized and receiving TTD payments, does not count as service time for the purpose of calculating future pension benefits. IMRF service time may be received during such periods by applying for an IMRF disability on forms available through IMRF or human resources. 
An employee is only entitled to lost time benefits if a health care provider authorizes time off work due to a compensable injury or illness. Upon returning to work after an injury or illness, the employee will be required to use benefit time, other than workers' compensation benefits, to attend any medical appointment during scheduled hours of work. IRMA does not pay TTD payments for work time missed to attend medical appointments during scheduled work hours unless attending a medical appointment requested by the village. 
(d)  Release to return to work . An employee authorized off work or released to a light duty assignment must have a duty status report completed by the treating health care provider.

Sec. 62-136. - Family Medical Leave Act. 
Employees who have worked for the village for the past 12 months, and for at least 1,250 hours, may request up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in accordance with the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"). Such leave may be requested for the following reasons: 
 The birth and care of the newborn child of an employee; 
 The placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; 
 To care for an immediate family member (defined by FMLA as a spouse, child or parent) with a serious health condition; 
 To take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of serious health condition; or 
 Because of any "qualifying exigency" (as defined by the Secretary of Labor) arising out of the fact that your spouse, child, or parent is deployed on active duty in a foreign country (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in the Armed Forces. 
The employee requesting FMLA leave shall make a written request, stating the reasons for such request, and the date desired for the start of the leave and probable date of return to work. FMLA leave shall not exceed a maximum combined total of 12 weeks in any 12 month period. 
FMLA leave is further explained within the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 and within the village's policy entitled "Family Medical Leave Act Policy and Procedure." 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 12-128, § 1, 8-6-2012)  
Sec. 62-137. - General leaves of absence. 
(a)  [General leave.] Village full-time employees may request a general unpaid leave of absence for personal matters. The decision to grant such leave shall be at the sole discretion of the village manager. Such leave may be requested for: 
(1)  The continuation or completion of a certificate, or pursuit of an accredited degree related to employment; 
(2)  To recover from a physical illness or to attend to a family illness not covered by FMLA; 
(3)  To take care of other personal matters not covered by FMLA. 
(b)  Procedure. Employees may submit a written request to their department head asking for a leave of absence without pay pursuant to this section. The request must state forth the reasons for the request, the date desired for the start of the leave and the probable date of return. The request will be reviewed by the department head and village manager. An employee is required to exhaust any available paid vacation, personal, and compensatory time before unpaid general leave of absence is commenced. 
(c)  Benefits. If a leave of absence pursuant to this section exceeds 30 consecutive calendar days, the employee may, at the employee's option, remain a member of any group hospital or medical plan provided by the village to its employees, provided the employee pays the full monthly premium for such coverage to the village. The employee is required to begin paying this premium beginning on the 31st consecutive day of leave. The premium shall include or exclude coverage for dependents at the option of the employee. 
(d)  Extension of other benefits. The village manager may extend health/life insurance coverage for up to 24 months to long tenure full-time employees when an employee can show good cause for such an extension. "Long tenure" is defined as employment with the village for at least five years. An employee taking a leave of absence pursuant to this section is not entitled to accrue any other employment benefit during the leave, including, but not limited to, vacation, sick and holiday leave. 
(e)  Resignation. A village employee who fails to return from a general leave of absence pursuant to this section on the designated return date, either as originally agreed or as extended by agreement, shall be considered as having resigned his or her employment position with the village. 
(Ord. No. 07-156, 10-15-2007; Ord. No. 13-168, § 1, 8-8-2013)  
Sec. 62-138. - Illinois Pregnancy Accommodation Act. 
The village complies with the Illinois Pregnancy Accommodation Act (the "Act"), 775 ILCS 5/1, et seq. Generally, the Act prohibits discrimination against females based on pregnancy and childbirth and covers job applicants as well as part-time, full-time and probationary employees. It further gives protected individuals opportunities to request reasonable accommodations for medical or common conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth. 
Employees should not rely on the first paragraph of this subsection to become fully informed about the Act or its implications. Understanding the protections, obligations and remedies provided by the Act requires review of the entire Act. A copy of the Act may be reviewed and/or obtained at the website of the Illinois Department of Human Rights (www.illinois.gov/dhr) or from the village's human resources department. The village has displayed posters required by the Act at various prominent locations in village buildings. 
(Ord. No. 18-006a, § 2, 1-4-2018)  
Sec. 62-139. - Victim's Economic Security and Safety Act (VESSA). 
(a)  Policy and requirements. In accordance with the Illinois Victims' Economic Security and Safety Act, 820 ILCS 180/1, et seq., (VESSA), an employee is entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year, and/or reasonable accommodations for one of the following reasons: 
 To seek medical attention for, or recovering from, physical or psychological injuries caused by domestic or sexual violence to the employee or an employee's family or household member; or 
 To obtain services from a victim services organization for the employee or an employee's family or household member; or 
 To obtain psychological or other counseling for the employee or an employee's family or household member; or 
 To participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocating or taking other actions to increase the safety of the employee or an employee's family or household member from future domestic or sexual violence or to ensure economic security; or 
 To seek legal assistance or remedies to ensure the health and safety of the employee or an employee's family or household member, including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceeding related to or derived from domestic or sexual violence. 
An eligible employee is entitled to up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during a rolling 12 month period from the date of occurrence. Said leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced work schedule basis. VESSA leave will run concurrently with any other applicable leave. For instance, leave taken under VESSA which also qualifies under FMLA, will be simultaneously designated as both VESSA and FMLA leave. Likewise, absences for which an employee receives short term disability benefits for a purpose covered under VESSA will be designated as VESSA leave. 
An employee can substitute, or the village may require substitution of, available paid vacation, sick, personal or similar leave for unpaid VESSA leave as is appropriate for the employee's situation. Such paid leave must be taken in accordance with the terms of this policy. The substitution of paid leave for unpaid leave under VESSA does not extend the 12 week leave period. In the event there is no deduction made for health insurance premiums, the employee is responsible for remitting payment to the village for monthly premiums. 
The employee is required to provide the village with at least 48 hours advance notice, if possible, of the employee's intention to take a VESSA leave. If the employee is unable to provide advance notice, the employee must provide notice when the employee is able to do so within a reasonable period of time. Failure to provide the required notice may result in treatment of the absences as unexcused. 
The employee is required to submit a certification that the employee or the employee's family or household member is a victim of domestic or sexual violence and that a leave is needed for one of the listed VESSA purposes. This VESSA certification may be satisfied by a sworn statement from the employee and other corroborating evidence (police or court record, documentation from a victim service organization, attorney, clergy or medical professional), once received by the employee. 
(b)  Definitions . 
Domestic violence means domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking. 
Family or household member , means a spouse, parent, son, daughter, other person related by blood or by present or prior marriage, other person who shares a relationship through a son or daughter, and persons jointly residing in the same household. 
Parent means the biological parent of an employee or an individual who stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child. 
Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is under 18 years of age, or is 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability. 
(c)  Insurance payments . While on VESSA leave, the employee and the village shall continue to pay for their proportionate share of the village's group health, dental and vision coverage, if the employee is enrolled in said plans at the time VESSA leave starts. Failure of the employee to make the employee's proportionate health, dental and vision insurance payments may result in cessation of coverage for the employee. The village can recover the cost of any premiums paid on behalf of an employee on VESSA leave who fails to return to work after exhausting their leave, unless the continuation, recurrence or onset of domestic or sexual violence or an event beyond the employee's control prevents their return. 
(d)  Confidentiality . All information provided to the village shall be retained in the strictest confidence, except to the extent that disclosure is requested or consented to in writing by the employee or otherwise required by applicable federal or state law. 
(e)  Accruals . During a VESSA leave, pension service will continue to accrue in certain circumstances; however, no sick, vacation, personal or holiday leave benefits, or seniority benefits will accrue to the employee during an unpaid leave. An employee remains entitled to their benefit time that accrued prior to the leave. An employee on VESSA leave is encouraged to discuss these potential accruals with the human resources department. 
(f)  Employee status after VESSA leave . If an employee wishes to return to work at the expiration of the employee's leave, the employee is entitled to return to the same position or to an equivalent position with equal pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment. If an employee takes leave because of the employee's own medical condition, the employee is required to provide medical certification that the employee is fit to resume work. 
(g)  Reasonable accommodations . The village supports VESSA and will attempt to provide reasonable accommodations in a timely fashion for employees who are entitled to reasonable accommodations under VESSA, unless such accommodations would present an undue hardship for the Village or unless the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job even with the reasonable accommodation or unless reasonable accommodations are not required by law. 
Reasonable accommodation applies to employees who are otherwise qualified individuals and may include adjustment to a job structure, workplace facility, or work requirement, transfer, reassignment, or modified schedule, leave, a changed telephone number or seating assignment, installation of a lock, implementation of a safety procedure or assistance in documenting domestic or sexual violence that occurs at the workplace or in work-related settings, in response to actual or threatened domestic or sexual violence. 
A qualified individual is an individual who, but for being a victim of domestic or sexual violence or with a family or household member who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. 
Should an employee wish to request a reasonable accommodation pursuant to this policy, the employee should contact the human resources director in writing.

Sec. 62-140. - Voting leave. 
The village encourages its employees to exercise their right to vote. In accordance with the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/17-15, an employee will be permitted up to two hours of paid leave for voting purposes during a general or special election, unless the employee has time to vote before or after work while the polls are open. Such leave will be granted only if the employee's normal work schedule begins less than two hours after the opening of polls and ends less than two hours before the closing of polls. Employees should notify their supervisors at least one day in advance of the absence. The supervisor may specify the hours during which the employee may be excused with pay to vote.

Sec. 62-141. - School visitation leave. 
If an employee finds it necessary to attend school conferences or classroom activities for their dependent children, the employee may be granted up to a total of eight hours each school year, with a maximum of four hours per occurrence. An employee must use all vacation leave, personal leave, compensatory leave, and any other leave except sick leave and disability leave, prior to non-paid time off approval in accordance with the School Visitation Rights Act, 820 ILCS 147/1. An employee must also provide the village with a written request for leave at least seven days in advance unless it is an emergency situation, in which case 24 hours' notice is required.

ARTICLE VI. - DISCIPLINE 
 
Sec. 62-156. - General/at-will employment. 
(a)  Except for employees who may be subject to a separate contract or agreement, or the rules and regulations of the fire and police commission, village employees are "at will" employees and may be dismissed from employment at any time, with or without cause. Adverse actions taken regarding an employee shall be classified as disciplinary or non-disciplinary in nature. 
(b)  Village employees are expected to maintain reasonable standards of performance and conduct. Employees are to use good judgment in their positions and treat other employees and citizens of the village properly. The village has established certain guidelines, rules and procedures regarding disciplinary actions which must be followed by employees. However, none of these guidelines, rules and procedures are intended to create a requirement of cause for termination of an employee. 
(c)  Although village employees may be discharged from employment with or without cause, when a disciplinary action is involved, the village supervisor shall take into account the seriousness of an offense, the employee's previous work record, and any other relevant information, when determining the type of discipline appropriate for an offense. It is the general policy of the village to apply progressive discipline where possible and practical. However, progressive discipline is not mandatory, and employees who commit serious first offenses will receive appropriate discipline, up to and including termination of employment. 
(d)  Nothing described in this section shall apply to reductions in force or reassignments due to reorganization or economic decisions of the village as further described in section 62-237 herein. The village retains the sole right to determine staffing level needs and organizational structure. Employee demotions, transfers, reassignments or discharges arising out of such reorganizations or reductions in force shall not be considered disciplinary action pursuant to this section.

Sec. 62-158. - General procedure for disciplinary action. 
Disciplinary action may range from oral notification of an employee's unsatisfactory performance, written reprimand, suspension and/or termination of employment. 
(1)  Oral notification to employee of unacceptable performance. Should an employee's performance, attitude, work habits or personal conduct fall below an acceptable level, but not rise to the level of immediate termination, the employee's supervisor shall promptly notify the employee of such problem, and if practicable, assist the employee to improve himself. The supervisor may allow a reasonable period of time for such improvement, if practicable. The supervisor will also document the notification of unacceptable performance in writing. A copy of such writing shall be filed in the employee's personnel file. 
(2)  Written reprimand. Written warnings and reprimands will be used for repeated misconduct of a minor nature or for more serious misconduct which does not warrant suspension, demotion or termination. A written reprimand is considered more serious than an oral reprimand, but less serious than suspension, demotion or termination. A copy of an employee's written reprimand shall be filed in the employee's personnel file. 
(3)  Suspension. An employee may be suspended without pay by a department head for reasons of misconduct, negligence, inefficiency, insubordination, unauthorized absence or any other justifiable reason not prohibited by the Fair Labor Standards Act, where lesser action would be inappropriate, or after previous oral or written reprimands. The department head shall notify the human resources director in writing no later than 24 hours after the commencement of the suspension. Department heads may suspend an employee for a maximum of five days without prior approval of the village manager. For suspension periods longer than five days, approval of the village manager shall be obtained prior to notification of an employee. 
(4)  Termination. An employee may be terminated by his department head upon approval for such action by the village manager.

ARTICLE III. - REMOVAL OF SNOW AND ICE 
 
Sec. 70-136. - From dedicated, unaccepted streets. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure the safety of the village streets not yet formally accepted by keeping them substantially clear of unreasonable accumulations of snow and ice. Until final acceptance of a planned unit development or subdivision's streets, this responsibility should properly rest on the developer thereof. 
(b)  Responsibility of developer. The subdivider or developer shall be responsible for keeping reasonably clear of ice and snow all dedicated, unaccepted streets within a subdivision. A snow of over two inches, locally measured, and/or a snow that drifts which may obstruct or impair normal traffic movement, shall be removed within six hours of the accumulation thereof. If such accumulation is not removed within the aforementioned period, the village will effect such removal at cost to the developer. In addition, the developer shall keep the streets substantially clear of ice and snow to the maximum degree possible, weather conditions permitting. Further, to ensure safety of drivers and reduce equipment damage, all developers shall bridge manholes on streets that have only a base course. The material used for bridging shall be comparable to that used for the base. 
(c)  Agreement with village. The developer may fulfill the obligations of this section by entering into an agreement with the village for the removal of snow and ice based upon the cost of such removal to the village. The developer shall hold the village harmless and indemnified for any and all damages to subdivision street improvements resulting from ice and snow removal, and shall repair any such damages prior to acceptance of such street improvements by the village. The developer shall also indemnify the village for any damage to village equipment caused by improper street construction. 
(d)  Bond requirement. All developers with dedicated, unaccepted streets shall post a cash bond in the following amount based upon lineal mileage of dedicated, unaccepted streets: 
Under two miles ..... $ 2,500.00 
Two miles to four miles ..... 5,000.00 
Four miles to seven miles ..... 7,500.00 
Over seven miles ..... 10,000.00 
Such bond must be posted by November 1 of each year and will be returned to the developer upon satisfactory compliance with this section on May 1 of the following year. Under such bond requirement, it is the responsibility of the developer to keep all dedicated, unaccepted streets clear of ice and snow or contract with the village for this service. Either improper maintenance of ice and snow removal or failure to promptly reimburse the village for such costs or pursuant to any such service agreement will result in forfeiture of part or all of the bond. 
(e)  Insurance requirement for contractors or subcontractors clearing streets. Any person performing ice or snow removal work shall maintain, for a period from November 1 through May 1 of any winter season, liability and property damage insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.00 each person, $1,000,000.00 aggregate, which shall cause such person, village and the village's representatives to be named insured against liability and property damages which may arise from ice and snow removal work. Such certificate shall be in form and substance satisfactory to and approved by the village. Workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance must also be provided by the contractor, with a minimum amount of $100,000.00 for employer's liability.

ARTICLE VI. - PUBLIC SIDEWALK POLICY[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 05-285, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Dec. 19, 2005, added provisions that were not specifically amendatory. At the editor's discretion, said provisions have been included herein as Article VI, §§ 70-20170-204. The users attention is also directed to § 70-73. 
 
Sec. 70-201. - Introduction. 
This article is intended to formalize a policy for the installation of public sidewalks in the Village of Westmont, Illinois. 
(1)  Reason for installation. Walking is a basic means of travel for citizens. It is the village's desire to install paved public sidewalks in order to provide a clean and safe path for use by pedestrians. 
(2)  Goal of the policy. It is the village's intention to provide public sidewalks initially on at least one side of all streets in the village and on both sides of all heavily-traveled streets in order to minimize the need for pedestrians to cross over said streets to access a public sidewalk. Ultimately, the village intends to provide public sidewalks on both sides of all streets within the village's boundaries. 
(3)  Sidewalk maintenance. Once installed, the village desires to keep its sidewalks in reasonably safe condition for use by the public. To this end, an Inspection and Repair Program has been established, and this is described in the attached Appendix A. 
(Ord. No. 05-285, § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-2005) 
Note Appendix A, referenced above, is not set out herein but is on file and available for inspection in the village offices.  
Sec. 70-202. - Location. 
(a)  General location. 
(1)  Within the village: Public sidewalks shall be located along both sides of all streets in the village. 
(2)  Within the right-of-way: Public sidewalks are generally installed one-foot from the edge of the right-of-way (ROW). This location may be adjusted with the public works director's approval where existing trees or obstructions interfere with the proposed location. However, in order to provide room for snow storage, whenever possible, no sidewalk should be located less than five feet from the edge of the street pavement or back edge of curb and gutter, where it exists. 
(b)  High-priority locations. Wherever there are no existing public sidewalks, priority shall be given to their installation in certain locations where high usage is expected, such as: 
(1)  Schools, parks, and churches: At least one side of the street, within a minimum of 1,200 feet from the property. 
(2)  Business districts: Both sides of streets, to reduce the need for pedestrians to cross. 
(3)  Arterial and collector roads: Both sides of streets, to reduce the need for pedestrians to cross. 
(c)  New development and redevelopment. Village Code requires that public sidewalks be installed along all street rights-of-way where none yet exists. Permits for construction of subdivisions, buildings on individual lots, and additions of 150 square feet or greater shall include the installation of the required sidewalks. In addition, any existing sidewalk that is in need of repair adjacent to said construction shall be required to be replaced as part of the permit. Village staff shall ensure that this requirement is being followed. 
(d)  Special requests. 
(1)  Recommended by staff. Village staff shall maintain a list of locations that have shown a special need for having a sidewalk. 
(2)  Requested by residents. From time to time, the village may receive sidewalk requests from residents. A separate list of these locations shall be maintained for consideration as funding becomes available. In addition to the high priority locations listed above, the village shall give preference to locations that would be an extension to existing sidewalks or complete an entire block. Also, a location will more likely be moved up in priority if the resident or residents offer to pay half or all of the installation costs. 
a.  When a request is received from an owner for a location that is in front of that owner's lot and is adjacent to an existing sidewalk or sidewalks, the village shall immediately add the location to the consideration list. 
b.  When a proposed location is in front of properties with one or more owners. Other than the person making the request, the request must include evidence that at least 51 percent of the owners desire to have the sidewalk installed. Otherwise, the proposed sidewalk shall not be added to the consideration list. 
(Ord. No. 05-285, § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-2005; Ord. No. 06-39, § 1(Exh. A), 3-6-2006; Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007)  
Sec. 70-203. - Scheduling of installation. 
(a)  General. In order to meet the goals described above, the village shall schedule the installation of sidewalks as soon as practicable as needs are identified and as funding permits. 
(b)  Setting priorities. As lists of proposed sidewalk locations are developed, it may be necessary to prioritize the scheduling of the installations. A high priority shall be given to those locations listed above in section 70-202(b). Special request locations shall be considered based on amount of public benefit. 
(c)  Funding. The village shall strive to provide a reasonable amount of funding each year for sidewalk installation in its annual budget. In order to maximize the available funds, the village shall continue its current practice of applying for federal and state grants as they become available. 
(Ord. No. 05-285, § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-2005)  
Sec. 70-204. - ExceptionsAppeals. 
(a)  Requirements for a waiver. It is strongly recommended that village requirements for sidewalks be followed, but if a waiver is desired, only the village board can grant a waiver. 
(b)  Cash in-lieu-of payment. If a waiver is granted, the costs for construction of the sidewalk shall be paid to the village to defray the future costs of installation of that sidewalk. The village shall determine the costs using current prices.

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note Ordinance No. 98-73 which amended ch. 74, art. VI, by adding thereto a new div. 2A, provided as follows in § 5 of such ordinance: This ordinance supersedes all ordinances or parts thereof adopted prior hereto which are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict, including the provisions of division 2 of chapter 74, article VI which are no longer applicable in charging residential users and, eventually, certain other users set forth in section 74-163(E) a five percent gross receipts tax upon the distribution, supplying, furnishing, or selling of electricity for use or consumption within the corporate limits of the village.

This division 2A, in conjunction with various state laws and regulations, accomplishes a phasing out of the gross receipts electricity tax of five percent imposed by section 74-152(2) upon persons engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing or selling electricity for use or consumption within the corporate limits of the village and not for resale. If Public Act 90-561 is declared unconstitutional, or if any portion of this Code added or as amended by Ordinance No. 98-73, which portion affects the amount of tax revenue collected by the village, is voided by court action, the former provisions of the Code of Ordinances, chapter 74, article VI, division 2, shall apply as they applied to persons engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing or selling electricity for use or consumption within the corporate limits of the village and not for resale prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 98-73. In the event of such invalidity, such provisions shall remain in effect in all respects as if they had never been amended or deleted or added to by Ordinance No. 98-73. Any sums and amounts paid to the village by any person delivering electricity pursuant to this division shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to the tax upon gross electricity receipts as it existed under section 74-152(2) prior to the passage of Ordinance No. 98-73.

If a taxpayer under this division is unable to use a credit authorized by this section solely because the tax imposed by division 2 of this article has been replaced by the tax imposed under section 74-163, then the taxpayer may apply such credit against any tax due under section 74-163. 
(Ord. No. 98-73, § 2, 7-20-1998)  
Sec. 74-163. - Tax imposed.

(9)  For the next 10,000,000 kilowatt-hours used or consumed in a month, 0.140 cents per kilowatt-hour; and 
(10)  For the next 20,000,000 kilowatt-hours used or consumed in a month, 0.080 cents per kilowatt-hour.

(a)  Subject to the provisions of section 74-166 regarding the delivery of electricity to resellers, the tax imposed under this division shall be collected from purchasers by the person maintaining a place of business in this state who delivers electricity to such purchasers. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and is recoverable at the same time and in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the electricity. 
(b)  Any tax required to be collected by this division, and any tax in fact collected, shall constitute a debt owed to the village by the person delivering the electricity, provided that the person delivering electricity shall be allowed credit for such tax related to deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as uncollectible, and provided further that, if such charges are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax. 
(c)  Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to three percent of the tax they collect to reimburse them for their expenses incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the village upon request. For purposes of this division, any partial payment of a billed amount not specifically identified by the purchaser shall be deemed to be for the delivery of electricity.

(a)  Every tax collector shall on a monthly basis file a return in a form prescribed by the office of the finance director. The return and accompanying remittance shall be due and payable to the village collector on or before the last day of the month following the month during which the tax is collected or is required to be collected under section 74-163.

(b)  If a person who receives electricity in the village claims to be an authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the office of the finance director for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts showing why it is not liable for the tax imposed by this division on any purchase of electricity and shall furnish such additional information as the office of the finance director may reasonably require. 
(c)  Upon approval of the application, the office of the finance director shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant. 
(d)  The office of the finance director may cancel the resale number of any person if the person fails to pay any tax payable under this division for electricity used or consumed by the person, or if the number was obtained through misrepresentation, or is no longer necessary because the person has discontinued making resales.

(1)  If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this division directly to the village collector pursuant to section 74-165(b) on the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall collect the tax pursuant to section 74-163 and remit the tax pursuant to section 74-165(a) on the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a purchaser. 
(2)  Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active resale number and complying with all other conditions of this section shall be excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the electricity delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the village collector the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller, and such other information that the office of the finance director may reasonably require.

(2)  Upon the completion of an independent audit by the village, the village shall provide to the grantee a final report setting forth the village's findings in detail, including any and all substantiating documentation. In the event of an alleged underpayment, the grantee shall have 30 days from the receipt of the report to provide the village with a written response agreeing to or refuting the results of the audit, including any substantiating documentation. Based on these reports and responses, the parties shall agree upon a "finally settled amount." For purposes of this section, the term "finally settled amount(s)" shall mean the agreed upon underpayment, if any, to the village by the grantee, or overpayment to the village by the grantee as the case may be, as a result of any such audit. If the parties cannot agree on a "final settlement amount," either party may bring an action to have the disputed amount determined by a court of law. 
(3)  Any "finally settled amount(s)" due to the village as a result of such audit shall be paid to the village by the grantee within 30 days from the date the parties agree upon the "finally settled amount." Any overpayment by the grantee to the village shall be credited against subsequent franchise fee payments by the grantee to the village consistent with Section 622(b) of the Cable Act as amended from time to time, until such time as the overpayment is fully credited; or shall be paid by the village to the grantee within 30 days from the date the parties agree upon the "finally settled amount" in the event no subsequent franchise fee payments are due to the village. In the event grantee does not pay the "finally settled amount" within 30 days. Grantee shall be charged and shall pay, in addition to the amount due, interest on the amount due equal to the prevailing prime rate interest compounded from the due date for payment of the "finally settled amount". 
(4)  Once the parties agree upon a "finally settled amount" and such amount is paid by or credited to the grantee, the village shall have no further rights to audit or challenge the payment for that period. The village shall bear the expense of its audit of the grantee's books and records. Grantee shall pay the cost of the audit if the village determines that the annual payment to the village for the preceding year of fees described in subsection 76-35(a) of this agreement with respect to cable service is thereby increased by more than five percent. 
(c)  Address exchange. The village and grantee agree that within 120 days of the effective date and in accordance with applicable privacy laws, they will exchange in electronic form their respective lists of the addresses located within the boundaries of the village in order to ensure that all addresses in the village are included in the grantee's database for the village. The parties agree to exchange said address lists upon written request, but not more than once annually, during the term of this chapter. The village and grantee agree to exercise good faith efforts to maintain the accuracy of their respective databases. Grantee agrees that it shall not use the village's list for any commercial purpose, including marketing and solicitation of new subscribers, but that it may only be used to confirm that franchise fees collected from subscribers are remitted to the correct franchise authority. The address lists shall be exchanged by the parties within 60 days of such request. 
(d)  Proprietary information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement, the grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature. The village agrees to treat any information disclosed by the grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to those employees, representatives, and agents of the village that have a need to know in order to enforce this chapter and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of all such information. For purposes of this section, the terms "proprietary or confidential" include, but are not limited to, information relating to the cable system design, customer lists, marketing plans, financial information unrelated to the calculation of franchise fees or rates pursuant to FCC rules, or other information that is reasonably determined by the grantee to be competitively sensitive. Grantee may make proprietary or confidential information available for inspection but not copying or removal by the village's representative. In the event that the village has in its possession and receives a request under a state "sunshine," public records, or similar law for the disclosure of information that the grantee has designated as confidential, trade secret or proprietary, the village shall notify grantee of such request and cooperate with grantee in opposing such request. Grantee shall indemnify and defend the village from and against any claims arising from the village's opposition to disclosure of any information grantee designates as proprietary or confidential. The village's compliance with an opinion or directive from the Illinois Public Access Counselor or the Illinois Attorney General under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140, or with a decision or order of a court with jurisdiction over the village, shall not be a violation of this section. 
(Ord. No. 10-124, §§ 1(Exh. A §§ 5.15.4), 3, 8-2-2010)  
Sec. 76-36. - Transfer of cable system or franchise or control of grantee. 
Neither the grantee nor any other person may transfer the cable system or the franchise without the prior written consent of the village, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No transfer of control of the grantee, defined as an acquisition of 51 percent or greater ownership interest in grantee, shall take place without the prior written consent of the village, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No consent shall be required, however, for (i) a transfer in trust, by mortgage, hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the grantee in the franchise or in the cable system in order to secure indebtedness, or (ii) a transfer to an entity directly or indirectly owned or controlled by Comcast Corporation. Within 30 days of receiving a request for consent, the village shall, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, notify the grantee in writing of the additional information, if any, it requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee or new controlling party. If the village has not taken final action on the grantee's request for consent within 120 days' after receiving such request, consent shall be deemed granted. 
(Ord. No. 10-124, §§ 1(Exh. A § 6.1), 3, 8-2-2010)  
Sec. 76-37. - Insurance and indemnity. 
(a)  Insurance. Throughout the term of this chapter, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, maintain commercial general liability insurance and provide the village certificates of insurance in accordance with the village's generally applicable right-of-way ordinance. 
(b)  Indemnification. The grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the village, its officers, employees, and agents (the "indemnities") from and against any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit or defense, arising in the course of the grantee's construction, installation, operation, maintenance or removal of the cable system within the village. This duty shall survive for all claims made or actions filed within one year following either the expiration or earlier termination of this agreement or the end of any period of continuing operation after expiration or termination of this agreement. The village shall give the grantee timely written notice of its obligation to indemnify and defend the village after the village's receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this section. For purposes of this section, the word "timely" shall mean within a time period that does not cause any substantial prejudice to the respective positions of the grantee and/or the village. If the village determines that it is necessary for it to employ separate counsel, the costs for such separate counsel shall be the responsibility of the village. 
(1)  The grantee shall not indemnify the village for any liabilities, damages, costs or expense resulting from the misconduct or negligence of the village, its officers, employees and agents for which they may be liable under Illinois law. 
(Ord. No. 10-124, §§ 1(Exh. A §§ 7.1, 7.2), 3, 8-2-2010)  
Sec. 76-38. - System description. 
Technical standards. The grantee shall comply with all applicable technical standards of the FCC as published in 47 C.F.R., Part 76, Subpart K. 
(Ord. No. 10-124, §§ 1(Exh. A § 8.1), 3, 8-2-2010)  
Sec. 76-39. - Enforcement of chapter. 
(a)  Notice of violation or default. In the event the village believes that the grantee has not complied with the material terms of the franchise, it shall notify the grantee in writing with specific details regarding the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance or default. 
(b)  Grantee's right to cure or respond. The grantee shall have 45 days from the receipt of the village's written notice: 
(1)  To respond to the village, contesting the assertion of noncompliance or default, which response shall include documentation to support grantee's position; or 
(2)  To cure such default; or 
(3)  In the event that, by nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the 45-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the village of the steps being taken and the projected date that the cure will be completed. 
(c)  Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, and pursuant to the provisions of subsection 76-39(b) herein, in the event the village determines that the grantee is in default of any material provision of the franchise, the village may: 
(1)  Seek specific performance of any provision that reasonably lends itself to such remedy as an alternative to damages, or seek other relief available at law, including money damages, declaratory or injunctive relief; or 
(2)  In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the franchise, declare the chapter to be revoked. 
a.  The following procedures shall be utilized to revoke the franchise: 
1.  The village shall give written notice to the grantee of its intent to revoke the franchise. The notice shall set forth with specificity the exact nature of the noncompliance. The grantee shall have 30 days from the receipt of such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the village has not received a response from the grantee or upon receipt of the response does not agree with the grantee's proposed remedy, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public hearing. The village shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least ten days prior to such public hearing, a written notice specifying the time and place of such hearing and stating its intent to request termination of the franchise. 
2.  At the designated hearing, the village shall give the grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, present evidence and question witnesses, after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be terminated. The strict rules of evidence shall not apply to said hearing. The public hearing shall be on the record and a written transcript shall be made available to grantee within ten business days. The decision of the village shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the grantee by certified mail. The grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the village "de novo" and to modify, reverse or uphold such decision as justice may require. Any such appeal by grantee shall be made within 90 days of its receipt of the written decision of the village, or forever barred. 
b.  The following events, acts or omissions on the part of grantee are a substantial breach and may be considered cause for revocation of the franchise and termination of this agreement: 
1.  Repeated failure to cure material violations of the chapter after notice from the village, as referenced in subsection (b) grantee's right to cure or respond. 
2.  Material fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining the franchise. 
3.  Repeated failure to pay franchise fees or PEG capital fees, with interest if applicable, when and as due the village. 
4.  Failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage. 
5.  Failure to restore franchise boundary-wide service after 72 consecutive hours provided the grantee's failure to restore franchise boundary-wide service is not caused by circumstances or events beyond the grantee's reasonable control. 
6.  The grantee has been adjudged to be bankrupt, has a receiver appointed for it, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or has a significant amount of its property sold under the execution or other legal process of is seized by creditors. 
7.  Transfer of the franchise without village approval as required herein; provided such approval is required. 
8.  The grantee abandons the franchise. Grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned the franchise if it willfully refuses or is unable to operate the cable system as granted by a franchise agreement, when there is no event beyond the grantee's control that prevents the operation of the cable system, and where operation would not endanger the health or safety of the public or property. 
(d)  Technical violation. The village agrees that it is not its intention to subject the grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for so-called "technical" breach(es) or violation(s) of the franchise, which shall include, but not be limited, to the following: 
(1)  In instances or for matters where a violation or a breach of the franchise by the grantee was good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the customers within the franchise area; or 
(2)  Where there existed circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the grantee and which precipitated a violation by the grantee of the franchise, or which were deemed to have prevented the grantee from complying with a term or condition of the franchise. 
(Ord. No. 10-124, §§ 1(Exh. A §§ 9.19.4), 3, 8-2-2010)  
Sec. 76-40. - Access programming. 
(a)  PEG capacity. Grantee shall provide capacity for the village's noncommercial public, educational and governmental ("PEG") programming through grantee's cable service consistent with the requirements set forth herein. As of the effective date of this agreement, the village utilizes two PEG channels. Unless otherwise agreed to by the village and grantee or otherwise permitted by law, use of channel capacity for PEG access and programming shall be provided to village by grantee on the most basic tier of service offered by grantee. 
(b)  Additional access channel. The village may request, and the grantee shall provide, one additional government access channel, so long as the threshold use requirement is satisfied. For the purposes of this agreement, the term "threshold use requirement" means that the government access channel provided for in paragraph (a) herein, must be programmed by the village at least eight hours per day with nonrepetitive, locally-produced video programming, Monday through Saturday, for a minimum of six consecutive months. The village shall provide the grantee with written documentation evidencing that the threshold use requirements are being satisfied. Grantee shall have 120 days to provide the additional government access channel. The additional access channel may be located on the grantee's digital tier of service. 
(c)  The grantee does not relinquish its ownership of or ultimate right of control over a channel by designating it for PEG use. However, the PEG channel is, and shall be, operated by the village, and the village may at any time allocate or reallocate the usage of the PEG channel among and between different noncommercial uses and users. 
(d)  Rules and procedures for use of PEG access channels. The village shall be responsible for establishing and enforcing rules for the noncommercial use of public, educational and governmental access channels and to promote the use and viewership of the channels. 
(e)  Editorial control. Grantee shall not exercise any editorial control over any use of PEG channels, nor shall grantee or its affiliates incur any criminal or civil liability pursuant to the federal, state or local laws of libel, slander, obscenity, incitement, invasions of privacy, false or misleading advertising, or other similar laws for any programs carried on any PEG channel. 
(f)  PEG capital payments for equipment and facilities. At its sole discretion, the village board may designate government access capital projects to be funded by the village. 
(1)  At any time after the effective date of this agreement, the village may make a written request for the grantee to collect payments for public educational, or governmental access facilities pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 542(g)(2)(C) of the Cable Act, provided that such request is for not more than $0.35 per month per customer and includes a detailed plan for the intended utilization of the requested PEG capital funds and the duration of the time over which such payments shall be made (the "Plan and Request"). The grantee may review the plan and request to provide consultation to the village regarding the compatibility of the proposed access facilities with the grantee's cable system, but such review shall not delay implementation and collection of the PEG access external charge by grantee. Grantee is permitted to and, in the event of such request, shall add a PEG access external charge on each direct pay customer's bill for PEG access purposes, provided, however, that grantee shall first give the village and customers no less than 30 days advance written notice of its intent to do so and the amount of such charge per subscriber per month. 
(2)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the village and the grantee, the external charge (the PEG access capital fee), shall be added within 120 days of the request, and remain on each direct pay customer's bill for the period described in the plan and request. 
(3)  The capital payments shall be expended for capital costs associated with PEG access. Consistent with the description of the intended utilization of the PEG capital fee, the village shall be permitted to hold all or a portion of the PEG capital fee from year to year as a designated fund to permit the village to make large capital expenditures, if necessary, provided that if the entire amount is not expended during the term of this agreement, any remaining funds shall be applied to PEG capital requests from the village in subsequent franchise renewals. If the village chooses to borrow from itself or a financial institution revenue for large PEG capital purchases or capital expenditures, the village shall be permitted to make periodic repayments using the PEG capital fee. 
(4)  Said PEG access capital fees shall be collected first and then paid to the village at the same time and in the same manner as franchise fee payments are made. The capital payments shall be expended for PEG facilities and equipment to be utilized to develop PEG programming. The grantee shall terminate the PEG access capital fee and payment upon receipt of a written request by the village board to terminate the said fee. 
(5)  The parties agree that during the term of this agreement the village may make more than one request for PEG capital funds as described in paragraph (1) above; provided thatNotwithstanding that at the time of such request the PEG access capital fee might be less than $0.35 per month per subscriberIn no event shall such a request result in an increase in the amount of the PEG access capital fee; and provided further that no such request may be made following terminations of the PEG access capital fee pursuant to either paragraph (1) or (4) of this section. 
(g)  Future origination points. At such time that the village determines that it wants the capacity to allow subscribers in the village to receive public, educational and/or governmental access programming (video and character generated) which may originate from schools, village facilities and/or other government facilities (other than those having a signal point of origination at the time of the execution of this agreement); or at such time that the village determines that it wants to establish or change a location from which public, educational and/or governmental access programming is originated; or in the event the village wants to upgrade the connection to Comcast from an existing signal point of origination, the village will give Comcast written notice detailing the point of origination and the capability sought by the village. Comcast agrees to submit a cost estimate to implement the village's plan within a reasonable period of time. After an agreement to reimburse Comcast for its expenditure, Comcast will implement any necessary system changes within a reasonable period of time. 
(h)  Grantee use of fallow time. Because the village and grantee agree that a blank or under utilized access channel is not in the public interest, in the event the village does not completely program a channel, grantee may utilize the channel for its own purposes in accordance with the terms of 47 U.S.C. § 532(b)(4). Grantee may program unused time on the channel subject to reclamation from the village upon no less than 60 days notice. The programming of the access channel with text messaging or playback of previously aired programming shall not constitute fallow time. Text messaging containing out of date or expired information for a period of 30 days shall be considered fallow time. A programming schedule that contains playback of previously aired programming that has not been updated for a period of 90 days shall be considered fallow time. Fallow time shall be considered to be a period of time, in excess of six hours, where no community produced programming of any kind can be viewed on an access channel. Fallow time shall not include periods of time where programming cannot be viewed that are caused by technical difficulties, transition of broadcast media, signal testing, replacement or repair of equipment, or installation or relocation of facilities. 
(Ord. No. 10-124, §§ 1(Exh. A §§ 10.110.8), 3, 8-2-2010)  
Sec. 76-41. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Force majeure. The grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including termination, cancellation or revocation of the franchise), where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature, labor disputes, failure of utility service necessary to operate the cable system, governmental, administrative or judicial order or regulation or other event that is reasonably beyond the grantee's ability to anticipate or control. This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which the grantee's cable or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of materials or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. 
(b)  Notice. Any notification that requires a response or action from a party to this franchise, within a specific time-frame, or trigger a timeline that would affect one or both parties' rights under this franchise, shall be made in writing and shall be sufficiently given and served upon the other party by hand delivery; first class mailRegistered or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or by reputable overnight courier service and addressed as follows:

(f)  No third-party beneficiaries. Nothing in this Chapter is intended to confer third-party beneficiary status on any person, individual, corporation or member of the public to enforce the terms of this chapter.

(h)  Multiple right-of-way regulation. The parties agree, by their acceptance of this franchise, to accept the validity of the terms and conditions of this chapter, and the construction of utility facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way Ordinance in their entirety, and that the parties shall not, at any time, challenge any provision, term, or condition of this chapter or the construction of utility facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way Ordinance, as unreasonable, arbitrary, or void, or that the parties had no power or authority to make such provision, term, or condition as part of, or pursuant to this chapter, or the construction of utility facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way Ordinance, except as to those matters preempted by federal or state law. 
(i)  Amendment of state statutes. This chapter shall not preclude grantee from challenging the validity of the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-100 et seq.) or the Cable and Video Customer Protection Law (220 ILCS 5/22-501 et seq.). 
(j)  Successors and assigns. The village and the grantee agree to be bound by, and to timely and fully perform and fulfill all of the terms, conditions, and representations of this chapter. All provisions of this chapter shall be binding upon the parties and their successors, lessees, delegees, or assignees, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. 
(k)  Entire agreement. This chapter embodies the entire understanding and agreement of the village and the grantee with respect to the subject matter of this agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, ordinances, understandings, negotiations and communications, whether written or oral, and there are no representations or agreements among the parties except as specifically set forth in this agreement. The village may adopt a cable television/video service provider regulatory ordinance that complies with applicable law, provided the provisions of any such ordinance adopted subsequent to the effective date of this chapter shall not apply to the grantee during the term of this chapter.

Such sum shall be paid to the village within 21 days after the date of issuance of an invoice for such sum.

ARTICLE IV. - TRAFFIC SIGNS, SIGNALS AND MARKINGS 
 
Sec. 78-121. - Traffic control signal legend. 
(a)  Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  Green indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, as provided in section 78-124, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Steady yellow indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 78-124, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication. 
a.  Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)c of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown. 
b.  Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)c of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown. 
c.  Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the village board by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subsection (a)(3)a or (a)(3)b of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction or roadways. Such driver shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk. 
d.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 78-124, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(b)  If an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the absence of such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

Sec. 78-122. - Flashing signals. 
(a)  Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in conjunction with a traffic control device it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows: 
(1)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution. 
(b)  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by section 78-222.

(2)  Red X symbol. A driver facing this indication shall not drive in the lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present. Otherwise he shall obey all other traffic controls and follow normal safe driving practices. 
(3)  Yellow X (steady). A driver facing this indication should prepare to vacate the lane over which the signal is located, in a safe manner, to avoid, if possible, occupying that lane when a steady red X is displayed. 
(4)  Flashing yellow arrow. A driver facing this indication may use the lane only for the purpose of approaching and making a left turn.

(d)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  A one-way or single trip movement means one move from the point of origin to the point of destination. Any additional stops between the point of origin and the point of destination are expressly prohibited. 
(2)  Round trip movements means two trips over the same route in opposite direction. 
(3)  Continuous moves are movements generally to one site over a period of 90 days. Continuous move permits may be issued for a period not to exceed 90 calendar days. 
(e)  The chief of police or his or her designee is authorized to approve the application for routes. Upon approval and payment of all required fees, the chief of police or his or her designee shall issue a permit allowing passage of the oversize and/or overweight vehicles over village streets. The permit shall be specific and contain: 
(1)  Permit number. 
(2)  The dates the permit is valid. 
(3)  Whether the permit is single, round or continuous routing. 
(4)  The description of object or vehicle to be moved. 
(5)  Authorized gross weight, axle weight, width, length and height. 
(6)  The authorized routing over village streets including the origin and termination point within the village. 
(7)  The fee paid. 
(8)  The date and signature of the chief of police or his or her designee. 
(9)  In addition, the permit will specify general conditions that the permittee must comply with that are consistent and reasonable for the protection of the general public and village streets. A copy of all permits will be maintained by the police department for information and compliance. 
(f)  It is the duty of the permittee to read and familiarize himself or herself with the permit provisions upon receipt. Undertaking of the permit move is deemed prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit and that:

(2)  All dimension and weight limitations specified in the permit shall not be exceeded; 
(3)  All operation, registration and license requirements have been complied with; 
(4)  All financial responsibilities, obligations and other legal requirements have been met; and 
(5)  The permittee assumes all responsibility for injury or damage to persons or to public or private property, including his or her own, or to the object being transported, caused directly or indirectly by the transportation or movement of vehicles and objects authorized under the permit. He or she agrees to hold the village harmless from all suits, claims, damages, or proceedings of any kind and to indemnify the village for any claim it may be required to pay arising from the movement. 
(g)  The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between permittee and the village that the move described in the application will take place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the village any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the village or the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms. 
(h)  The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of the authority granted by the permit for the use of village roads, and any vehicle and or load found to be off route will be considered off route and without a permit. Permits shall be carried in the vehicle to which the permit applies at all times unless otherwise directed by the chief of police or his or her designee and present upon demand to any and all police officers for the purposes of inspection. 
If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the proper utilities notified, properly moved, bridges or highways analysis performed and completed in advance of any permit movement. All movements under the permit shall be made in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
(i)  The permits issued under this section constitute the grant of a privilege by the village and may be denied, suspended or revoked for such reasons as the village may deem rationally related to its governmental interests including but not limited to: 
(1)  A permittee's knowingly providing incorrect information on an application for a permit; 
(2)  A permittee, its agents or employees acting on a permit which has been altered; 
(3)  Non-compliance by permittee, its agents or employees with federal, state or local laws pertaining to the transport of goods or operation of a vehicle engaged in the transportation of goods;

(j)  A drawn down account, or escrow account, can be established by the permit applicant for the purposes of depositing money for use, as needed, to be automatically withdrawn upon request of the applicant for payment of permit fees. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to maintain a current balance in their drawn down account to cover any and all fees for permit requests. 
(k)  Whenever any vehicle is operating or has operated in violation of the provisions of a village permit, whether it be by size, weight or general provisions, either or both the owner or driver of such vehicle shall be deemed guilty, and both the owner or the driver of such vehicle may be prosecuted for such violation. Any operator/owner of a vehicle in violation of this ordinance will be required to conform their vehicle to the applicable weight, height, width and length restrictions and to post bond in accordance with the Illinois Vehicle Code.

(c)  Seizure and impoundment. 
(1)  Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer may provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility approved by the chief of police. This section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered. 
(2)  The police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle owner's right to request an administrative hearing to be conducted under this section. 
(d)  Administrative hearing. Within ten days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the village shall notify by personal service or by first class mail the owner of record, lessee, and any lienholder of the date, time and location of the administrative hearing. The hearing date shall be scheduled no later than 45 days after the date of the mailing of the notice of hearing. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in violation of this section, then the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for the administrative penalty of $500.00. If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in such a violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and for the return of the vehicle. If the owner of record requests a hearing but fails to appear at the hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village in the amount of the administrative penalty. However, if the owner of record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default order need be entered if the owner is informed of his or her right to a hearing and signs a written waiver, in which case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made when the Village receives the written waiver. 
(e)  Disposition of impounded vehicle. A penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall constitute a debt due and owing the village. A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall remain impounded until: 
(1)  The penalty of $500.00 is paid to the village and all applicable towing fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case the owner of record shall be given possession of the vehicle, or 
(2)  A bond in the amount of $500.00 is posted with the police department and all applicable towing fees are paid to the towing agent, at which time the vehicle will be released to the owner of record, or 
(3)  The vehicle is deemed abandoned 35 [days] after the administrative hearing officer issues a written decision, in which case the vehicle shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles. 
(f)  Posting of bond. If a bond in the amount of $500.00 is posted with the police department, the impounded vehicle shall be released to the owner of record; the owner of the vehicle shall still be liable to the towing agent for any applicable towing fees. If a $500.00 penalty is imposed for violation of this section, the $500.00 bond will be forfeited to the village; however if a violation of this section is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the $500.00 bond will be returned to the person posting the bond. If a $500.00 bond is posted and either a hearing is requested in writing as required in section (d), herein, but the owner fails to appear at the hearing and there is a finding of liability imposed by the hearing officer or if a written waiver of hearing is signed by the owner, the $500.00 will be forfeited to the village. All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the village until the hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until the court issues its decision. Posting of bond may occur at the Westmont Police Department 24-hours a day, any day. 
(g)  Vehicle possession. Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 30 days after the expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial review of the village's action under this section, or the time at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the village, or the time a final administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law, provided, however, that where proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the subject vehicle may not be disposed of by the village except as consistent with those proceedings.

ARTICLE I. - VILLAGE TREES 
 
Sec. 80-1. - Purpose. 
Statement of purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to preserve, protect, replace and properly maintain trees within the village and protect the public from trees which pose a threat or danger because trees: 
(1)  Are an important public resource. 
(2)  Preserve and enhance the village's physical and aesthetic environment, especially its natural and unique atmosphere. 
(3)  Enhance the air quality by filtering air pollutants. 
(4)  Reduce topsoil erosion by the holding effect of their roots. 
(5)  Reduce storm water runoff and replenish ground water supplies. 
(6)  Provide a buffer and screen against noise pollution. 
(7)  Reduce energy consumption by acting as a wind break and producing shade. 
(8)  Preserve and enhance nesting areas for birds and other wildlife which, in turn, assist in the control of insects. 
(9)  Protect and enhance property values. 
(10)  Protect and enhance the quality of life and the general welfare of the village. 
Heritage tree purpose : In addition to the benefits provided by the urban forest, the village recognizes the unique value and importance of heritage trees (as defined herein) due to size, age, species, and/or historic significance, and the village desires to preserve and protect such heritage trees as set forth in this chapter in order to protect and promote the health and welfare of the village. 
The purpose of the heritage tree preservation requirements is to encourage the maximum preservation of heritage trees to achieve a greater overall high tree canopy in order to preserve the scenic beauty of the village, maintain property values, prevent erosion of topsoil, maintain the climatic balance and decrease wind velocities.

[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
Caliper: Thickness of a young/small tree measured six inches from the ground on trees less than four inches in caliper. On trees above four inches in caliper measured at six inch height, move to 12 inches above the ground to measure trunk caliper. 
Construction: Any proposed change in the use or character of land, including but not limited to the replacement of any structure or site improvements. When appropriate to the context, construction may refer to the receipt or necessity of any building, or site work permit. 
Corner visibility triangle: A triangular space determined by measuring 55 feet along each of the streets at a street corner from the point of tangency and connecting the end points. (See Illustration CVT in section 80-16) This space is to be kept free of obstructions so traffic visibility is not obscured. 
Critical root zone : The area of earth surrounding any tree, that is integral to that trees sustainability, viability and survival. For the purposes of this article, critical root zone shall be calculated at 1.25 feet for every inch of the tree's diameter at breast height (DBH). This area is circular around the trunk of a tree. It shall be determined by the measurement of the tree's DBH, then measuring outwards from the trunk 1.25 feet for every inch of trunk diameter, the resulting circular area around the entire tree is the critical root zone. For example, a 20-inch diameter tree would require a 30-foot area of protection around the tree for the critical root zone. This is a minimum area of protection, but a larger area is preferred. A minimum of six feet must be protected around trees regardless of diameter. 
Damage: Damage to a heritage tree shall mean the removal of bark greater than three inches across, the breaking or splitting of the main trunk, the dislocation of the main trunk, adverse impact to the root system, including, but not limited to soil compaction, or any act compromising its health or structural integrity according to accepted industry standards or any impact that is severely detrimental to its overall aesthetics. 
Diameter at breast height (DBH): The diameter of the trunk of the tree measured in inches at a point four and a half feet above ground line. This point of measurement is used for established and mature trees and is referred to as DBH. All references to diameter size shall be to the DBH. 
Drip line: An imaginary, perpendicular line that extends downward from the outermost tips of the tree branches to the ground. 
Hardiness: Ability of a plant to survive low temperatures. 
Heritage tree : Heritage trees are defined as those tree species identified by the village as having significant importance to the village at their respective size class (DBH). They can be identified by species and size in the heritage tree chart found in article III of this chapter. In addition, any tree at or above 35 inches DBH is considered a heritage tree, with the exception of Ulmus pumila. 
Insect pests: Insects, crustaceans, arachnids and vermis injurious to plants, plant products, animals and man. 
Lion tailing: An improper pruning technique in which all branches are removed from the inside ¾ of a limb but left on the end ¼ to form a limb resembling a lion's tail. 
Mature height: Projected height range a particular tree species will grow at its highest point throughout its lifespan. 
Median: The center strip of a boulevard or street on which trees, shrubs or other plant material are planted. 
Mulch: Organic material (such as decaying leaves, bark, or compost) placed over the soil surface for the benefit of plant health. 
Mulch bed: The ground area of a minimum of six feet around the trunk of a tree (three feet off of the trunk of the tree in all directions), covered in mulch. This mulch shall be no more than four inches in depth, and shall not be in contact with the trunk of the tree itself (see Volcano Mulching).

Sec. 80-9. - Parkway tree planting required at new construction. 
Any application for any building permit for any residential construction in excess of 1,000 square feet of new structure, and any new business or institutional construction, and any additional construction at any business or institutional structure increasing the bulk thereof shall be required to install a parkway tree of approved species for each 35 linear feet of parkway or for every 25 feet of parkway with overhead utilities, or be subject to a fee for planting of parkway trees. The amount of the fee shall be the village's actual cost of acquiring and planting one tree for each 35 linear feet of parkway or for every 25 feet of parkway with overhead utilities at the subject property unless the village forester shall determine in accordance with generally accepted forestry standards that the subject property cannot accommodate such trees. If there are existing parkway trees which are properly protected, as indicated in the tree preservation plan, then neither tree installation, nor a fee will be required. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-10. - Parkway tree removal due to constructionReplacement required. 
All parkway trees in construction zones will be properly protected prior to demolition and saved unless otherwise authorized by the village. Removal will require written approval from the village. If the parkway tree or its root system is damaged or injured by other than natural causes to the extent that it is likely to die or become diseased, or if it continues a hazard to persons or property, the village forester may require removal. Parkway trees that are removed will be replaced on a DBH for DBH basis. Trees that are four inches DBH and smaller may be replaced at the associated cost of replacing a tree of the same DBH. Trees that are greater than four inches DBH may be replaced at the associated cost of replacing a number of trees who's DBH is equal to or greater than that of the DBH of the tree removed. No single replacement tree will have a DBH greater than four inches DBH or less than two and a half inches DBH. [Example: A removed tree of ten inches DBH can be replaced by four two and a half inch trees, or by two four inch trees and one two and a half inch tree.] If the parkway of said property cannot accommodate the replacement trees, then the village may require payment as determined by the village, equal to the cost that would have been incurred, in order to purchase and install replacement trees on the parkway elsewhere. The village shall then use such funds to purchase and plant trees on the parkway elsewhere within the village.

(a)  [Public nuisances.] The following are hereby declared public nuisances under this article: 
(1)  Any dead tree, or near dead tree as determined by the village forester, whether located on village-owned property or on private property; 
(2)  Any tree located on village-owned property or on private property which harbors insect pests or plant diseases which reasonably may be expected to spread from tree to tree causing injury or harm to any other tree. Infectious disease includes, but is not limited to, Dutch Elm Disease, Elm Yellows, Oak Wilt, or Pine Wilt; 
(3)  Any tree or portion thereof, whether located on village-owned property or private property which by reason of location or condition constitutes an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public; 
(4)  Any tree or portion thereof whether located on village-owned property or on private property which obstructs the free passage of pedestrians or vehicular traffic, or which obstructs a street light or traffic control device; 
(5)  Any tree or portion thereof whether located on village-owned property or on private property which dangerously obstructs the view in the "corner visibility triangle" as determined by the village. 
(b)  Removal of nuisance trees and limbs. Any owner or occupant of any real property shall remove any dead or dying trees or dead or dying limbs dangerous to life, limb or property located upon the premises of such owner of property within 14 days whenever required to do so by notice from the village served upon the owner or occupant of such property. 
(c)  Allowing nuisance trees to remain prohibited; duty of owner to cut trees. It shall be unlawful for any person owning or controlling any lot, trace or parcel of land to knowingly permit any and all trees, infected with infectious disease, insect pests or vectors that transmit infectious disease, to remain on such property. It shall be the duty of such persons to see that all such trees are properly cut down and removed from the property. The failure to remove and destroy such trees to below ground level shall constitute a violation of this section, and shall be punishable by fine or penalty in addition to such costs as may be incurred by the village in enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Inspection for nuisance trees. In the event the Village of Westmont has reasonable cause to believe, either by virtue of its appearance or otherwise, that any tree located within the village is or might be infected with an infectious disease or is or might harbor vectors that transmit infectious disease, the Village of Westmont is hereby authorized and directed to enter on and upon any private or public property whereon such tree may be located for the purpose of inspecting such suspected tree, marking or identifying the tree, and removing therefrom samples or portions thereof so that same may be tested to establish whether or not such tree is in fact diseased. 
(e)  Notice to remove nuisance trees. When any infectious live or dead tree is discovered by the village, the village will give a written notice, which may be served personally or sent by certified mail, to the person to whom was sent the tax bill for general taxes for the last preceding year on the property. Such notice shall identify the property, by common description, the tree or trees affected, and the substance of section 80-13 and the statutory provisions under which they are adopted. 
(f)  Removal of nuisance trees by village; costs of removal to be lien. In the event that any such infectious live or dead diseased tree is not removed within 14 days from the date of the discovery or sending of such notice, then the Village of Westmont shall post a notice on the front door or entrance to the property where the tree is located notifying the owner or occupant of the village's intention to enter upon such property to cut down and remove the tree and invoice the property owner for the cost thereof. No sooner than seven days after posting such notice, the Village of Westmont may enter upon such property and cut down and remove such tree and invoice the property owner(s) for the cost thereof. Within 120 days after such cost is incurred, the village shall cause to be filed a notice of lien in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of DuPage County. Such notice shall include the following information: (a) a description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof; (b) the amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred or payable for the removal, including any administrative costs incurred in causing the removal and in billing the owner for the cost; (c) the date or dates which such cost and expense was incurred. The village shall also provide a statement that the amount owed shall accrue interest at ten percent a year for each year the amount remains unpaid. Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner of, or persons interested in, said real estate, after the notice of lien has been filed, the village shall issue a release of such lien, which may be filed of record in said recorders office.

(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-15. - Tree appraisal. 
For the purposes of tree replacement, tree value will be determined on a DBH for DBH basis. Trees that are four inches DBH and smaller may be replaced at the associated cost of replacing a tree of the same DBH. Trees that are greater than four inches DBH may be replaced at the associated cost of replacing a number of trees who's DBH is equal to or greater than that of the DBH of the tree removed or damaged to the point in which removal is warranted. No single replacement tree will have a DBH greater than four inches DBH or less than two and a half inches DBH. [Example: A damaged tree of ten inches DBH can be replaced by four two and a half inch trees, or by two four inch trees and one two and a half inch tree.] 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-16. - Tree maintenance standards. 
A site development permit is required to remove, prune, spray, cut roots, or plant any trees in the parkway. Property owners or tree service businesses hired by the property owner, who want to provide parkway tree maintenance at their own expense, must first obtain a site development permit. All tree work must be done by a licensed, insured tree service business. All tree service businesses must be registered with the building division prior to the start of any work within the village. 
The village shall provide maintenance (mulching, pruning, removal, spraying, staking and trunk wrapping) of parkway trees when and where it deems necessary on village owned property. Prior to any maintenance, the village shall attempt to notify any contiguous property owner, but the village shall not be held liable for failure to give notice. The village reserves the right to do pruning, removing, spraying, or otherwise treating any such trees or other plant growth within village owned property, as may be deemed necessary in the public interest. 
(1)  Planting standards. 
a.  Plant material: 
1.  Trees to be planted under utility lines shall have a minimum three inch caliper or be at least six feet in height. All other trees shall have a minimum DBH of two and a half inches and a maximum DBH of four inches. 
2.  Trees shall be single-stemmed and branched no less than four feet above ground. Ornamental trees with branching less than four feet above the ground may be planted with approval of the village forester. 
3.  Plant material shall be of standard quality, true to type, and in all respects be suitable for planting and survival (i.e. hardiness) in Westmont. All plant material must meet the approval of the village. 
4.  Plants shall have normal, well-developed tops and vigorous root systems. 
5.  Plants shall be free of defects, decay, bark/cambium injuries, insects, and diseases. 
b.  Planting requirements: 
1.  Variances for non-approved street trees: Non-approved street trees may be planted in the parkway after site inspection and approval from the village forester. The criteria for a variance shall be as follows: 
i.  Adequate space is available for future growth of the tree. 
ii.  No utility or traffic hazard is or will be created. 
iii.  Tree selection is in accordance with generally accepted urban forestry practices. 
2.  Spacing between parkway trees shall be at least 25 feet for trees planted under utility lines and 35 feet for all others (as per Village of Westmont Approved Street Tree Species List). Spacing must provide for and conform with the mature height of the species involved. Deciduous hardwood (large) trees shall not be planted closer than 35 feet from one another. Variances may be granted by the village forester. Trees planted or growing which are not in accordance with these specifications may be removed or relocated at the discretion of the village. 
3.  When planting more than a single tree, a variety of different species will be required to be selected for planting. The number of different species required for planting will be as follows: 
24 trees to be planted 	Minimum 2 different tree species required 
59 trees to be planted 	Minimum 3 different tree species required 
1014 trees to be planted 	Minimum 4 different tree species required 
1520 trees to be planted 	Minimum 5 different tree species required 
> 20 trees to be planted 	No single species shall make up more than 20 percent of the total trees planted on plantings of over 20 trees 
 
When planting multiple species along any parkway, individual species shall not be planted together in a cluster, rather, mixed in a planting scheme with the other required species. For example, if a person is required to plant nine trees and they have selected Accolade Elm (AE), Bald Cypress (BC) and Burr Oak (BO) as their three required species, they shall not plant individual species clustered together along the parkway [BC, BC, BC, AE, AE, AE, BO, BO, BO], rather, they shall plant them in a mixed configuration along the parkway [BC, AE, BO, AE, BC, BO, BC, AE, BO]. 
4.  For detached sidewalk rights-of-way less than eight feet, the tree shall be planted in the center midway between the curb and sidewalk. For detached sidewalk rights-of-way greater than eight feet, the tree may be planted offset from the centerline with approval from the village. 
5.  No tree with a mature height of greater than 20 feet shall be planted underneath overhead utility lines. Tree species planted or growing underneath overhead utility lines that have a mature height of greater than 20 feet may be removed or relocated at the discretion of the village. 
6.  In order to avoid corner visibility obstructions, no trees shall be planted closer than 30 feet from the point of tangency of the curbs. On corner lots, no plantings, except trees noted herein, may exceed 24 inches at mature height above the curb within the corner visibility triangle. The corner visibility triangle is determined by measuring 55 feet along each of the streets from the point of tangency of the curbs. The two points are connected by a diagonal line creating a triangle. The triangular space, or "Corner Visibility Triangle" (see illustration CVT below), must be kept free of obstructions so traffic visibility is not obscured. 
 

Illustration CVT 
7.  No tree shall be planted closer than ten feet to any driveway nor shall it be planted in such a manner that eventual growth cannot be reasonably controlled so as to avert interference with said driveway. 
8.  No tree shall be planted closer than ten feet to any fire hydrant, vault, buffalo box (water service line), traffic and street signs, street lights, utility poles, or any other public improvements. Bushes, shrubs or grasses may not be planted as to block the view of or hide any fire hydrant. 
9.  Parkway plantings (shrubs, flowers, groundcovers, perennials) having a maximum mature height of 24 inches shall be permissible. Plantings shall exhibit a sense of order, as governed by the village, and be properly maintained by the property owner or resident at which they are planted. Rocks, boulders, timber or other hardscape material shall NOT be allowed. The village shall not be responsible for the replacement of any parkway plantings as a result of utility improvements, utility repairs or other similar public service. 
10.  Parkway trees must be planted at least 20 feet from existing trees on private property. 
11.  Parkway trees shall be planted between six and 12 feet off of the curb line in parkway areas that currently contain no sidewalks. 
c.  Planting methods and techniques: 
1.  Planting pits should be dug no deeper than the depth of the soil ball and be 50 percent wider to aid in tree establishment. 
2.  Plants should be set at one inch above the grade in which they were growing at the nursery, unless, irrigation and drainage issues require planting higher to insure drainage away from the crown of the plant. 
3.  Underground electric, telephone, and cable vision lines, as well as gas lines, water lines, irrigation lines, or other improvements, public or private, shall be located prior to planting. 
4.  Plantings should be mulched to a depth of four inches, and approximately two and a half feet around the base of the tree to cover the root system, but shall not come in contact with the tree trunk itself. 
5.  Watering wells four inches high shall be constructed for plantings in non-irrigated areas to facilitate watering. 
6.  A four-by-four foot square (16 square feet) shall be the minimum planting area for trees surrounded by "hard surfacing". In hard surfaced spaces, the larger the opening for planting space, the better. 
(2)  Tree pruning standards. 
a.  Requirements: 
1.  The village shall maintain street tree clearances of eight to ten feet over sidewalks and at least 15 feet over road surfaces for trees whose branches may obstruct access for pedestrians and vehicles respectively. 
2.  No tree on village owned property shall be topped, tipped, or ornamentally shaped. 
3.  No tree shall be cut back in such a manner that its health or eventual structure will be impaired (i.e. Lion Tailing), except in the process of tree removal or emergency relief of an immediate danger to persons or property. Any such emergency procedures must be reported within one week to the village forester. No more than 30 percent of the live wood may be removed during any pruning. 
4.  When tree-pruning cuts are made to a side limb, the remaining limb should possess a basal diameter of at least one-third of the diameter of the pruning cut. Such cuts shall be considered proper only when the remaining limb is vigorous enough to sustain growth and cover the pruning cut in a reasonable amount of time. 
5.  All final tree pruning cuts shall be made just outside the branch collar as to favor the earliest possible covering of the pruning cut. Flush cuts shall not be made. Stubs shall not be left. The branch collar shall not be damaged in any way. 
6.  Tree limbs shall be removed in a controlled manner as to cause no damage to other parts of the tree, or to other plants, property, or persons. 
7.  All tools used on a tree known to contain an infectious tree disease shall be properly disinfected immediately before and after completing the work on said tree. 
8.  Whenever pruning cuts are to be made while removing limbs too large to hold securely in one hand during the cutting operation, the limbs shall be undercut and removed before making the final cut. 
9.  Any cutting of tree roots, other than when in the process of tree removal, shall give due consideration to the future welfare and safety of the tree. Guidelines for auguring around parkway trees are contained in the Village of Westmont Standard Specifications, January 2003, and as they may, from time to time, be amended. 
10.  Wound dressings shall not be used on pruning cuts or wounds. 
b.  Pruning Best Management Practices: 
Pruning techniques: All tree work shall be in accordance with latest edition of the ANSI A300 Pruning Standard and ANSI Z 133.1 Safety Standard and Best Management Practices - Tree Pruning publication by Ed Gilman and Sharon Lily, Copyright 2002 by International Society of Arboriculture. 
(3)  Tree preservation standards. 
a.  General requirements: 
1.  The entire parkway, except the access point, must be properly fenced off from sidewalk to curb. All fencing must remain in place during the entire construction period. All fencing shall be snow fence of four feet in height and must be secured to metal posts driven into the ground and spaced no further than ten feet apart. 
2.  Protective fencing is required for protection of any tree to be preserved in place within 15 feet of any construction or construction material or construction equipment storage, including trees on adjacent properties. 
3.  Any person performing excavations or trenching within 15 feet of a parkway tree must contact the village 48 hours prior to beginning excavation for approval of tree preservation procedures. 
4.  A site development permit must be obtained prior to any cutting of roots closer than 15 feet of any tree which is to be preserved on any site. 
5.  Auguring under the root systems of public trees or other remedies may be required. Guidelines for auguring around parkway trees are contained in the Village of Westmont Standard Specifications, January 2003, and as they may, from time to time, be amended. 
b.  Tree preservation specifications: 
1.  Village of Westmont Tree Preservation Guidelines are contained in the Village of Westmont Standard Specifications, January 2006, and as they may, from time to time, be amended. 
2.  Guidelines for auguring around parkway trees are contained in the Village of Westmont Standard Specifications, January 2003, and as they may, from time to time, be amended. 
3.  Landscape and site plans should reflect all existing trees to be saved and to be removed. Desirable trees should be protected from construction damage. Any person excavating within 15 feet of a public tree must notify the village 48 hours prior to beginning excavation. A site development permit must be obtained prior to any cutting of roots closer than 15 feet of any tree which is to be preserved on any site. 
4.  Flagging or prominent identification should mark trees to be saved. In traffic areas or places where the bark and cambium may be damaged, snow fence and steel posts should demarcate a safe zone around the tree. 
5.  Avoid compaction of soil by heavy equipment in the root zone of trees to be saved. In instances where soil compaction in the root zone cannot be avoided, vertical mulching and or deep root aeration may be required by the village. 
6.  Curb cuts should not be closer than five feet from the base of the tree. 
7.  Avoid cutting surface roots wherever possible. 
8.  When roots are cut, a smooth, clean cut should be made. Backfill and water immediately to reduce drying of the roots. 
9.  Where grade changes are required, the same area must be provided either by construction of a dry well where the level is to be raised or by building a retaining wall where the level is to be lowered. 
10.  The use of soil sterilants within the root zone of trees or in areas where leaching of soil sterilants into the root zone of trees may occur, is prohibited. 
(4)  Private property requirements. 
a.  Trees and shrubs on private property must be maintained so that no branch overhangs any public right-of-way. Additionally, trees on private property must be kept pruned so they do not obstruct illumination of any streetlights or view of traffic signals or signs 
b.  In the corner visibility triangle, no vegetation, except trees branched high enough to permit visibility of traffic, shall exceed 30 inches above the curb at mature height. The corner visibility triangle is formed by measuring 55 feet along each of the streets from the point of tangency of the curbs. (See illustration CVT in section 80-16) 
c.  The village reserves the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the safe use of the street or sidewalk or when it interferes with the visibility of any traffic control device or sign in accordance with ANSI A300 Pruning Standards. Prior to any pruning, the village shall attempt to notify the contiguous property owner or designee to correct the interference, but shall not be held liable for failure to give notice.

ARTICLE II. - LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS 
 
Sec. 80-41. - Landscape plan application procedure. 
All subdivision, planned unit developments, commercial developments or projects exceeding 5,000 square feet of disturbance shall include the following materials in a form acceptable to the village and as further described herein. The village shall review the application which may include an inspection of the site and referral of the application for recommendation to other appropriate administrative departments or agencies. 
(1)  Tree survey. The tree survey shall include information on all existing trees four inches DBH or larger. Information shall include the location, size, species and condition of each tree, as well as existing and proposed structures, improvements, utilities, driveways, existing and proposed contours at one foot intervals. 
(2)  Tree preservation plan. The tree preservation plan shall identify those trees to be protected with a tree protection detail labeled on the survey. Village of Westmont Tree Preservation Guidelines are contained in the Village of Westmont Standard Specifications, January 2006, and as they may, from time to time, be amended. Information shall include the location, size, species and condition of each tree, as well as proposed structures, improvements, utilities, driveways, proposed contours at one foot intervals and any protective measures to be taken to avoid construction damage to protected trees (i.e. pumping concrete, crown or root pruning). 
(3)  Landscape plan. The applicant shall provide the village with a site plan overlaying the locations of existing trees to be preserved, utilities and utility easements, building pads, retention/detention basins, proposed contours and all proposed landscaping. All landscaping plans shall be prepared by a professional landscape architect or landscape designer in accordance with the Village of Westmont requirements. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-42. - Permit issuance. 
A site development permit shall be required to be obtained: 
(1)  Whenever a person desires to plant, prune, remove, spray or otherwise disturb any tree, shrub or flower on village owned property, 
(2)  Prior to the cutting of any roots within 15 feet of any tree which is to be preserved on any site, 
(3)  Whenever a person desires a species variance for a parkway tree planting issue. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-43. - Tree preservation. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, injure, or undertake any procedure which will cause death or substantial damage to any tree protected by this article. 
(b)  All trees within construction areas or areas where future construction is expected shall be protected until otherwise stated upon approval of a submitted tree survey, tree preservation plan and landscape plan. 
(c)  Fifty percent of existing trees of greater than four inch diameter, as shown on the required tree survey, will be required to be replaced within all construction areas. If the property cannot accommodate the replacement tree or trees, then the village may allow payment as approved by the village forester, equal to the cost that would have been incurred, in order to purchase and install the replacement tree or trees elsewhere. The village shall then use such funds to purchase and plant trees elsewhere within the village. 
(d)  It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, injure, or undertake any procedure which will cause death or substantial damage to any tree on construction areas or areas where future construction is expected prior to approval of a submitted tree survey, tree preservation plan and landscape plan. Trees that are removed prior to approval of the tree survey and landscape plan will be valued on a tree for tree basis and will be required to be replaced within the construction area after construction has commenced. If the property cannot accommodate the replacement tree or trees, then the village may require payment as approved by the village forester, equal to the cost that would have been incurred, in order to purchase and install the replacement tree or trees elsewhere. The village shall then use such funds to purchase and plant trees elsewhere within the village. 
(e)  The village shall retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with this section and shall have the right to issue a stop work order for non-compliance. No stop work order issued pursuant to this section shall be removed except by the village. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-44. - Tree protection. 
(a)  In instances where construction or other site work may affect trees and their root zones on a given parcel or on adjacent parcels, all appropriate tree protection measures must be taken. Village of Westmont Tree Preservation Guidelines are contained in the Village of Westmont Standard Specifications, January 2006, and as they may, from time to time, be amended. The applicant must consider and the village may require, the following specific protective measures for all development, or work requiring a permit, on properties with trees subject to regulation. Violation will result in the stoppage of all work and fines each day for each separate violation until corrections have been made to the satisfaction of the village. 
(1)  Protective fencing is required for protection of any tree to be preserved in place within 15 feet of any construction or construction material or construction equipment storage, including trees on adjacent properties, and is to be shown on the tree preservation plan. The entire parkway, except the access point, must be properly fenced off from sidewalk to curb. All required protective fencing must be in place and approved by the village before a demolition permit will be issued. All fencing must remain in place during the entire construction period. All fencing shall be snow fence of four feet in height unless otherwise specified by the village. All fencing must be secured to metal posts driven into the ground and spaced no further than ten feet apart. Fencing shall not be removed or relocated unless authorized in writing by the village. The general contractor shall be responsible for the construction, erection, and maintenance of tree protection fencing in accordance with the conditions of the building permit around tree preservation areas. The approved tree preservation plan shall be available on the building site before work commences and always during construction of the project. The general contractor shall be responsible for giving written notice of the tree preservation plan to all contractors or subcontractors prior to their entering the site. 
(2)  Pumping of concrete for the foundation or other protective measures such as crown pruning and root pruning may be required for preservation of the existing trees. These measures must be indicated on the tree preservation plan. 
(3)  During construction all reasonable steps necessary to prevent the destruction or damaging of trees to be preserved and their root zones shall be taken. No vehicle or equipment shall be driven nor parked within the tree protection zone. 
(4)  During construction, unless otherwise authorized by the approved tree preservation Plan, no excess soil, additional fill, equipment, liquids, or construction debris, shall be placed within the root zone of any tree that is required to be preserved in its present location. 
(5)  No attachments, fences or wires, other than approved materials for bracing, guying or wrapping, shall be attached to any tree which is being preserved during the construction period. 
(6)  All measures shall be taken to maintain the health of trees which are transported to the site. 
(7)  Because construction damage to trees can sometimes take a number of years before becoming apparent, any violation of the tree preservation specifications will deem the tree injured. The contractor will then have the option to remove and replace the tree as specified in this chapter or post a bond for a period of three years for the associated cost of alleviating said construction damage within the three year period (pruning or removal and replacement). Contractors shall retain no responsibility after the construction process is completed for trees which have been properly protected throughout the entire construction process. 
(b)  The village shall retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with this section and shall have the right to issue a stop work order for non-compliance. No stop work order issued pursuant to this section shall be removed except by the village. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-45. - Replacement of removed trees. 
When issuing a site development permit authorizing the removal of a tree, the village may require the property owner to replace the tree or trees so removed in accordance with the following minimum standards. 
(1)  For parkway tree removal please see section 80-10. 
(2)  If removal of a tree, which was to be preserved according to the approved tree preservation plan, off of village owned property was granted for the proposed development or improvement of a property or to alleviate a hardship on the property, it shall be replaced with a new tree of approved species with a minimum DBH of four inches. If the property cannot accommodate the replacement tree or trees, then the village may require payment as approved by the village forester, equal to the cost that would have been incurred, in order to purchase and install replacement trees elsewhere. The village shall then use such funds to purchase and plant trees elsewhere within the village. 
(3)  If a tree, which is to be preserved according to the approved tree preservation plan, is damaged or injured by other than natural causes to the extent that it is likely to die or become diseased, or if it continues a hazard to persons or property, it shall be removed and replaced with a new tree, which shall have a minimum DBH of four inches. If the property cannot accommodate the replacement tree or trees, then the village may require payment as approved by the village forester, equal to the cost that would have been incurred, in order to purchase and install replacement trees elsewhere. The village shall then use such funds to purchase and plant trees elsewhere within the village. 
(4)  The village forester shall approve all species of trees to be planted on the property when planting of replacement trees is required. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-46. - Landscape standards. 
The planting of trees and beautification of the village is essential to the quality of life for Westmont and its residents. Improved landscapes can increase property values, improve air quality, residents will have a more positive view of their surroundings and the 'heat island' effect on the urban environment can be reduced. It is the intent of this chapter to make Westmont more beautiful and a healthier place to live. Landscapes with diversity and seasonal interest are encouraged. 
(1)  Residential, minimum standards for commercial and multi-family construction. 
a.  In front, side or rear yards, a minimum of two shrubs with a minimum height of 24 inches at the time of planting, must be planted for every ten linear feet of foundation along the portion of the building facing a public or private street. 
b.  In addition to the above, two of the following must also be satisfied: 
 One shade tree must be planted on the site for each 100 linear feet of foundation, or portion thereof, along the front and corner side yards. 
 Two under story or ornamental trees must be planted on the site for each 100 linear feet of foundation, or portion thereof, along the front and corner side yards. 
 Two six to eight foot tall evergreens must be planted on the site for each 100 linear feet of foundation, or portion thereof, along the front and side yards. 
c.  Planting beds must be covered with ground cover or mulch. 
d.  Tree planting in private areas should be done in a solar conscious design, emphasizing the benefits of shade during the summer months and warming sunlight in the winter. 
(2)  Ability to waive requirements for residential landscape plan. The village may waive the minimum landscape requirement and the requirement for a landscape plan if the petitioner demonstrates that one or more of the following conditions are satisfied. 
a.  Sufficient mature trees and vegetation exist on the site in a manner that meets the intent of this chapter with plans to properly protect said trees or vegetation and protection measures are carried out properly throughout the entire construction process. 
b.  Installing plant material would compromise the health, vitality, or ecology of the existing vegetation on the site, or on neighboring sites. 
c.  Significant open space or vistas would be negatively impacted by the installation of the required plants. 
(3)  Non-residential, minimum standards for commercial and multi-family construction. 
a.  At least 50 percent of the open space on the site shall be landscaped. 
b.  At least one tree shall be planted for every 500 square feet of the area required to be landscaped. One-third of the trees shall be evergreens of a minimum six feet in height, one-third of the trees shall be ornamental a minimum of three inch caliper or six feet in height, and one-third of the trees shall be shade trees, a minimum of three inch DBH. 
c.  One shrub shall be planted for every 50 square feet of the area required to be landscaped. For shrubs that mature less than five feet in height, minimum installation size shall be two feet tall. For shrubs that mature greater than five feet in height, minimum installation size shall be three feet tall. 
d.  Foundation plantings of a minimum width of six feet shall be provided on all sides of the main structure except where sidewalks, driveways or other hardscape abuts the structure. Foundation plantings shall be comprised of a combination of shade trees, ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubs, ground covers and flowers. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-47. - Parking lots. 
(a)  Parking lot interior. At least one tree of not less than three inches DBH shall be planted for every 1,500 square feet of pavement area between zero and 6,000 square feet. For pavement areas exceeding 6,000 square feet at least one tree of not less than three inches DBH shall be planted each additional 3,000 square feet. Fifty percent of tree placement shall be within the pavement area as opposed to perimeter planting. 
(b)  Parking lot screening. All off-street parking areas containing more than four parking spaces and non-residential driveways adjacent to lot lines shall be suitably screened on each side and rear lot line by a screen fence or wall not less than four feet in height plus a planting strip of four feet minimum width in accordance with the following, or on an alternate arrangement as approved by the village board.

(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-48. - Native/natural areas plantings. 
The Village of Westmont is committed to improving and enhancing the environment and quality of life in Westmont. Native landscaping and the naturalization of detention basins contribute greatly to the improvement of the local environment. The village encourages the implementation of these "Best Management Practices" (BMP's) wherever possible and practical. The benefits include: 
 Filtration and removal of nutrients and other contaminants from stormwater runoff; 
 Reduction of erosion and sedimentation; 
 Reduction of pollution, resulting from less mowing activity; 
 Reduction of long term maintenance costs; 
 Reduction of congregating nuisance waterfowl on sites; 
 Provide habitat for local wildlife; 
 Help meet the goals of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II of the Clean Water Act. 
(1)  The design and installation of "BMP's" shall be performed by a practitioner with at least five years experience in the practice of native landscaping or ecological restoration. 
(2)  Native plants require a longer establishment period than turf grass and therefore, the developer will be required to provide a management and maintenance bond with services for a period of no less than three years. Upon the completion and acceptance of the three year maintenance period, responsibility for long term maintenance will be assumed by the owner of the development or the homeowners association. 
(3)  Long term maintenance will require controlled burns as the primary management tool and be required once every three years. Spot herbicide application may also be employed where burning is not effective in controlling invasive species. All person(s) employed or contracted to perform a controlled burn shall have the proper certification and insurance and be responsible for acquiring the necessary Open Burn Permit through the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA). The Westmont Police and Fire Departments must be notified of the controlled burn two weeks prior to the activity. 
(Ord. No. 07-181, § 1, 12-3-2007)  
Sec. 80-49. - Maintenance. 
(a)  Responsibility. All required landscaping on private property to be maintained throughout the life of the project, obligation assumed by subsequent owners. All required landscaping to be replaced throughout the life of the project, as required, obligation assumed by subsequent owners. 
(b)  Weeds. Refer to chapter 86 of this Code for information regarding the village's rules regarding vegetation/weeds.

Sec. 80-91. - Heritage tree identification. 
Tree preservation plans required by this chapter shall provide the following information regarding heritage trees: 
(1)  Identification of location, diameter and species of all heritage trees on the site. 
(2)  Identification of which heritage trees are (i) to be protected, preserved or undisturbed, (ii) to be removed or disturbed, and (iii) exempt from the calculation. 
(3)  Identification of all heritage trees which are dead, diseased or have been damaged. 
(4)  Areas proposed to be designated as natural preserves where all natural vegetation, including heritage trees, will be protected and preserved. 
(5)  Proposed disturbance zones. 
(6)  Proposed locations and details of tree protection fencing to be installed for all trees to be preserved. No excavation or other activity shall occur within the critical root zone or within the drip line, whichever is greater, of any heritage tree that is to be preserved. 
(Ord. No. 17-157, § 2, 10-26-2017)  
Sec. 80-92. - Heritage tree preservation. 
Heritage trees to be saved shall be evaluated by considering preserving clusters of trees and their understory, species and condition (maintain slower growing trees in good condition), long-term suitability of the tree for its present location, length of time to mitigate losses, cost of mitigating tree losses, and related factors. 
(Ord. No. 17-157, § 2, 10-26-2017)  
Sec. 80-93. - Heritage tree replacements. 
The village finds that larger trees provide larger benefits that promote the purpose of these heritage tree regulations. The village further finds that it will take decades for the planting of young trees to mature in order to replace the value of mature trees and, for this reason, efforts should be made to preserve and protect existing heritage trees where they are growing. 
Should an applicant request the removal of a tree classified as a heritage tree, the tree must be replaced with three inches of replacement caliper for every one inch DBH that is removed. Replacement trees shall be a minimum of two inches caliper and a maximum of three inches caliper at the time of installation (example: a 24 inch heritage tree must be replaced with 36 two inch caliper trees (a total of 72 inches caliper)). All replacement species shall be approved by the village forester prior to planting. 
(1)  If the property cannot accommodate the required replacement trees (as determined by the village forester), then the village may allow payment equal to the cost that would have been incurred to purchase and install replacement trees, so that the village may purchase and install the replacement tree(s) elsewhere within the village. 
(2)  Replacement plantings shall be guaranteed for a period of three years following initial installation. 
(3)  Replacement trees shall be properly cared for a period of three years following installation, including weekly watering (minimum five gallons per tree) and maintaining the tree's mulch bed (avoiding volcano mulching). 
(Ord. No. 17-157, § 2, 10-26-2017)  
Sec. 80-94. - Heritage tree fines; replacement; remediation; bond. 
A property owner or occupant who removes or permits to be removed heritage trees without a permit, or who damages or permits to be damaged heritage trees, shall be subject to a $1000.00 fine per tree removed or damaged, along with double the associated required replacement of total removed diameter (DBH). If there is no way to determine the DBH of the removed tree or trees, the diameter will be determined by measuring the diameter of the remaining stump, along with associated fines/penalties. If no stump remains, the tree diameter will be determined by measuring the diameter of the area which is ground out, or backfilled with soil and valued at double the diameter of said area. Heritage trees that are damaged due to owner's or occupant's conduct to the point that the village forester requires removal will also subject the owner or occupant to the fines and replacement obligations of this section. 
Heritage trees that are damaged due to owner's or occupant's conduct in violation of this article to a point that the village forester does not require removal, but does require remediation measures to ensure the best chance of survival for said tree or trees, will require a cash bond in an amount to cover the potential costs of removal and replacement, and all associated costs of required remediation measures for a three year period. In addition, the owner or occupant shall pay a fine as specified in this section for each damaged tree. The owner or occupant must take all reasonable remediation measures required by the village forester. At the end of this three year bond period, the tree or trees will be reevaluated by the village forester. If removal is then required, the village shall confiscate the bond, except that the village shall return the portion of the bond representing removal and replacement costs once the owner or occupant demonstrates that he or she has removed and replaced the tree(s) in compliance with this article. If further remediation is needed after the initial three year bond period expires, then the village shall continue to hold the bond for another three year bond period and the owner or occupant shall take the necessary additional remediation measures. If no further measures are needed, the remaining bond shall be returned. With the owner's or occupant's consent, the village may utilize the confiscated bond money to enter upon the property and plant replacement trees. 
Each tree cut down, destroyed, damaged, removed or moved shall constitute a separate offense. The remedies provided for in this article are in addition to any other lawful or equitable remedies available to the village. The village may issue a stop work order on any construction due to a violation of this article, and may allow construction to resume once the owner or occupant has complied with the requirements of this article. 
The fines and requirements of this section shall not apply to an emergency situation caused by a hazardous tree that endangers life or property and where removal is authorized by the order of the fire department, police department or village forester. Further, any franchised public utility or representative of the village may remove or prune trees which interfere with the safe and efficient operation of the public service for which they are responsible, but only to the extent made necessary by such interference. 
(Ord. No. 17-157, § 2, 10-26-2017)  
Sec. 80-95. - Heritage tree removal/disturbance in residential districts. 
No owner or occupant developing property shall remove or cause to be removed any heritage tree unless (i) such tree is located within the area of the property on which there is proposed the construction of physical improvements including, but not limited to, the building, deck, accessory buildings or structures, porch, patio, driveway, and any utility/drainage easement ("building area"), and (ii) every effort shall be made to locate the building area so as to avoid damage to or removal of such tree or trees. The burden is on the owner or occupant to provide the village with evidence to establish that it is not feasible to relocate the building area based upon the physical characteristics or condition of the property or that such relocation creates undue hardship and financial expense.

(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

(a)  Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon, the rights-of-way. 
(b)  Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law; 
(2)  If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required; 
(3)  If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this article; or 
(4)  If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise. 
(c)  Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. 
(d)  Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the village determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person. 
(Ord. No. 07-179, § 2, 11-19-2007)  
Sec. 82-369. - Clean-up and restoration. 
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the village. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be extended by the village for good cause shown.

(a)  General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense. 
(b)  Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit: 
(1)  If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the village director of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately. 
(3)  In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public. 
(c)  Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after an emergency repair.

(a)  Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the provisions of this article must do so in writing to the village director of public works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted. 
(b)  Authority to grant variances. The village director of public works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual basis. 
(c)  Conditions for granting of variance. The village director of public works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
(1)  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
(2)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(d)  Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the village director of public works may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village director of public works under the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the village clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal.

There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. 
(Ord. No. 07-179, § 2, 11-19-2007)  
Sec. 82-373. - Enforcement.

ARTICLE IX. - ELECTRICAL AGGREGATION PLAN OF OPERATION AND GOVERNANCE[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 12-90, § 4(Exh. A), adopted May 21, 2012, did not specifically amend the Code; therefore, these provisions have been included as Art. IX, at the editor's discretion. 
 
Sec. 82-401. - History and purpose of municipal aggregation. 
Pursuant to the Illinois Power Agency Act, 20 ILCS 3855/1-92, municipalities such as the Village of Westmont are authorized to aggregate the electric loads of small commercial and retail customers located within the village and to then solicit bids, select a retail electric supplier, and enter into a service agreement to facilitate the purchase of electricity and related services and equipment on behalf of its residents and small businesses. The statute is a part of the state's electric deregulation efforts which allow customers access to competitive retail electric markets. 
In accordance with that law, in 2011, the Village of Westmont Village Board passed a resolution authorizing a referendum on the March 20, 2012 ballot which asked the public for authority to create an opt-out aggregation program for its residents and small business customers. 
Voters approved the Village of Westmont's Electrical Aggregation Referendum on the March 20, 2012 ballot. 
The village also conducted a public outreach campaign to educate Westmont residents and small businesses about the aggregation program and to gather input regarding their preferences for the development of this aggregation plan of operation and governance. Outreach efforts included presentations at a village board meeting, publication on the village website and in social media, and two statutorily required public hearings. 
The Village of Westmont Aggregation Program seeks to aggregate the retail electric loads of eligible residents and small commercial retail accounts and to solicit bids for the purchase of that electricity. Westmont's program will solicit bids for both a lowest rate alternative as well as alternatives for renewable energy certificates (RECs). With an estimate of 11,000 eligible electric accounts, the aggregation program has the potential to attract lower rates than the current default tariff service rate, while also contributing to renewable energy development. 
Residential and small commercial retail customers often lack the knowledge, time and awareness to conduct due diligence and negotiate favorable terms with alternate retail electric suppliers on their own. Westmont's program not only provides these services, but provides the bargaining power achieved through the size of the aggregation program. The aggregation program is designed to reduce the amount its members pay for electric energy power supply and gain other favorable terms of service. 
Westmont will not buy or resell power, but will competitively bid and negotiate a contract with a competent and licensed alternative retail electric supplier (ARES) to provide electric supply at contracted rates to all members of the aggregation program. The ARES shall provide accurate and understandable pricing, ancillary services and an opt-out notification plan. The ARES will also perform and manage ancillary services for the aggregation members as described in this document. 
Pursuant to the opt-out aggregation program, all customers in the defined aggregation group shall participate in the program unless they affirmatively elect to opt out of the program. By including procedures by which customers may opt-out, the aggregation program ensures that participation is voluntary and individuals have the ability to decline to participate. 
As required by law, this plan of operation and governance describes: 
(1)  How the aggregation program will provide for universal access to all applicable residential customers and equitable treatment of applicable residential customers; 
(2)  How any demand management and energy efficiency services will be provided to each class of customers; and 
(3)  How the aggregation will meet any other legal requirements concerning aggregated electric service. 
Westmont and the selected ARES will follow the plan of operation and governance as set forth in this document. 
(Ord. No. 12-90, § 4(Exh. A(I)), 5-21-2012)

The village shall develop an RFP document containing the terms and conditions required in this plan of operation and governance. The RFP process, whether by the village or in concert with other municipalities will be conducted in accordance with all applicable state and local laws and village procurement policies. 
The corporate authorities of the village will retain the full and absolute right to accept, accept with conditions, or reject any proposal. The village may, but is not required to, select an ARES to provide an energy power supply for the aggregation program according to the terms of the service agreement between the village and the ARES. If the village does not accept any proposal, it retains the right to revise and reissue the RFP documents as it deems appropriate. 
The proposers shall fully comply with the terms of the RFP or shall be excluded from consideration. 
(b)  Contents of the RFP. 
(1)  Term of agreement. The initial service agreement shall be for at least a one-year period, with an option to renew for one additional year, provided the ARES can meet or offer a price below the rate to compare. The village shall retain the right [to] cancel the contract and seek additional bids. The village board will have discretion to determine the length of any contract periods.

(Ord. No. 12-90, § 4(Exh. A(VI)), 5-21-2012)  
Sec. 82-407. - Implementation procedures. 
(a)  Development of customer database. Pursuant to ICC regulations, after this plan is approved by the village, the village manager or his designee will then submit a direct access request and Government Authority Aggregation Form to ComEd (ILL.C.C. No. 10 Rate GAP Government Aggregation Protocols, Sheets 406-411, April 17, 2011) requesting that it provide the village with retail customer identification information. ComEd will provide the village with the requested information within ten business days of receiving the request in accordance with those adopted protocols. After selecting and contracting with an ARES, the village, under confidential agreement with the ARES, will work with the ARES, to remove any customers determined to be ineligible. The ARES and the village will complete this eligibility review within five business days. 
The retail customer identification information will remain the property of the Village of Westmont, and the ARES will comply with the confidentiality and non-compete provisions in the service agreement. 
After the retail customer identification information is reviewed, the ARES will mail the opt-out notices described below to all eligible account holders within the boundaries of Westmont. 
The ARES shall treat all customers equally and shall not deny service to any eligible customer in the aggregation program. 
(b)  Maintenance of accurate and secure customer records. The ARES will maintain a secure database of customer account information. The database will include the ComEd account number, and ARES account number of each active Member, and other pertinent information such as rate code, rider code (if applicable), and usage and demand history. The database will be updated on an ongoing basis. 
The ARES will maintain the database in a secure and confidential manner. The ARES will keep customer account information for a minimum of two years following the termination of the service. 
(c)  Opt-out process. The village's aggregation program is an opt-out program pursuant to 20 ILCS 3855/1-92. Any eligible electric account that opts out of the aggregation program pursuant to the procedures stated below will remain on the applicable ComEd default tariff service unless and until the account chooses another ARES or ComEd supply service. 
(1)  Manner of providing notices and information. The ARES will be required to pay for printing and mailing of all aggregation and opt-out notices. The ARES will mail aggregation and opt-out notices to the eligible account holders within the boundaries of Westmont at the address provided with the retail customer identification information provided by ComEd. 
(2)  Content of notice. The village and the ARES will agree to the format and contents of the aggregation and opt-out notice prior to distribution or mailing. The notice will inform the electric account owner of the existence of the aggregation program, the identity of the ARES, the rates to be charged. The notice will also inform PIPP customers of the consequences of participating in the aggregation program. 
The notice will provide a method for customers to opt-out of the aggregation program. The notice shall indicate that it is from the village, and include the village name and logo on the envelope. The notice shall be signed by the village manager or his designee. 
(3)  Time to respond. Aggregation members shall have 21 calendar days from the postmark date on the notice to mail the opt-out card back to the ARES stating their intention to opt-out of the village aggregation program. 
The time to respond shall be calculated based on the post-mark date of the notice to the customer and the post-mark date of the customer's response. The ARES may offer additional means of opting out, such as a toll-free number, website, smart device quick response code, email address or fax number, each of which must be received within 14 days from the post-mark date on the opt-out notice. Upon receipt of the opt-out reply, the ARES will remove the account from the aggregation program. 
After the expiration of the 21-day opt-out period, the customer list shall become final. All customers who have not opted out will be automatically enrolled in the aggregation program. Customers will not need to take any affirmative steps in order to be included in the program. 
In the event that an eligible aggregation member is inadvertently not sent an opt- out notice, or is inadvertently omitted from the aggregation program, the ARES will work with the village and the member to ensure that the member's decision to remain in, or opt out, of the program is properly recorded and implemented by the ARES.

A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the village on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the village makes available under this article for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph. 
(g)  Annual recurring rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (i) $200.00 per year or (ii) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the village utility pole.

The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the village notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment. 
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery. 
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless provider.

(Ord. No. 18-191, § 2, 12-20-2018)  
Sec. 82-455. - Indemnification. 
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the village harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this article and the Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability. 
(Ord. No. 18-191, § 2, 12-20-2018)

The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. 
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the village.

Notes: 
1 Premium for enclosed off-street parking. Where any required off-street parking spaces in the R-5 district are located in an enclosed garage under the dwelling structure or in a garage having more than one level, one-half of the square footage of floor area occupied by such interior off-street parking spaces and access aisles may be added to the square feet contained in the lot, the sum of which shall represent the lot area used for determining the permitted number of dwellings and the maximum floor area ratio. 
2 Any room other than a kitchen, bathroom, living room, dining room or utility room in excess of 80 square feet in area shall be counted as a bedroom. 
3 Each required yard shall be increased by one-half foot for each foot in height that a building exceeds 30 feet in height, and where a side lot line in an R-4 district adjoins a side or rear lot line in an R-1, R-2 or R-3 district, the required interior side yard shall be increased to 15 feet, and where a rear lot line in an R-4 district adjoins a side or rear lot line in an R-1, R-2 or R-3 district, the required rear yard shall be increased to 40 feet, and there shall be provided a six-foot-high solid fence, or six-foot-high dense hedge on the R-4 lot along such common lot line. 
4 Each required yard or transitional yard shall be increased by one-half foot for each foot that a building exceeds 30 feet in height, and, in addition, where an R-5 district adjoins another residence district, transitional yards shall be provided as follows: 
(1)  Where a side or rear yard of a lot in an R-5 district adjoins the side or rear yard of a lot in an R-4 district, each such adjoining yard in the R-4 district shall be increased by ten feet. 
(2)  Where a side or rear yard of a lot in an R-5 district adjoins the side or rear yard of an R-1, R-2 or R-3 single-family residence district, each such adjoining yard shall be increased by 15 feet and there shall be provided a six-foot-high solid fence or six-foot-high dense landscape hedge on the R-5 lot along such common lot line. 
5 For frontages on major arterial streets, refer to section 4.16, article IV. 
6 Minimum lot width in an R-3 district shall be 60 feet; except that a recommendation may be made by the planning and zoning commission to amend to 50 feet, after all responsible effort has been made to maintain the 60-foot width by acquisition of adjoining property and a resubdivision hearing has been held and the board of trustees concur. 
7 Interior side yard for R-3 district setback for accessory structures (i.e., garage, etc.) shall be a minimum of three feet, and shall be located behind the main structure rear wall, per section 4.05(B). 
8 Where under previously enacted zoning regulations for interior side yards, and a setback was established as a minimum at the time of construction; that setback may be maintained when alterations or additions are proposed for the existing structure. 
9 For corner lots subdivided and duly recorded on the effective date of this ordinance which have insufficient lot width to provide the required minimum side yard adjoining a street and still maintain a buildable lot width of 30 feet, the required side yard adjoining the street shall be minimum 25 feet, and the required minimum interior side yard shall be five feet. 
10 When a minimum front yard setback was established at the time of construction under previously enacted zoning regulations, that setback may be maintained without a variance when second story additions are proposed for the existing structure provided that the alteration matches the original building footprint. 
11 When the application of the lot coverage regulations specified herein results in proposed lot coverage between 3540 percent, a permit may be eligible for administrative approval (in lieu of a variance) provided that the property is not identified within any building moratorium area, known drainage problem area, or within any identifiable drainage sub basin area. 
12 In the R-3 district, where the setback of the principal structure on at least one of the adjacent lots on either side of the subject lot is less than 35 feet, the dwelling may encroach into the setback a maximum of ten feet or to match the adjacent property, whichever is less.

ARTICLE VII. - BUSINESS DISTRICTS 
 
Sec. 7.01. - Preamble. 
Business district regulations are intended to govern the location and uses of a full range of business and commercial establishments needed to serve the citizens of Westmont and its trade area. The regulations of the various business districts are designed to provide for groupings of business and commercial establishments that are compatible in scope of services and method of operations. The B-1 district is intended for application in the prime business centers and planned shopping centers characterized mainly by nonautomotive-oriented retail stores and shops. The B-2 district is intended for those portions of the village where highway-oriented retail business establishments are appropriate as well as general business activity. The C-1 district is intended for the South Westmont Business District and is created to encourage retail and sales tax generating commercial uses. All business establishments in the various business districts are intended to be retail trade or service establishments dealing directly with consumers. The production of goods on the premises is intended to be limited to those sold on the premises, or clearly incidental and accessory to the principal retail trade or service. 
(Ord. No. 07-15, § 3, 2-5-2007)  
Sec. 7.02. - Business district provisions. 
(A)  Dwelling units. Dwelling units and lodging rooms are not permitted in the B-1, B-2 and C-1 districts except as follows: 
(1)  In a permitted hotel, motel, convent, monastery, parsonage or rectory. 
(2)  In a special use where residential quarters are required for security and management on the site; these quarters shall be one dwelling unit. 
(3)  In the central business district, dwelling units may be permitted in conjunction with commercial enterprises. 
(4)  Dwelling unit(s) existing upon the date of this amendment shall be allowed to continue as a residence, when located in a business district. 
(5)  In the B-2 district, residential dwelling units may be permitted as part of a planned development where the majority use of the non-residential portion of the principle building is office use. 
(B)  Enclosure of operations. All business, servicing, storage or processing shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings except: 
(1)  Off-street parking or loading; 
(2)  Drive-in type of operations and automatic teller machines (ATMs) when conducted as a special use in the B-1, B-2 or C-1 district; 
(3)  Open sales lots when operated as a permitted or special use in the B-2 district; and 
(4)  Special outdoor sales events of limited duration sponsored by an association of merchants for the promotion of a business district. 
(C)  Performance standards. All activities shall conform with the performance standards established for the M manufacturing district. 
(D)  Parking limitations. Parking of trucks or commercial vehicles in excess of one hour when accessory to the conduct of a permitted use shall be limited to trucks or commercial vehicles having capacity of less than 1½ tons, except for pickup or delivery services during normal business hours. 
(E)  Site plan approval. 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a building permit for any structure located on a lot, parcel or tract of land in the B-1, B-2 and C-1 districts, a site development plan, to include a landscaping plan, shall have been approved by the village board. 
(2)  The purpose of site plan approval is to provide for development of sites which consider all the elements of good land planning, as applicable, so as to provide an adequate relationship (a) between structures both on the site and on adjacent properties and (b) between the land uses both on the site and on adjacent properties while at the same time providing for adequate space, light, air, use and bulk limitations, to promote the health, safety and welfare of the village and its residents. 
(3)  In granting or withholding approval of site plans, the board of trustees shall be guided in the reasonable exercise of their discretion by the following standards: 
(a)  All plans shall be so designed that the public health, welfare and safety will be protected. 
(b)  The proposed development of the site shall be such that it does not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood. 
(c)  All plans shall provide for protection of both aesthetics and function of the natural environment, which shall include, but not be limited to, conditions pertaining to floodplains, soil and geologic characteristics and preservation of vegetation. 
(d)  All plans shall provide for the transmission, retention or detention of stormwater with such facilities installed so as to complement existing or proposed stormwater facilities, unless the board of trustees shall determine upon recommendation of the public works director that stormwater facilities need not be provided or a cash contribution in lieu of such facilities is made. In the event the board of trustees determines that a cash contribution be made in lieu of installation of stormwater facilities, such amount shall be determined by the public works director and the use thereof shall be restricted to the provision of stormwater facilities installed by the village. 
(4)  No site plan approval shall be withheld unless the board of trustees shall determine that one or more of the foregoing standards is not satisfied. The reason for such withholding of approval shall be recorded in the proceedings of the board of trustees. 
(F)  B-1 business district development permits. 
(1)  All development and/or redevelopment in the B-1 district shall first require approval of a "development permit" granted by the board of trustees. The terms "development" and "redevelopment" shall include all new uses and occupancies to a property and/or unit, regardless of whether new construction or structural alterations are required. No person, firm, entity or governmental body shall be exempt from the development permit requirement. 
(2)  The purpose of the development permit is to revitalize the B-1 district as a development district pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-74.3-1 et seq., by regulating and promoting development projects that achieve one or more of the following goals: 
(a)  Protect and enhance the aesthetics and safety of the B-1 district through the use, construction or alteration of property; 
(b)  Enhance the sales tax base and real estate tax base of the village; 
(c)  Add to the quality mix of diverse businesses within the B-1 district; and 
(d)  Maintain and enhance on-site parking or available public parking. 
(3)  In determining whether to approve or deny a development permit, the village board of trustees shall consider the following nonexclusive list of criteria: 
(a)  Aesthetics such that the current architecture is supported and enhanced; and 
(b)  Health and safety such that construction and repairs are building code compliant, there is no environmental detriment and parking is sufficient; and 
(c)  Promotion of the primary development goal of adding to the village's sales tax base through high-quality retail, upscale and family-oriented sit-down restaurants and specialty shops. 
(d)  Businesses which do not directly contribute to the sales tax base of the village may be approved if they otherwise attract shoppers and diners to the B-1 district, otherwise add to the positive mix of businesses within a vibrant downtown, and fill space that would otherwise remain vacant.

Sec. 7.06. - B-3 special development district. 
(A)  Intent and purpose. The B-3 special development district is intended to provide for the combining of hotel and/or motel, office, research and recreational uses in a unified development and to provide for secondary retail, residential and service uses to serve the development. The district is also established in order that the public health, safety and general welfare will be furthered in an area of increasing urbanization and of growing demand for these kinds of land uses and to encourage innovations and variety in type, design and arrangement of such uses. Because of the intensity of development permitted in the special development district, it shall generally be used only when abutting one or more major or secondary arterials with limited access. 
Secondary retail business or service establishments, as set forth below, shall be permitted subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection (D)(2). Secondary uses are permitted in order to reduce the dependence of occupants of the special development district upon goods and services outside of the special development district and thereby reduce traffic congestion in such areas of intensive development. 
Because the diversified land uses in a special development district may not be predetermined in detail, approval of the preliminary concept plan and each individual final concept plan of a staged development is an absolute necessity to assure a compatible arrangement of the varied land uses which are permitted to be mixed and to determine the impact of such uses in surrounding areas. Emphasis will be based upon the review of pedestrian and vehicular circulation facilities such as sidewalks, parking areas, interior streets, pavement widths and rights-of-way because of the anticipated high volume of pedestrian and vehicular traffic which will be generated. 
For the purposes of this section, the B-3 special development district shall not be considered a planned development. 
(B)  Permitted uses. In a B-3 special development district, no building or structure shall be erected and no land shall be used except for the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided in this section and subject further to requirements set forth in paragraph (D).

(1)  Once an area has been included within a preliminary concept plan or final concept plan(s), and such plans have been approved by the village board, no other development may take place in such area nor may any other use thereof be made except in accordance with a village board approved amendment thereto, unless the plans are terminated as provided herein. 
(2)  An approved plan shall be terminated by the applicant, or its successors or assigns, prior to any development within the area involved by filing with the village an affidavit so stating. The approval of the plan shall terminate upon said filing. 
(3)  No approved plan shall be terminated after development commences except with the approval of the village board and of all parties with an interest in the land. 
(4)  If development of the approved preliminary concept plan, final plat(s) or final concept plan(s) for respective stages is not substantially completed within three years after approval, further final submittals shall cease until the part in question is completed or cause to be shown for not completing same. Provisions shall be made for the dedication of public roads so as to cause continuity of public access between the adjacent thoroughfares and ingress and egress to all private development within the project area plan. 
(L)  Amendments or modifications. Any changes or amendment requested to the preliminary concept plan shall be reviewed and recommended by the planning and zoning commission after a public hearing conforming to article XIII, section 13.11 of the zoning ordinance, and approved by the village board. In instances where modifications are necessary to preliminary concept plans, the planning and zoning commission may request that said plans again be submitted for review if, in its judgment, a substantial change is being made in said plans.

(Ord. No. 07-15, § 8, 2-5-2007)  
ARTICLE VIII. - MANUFACTURING AND OFFICE/RESEARCH DISTRICTS 
 
Sec. 8.01. - Preamble. 
The regulations for the manufacturing and office/research districts are designed to provide for the establishment of a full range of industrial and office activities and to govern their operations in a manner that will not have a deleterious effect on agricultural, residential and business areas. It is essential that there be adequate provision for the expansion and diversification of industry and office/research facilities, both those existing today and for the attraction of new facilities. Adequate well-located industrial and office sites and room for expansion of established plants will encourage industrial and office growth, and expansion of Westmont's economic base. It will also open new opportunities for a variety of employment for its labor force. (See article XIII relative to certification required as to compliance with the performance standards of these districts.) 
The M manufacturing district is established to provide an environment suitable for industrial activities that require a pleasant and nuisance-free environment and will be compatible with adjacent residential and business uses. The O/R office-research district is established to provide an area for the promulgation of office/research facilities where they can be compatible to other land uses in the village.  
Sec. 8.02. - Manufacturing district provisions. 
(A)  Operations within enclosed buildings. All activities [in the M manufacturing district] involving the manufacturing, fabricating, processing, assembling, disassembling, repairing, cleaning, servicing, testing and storing of materials, products and goods shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings. 
(B)  Performance standards. Any use established in the manufacturing district shall be so operated as to comply with the performance standards governing: 
(1)  Noise; 
(2)  Vibration; 
(3)  Smoke and particulate matter; 
(4)  Toxic matter; 
(5)  Odorous matter; 
(6)  Fire and explosive hazards; 
(7)  Glare and heat; and 
(8)  Radiation hazards, 
as set forth hereinafter. 
Established uses may be altered, enlarged, expanded or modified provided that the additions or changes comply with said performance standards. 
(1)  Performance standardsNoise. For the purpose of measuring the intensity and frequency of sound, the sound level meter, the octave band analyzer and the impact noise analyzer shall be employed. 
The flat network and the slow meter response of the sound level meter shall be used. Sounds of very short duration, as from forge hammers, punch presses and metal shears, which cannot be measured accurately with the sound level meter shall be measured with the impact noise analyzer. Octave band analyzers calibrated in the preferred frequencies (American National Standards Institute Standard S 1.61967, Preferred Frequencies and Band Numbers for Acoustical Measurements) shall be used. 
The following uses and activities shall be exempt from the noise level regulations: 
Noises not directly under the control of the property user. 
Nonroutine operations accessory to the primary activities and which are temporary in nature or conducted infrequently. 
The noises of safety signals, warning devices and emergency pressure relief valves. 
Transient noises of moving sources of noise such as automobiles, trucks, excavation equipment, tractors, airplanes and railroads. 
The decibel values specified for measurement at nearest residence districts shall be reduced by three decibels between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. In the M district, the generation of noise shall not exceed the decibel limits prescribed below: 
Maximum Permitted Sound Levels

Neighboring 
Lot 	Measured at 
Nearest 
Residence 
District 
Overall peak 	86 	80 
 
(2)  Performance standardsVibration. In the manufacturing district, no activity or operation shall cause or create earthborne vibrations in excess of the displacement values or vibration limits given below. 
Measurements shall be made at or beyond the adjacent lot line or the nearest residence district boundary line as described below. Vibration displacements shall be measured with an instrument or complement of instruments capable of simultaneously measuring in three mutually perpendicular directions. The maximum vector shall be less than the vibration displacement permitted. 
The maximum permitted displacements shall be determined by the following formula: 
D =  K / f 
where 	D 	= 	Displacement in inches. 
	K 	= 	A constant to be determined by reference to the following tables. 
	f 	= 	The frequency of the vibration transmitted through the ground, cycles per second. 
 
The maximum earth displacement permitted at the points described below shall be determined by use of the formula in the preceding paragraph (2) and the appropriate K constant shown in table 1. 
Table 1. Values of K to be used 
in Vibration Formula 
Location 	K 
In any neighboring lot: 	
	Continuous 	0.008 
	Impulsive 	0.015 
	Less than eight pulses per 24-hour period 	0.037 
In any residence district: 	
	Continuous 	0.003 
	Impulsive 	0.006 
	Less than eight pulses per 24-hour period 	0.015 
 
(3)  Performance standardsSmoke and particulate matter. The emission of smoke or particulate matter in sufficient quantities and of such characteristics and duration as to be injurious to public health and safety or which unreasonably interferes with personal comfort and welfare is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall not be permitted in the manufacturing district. 
For the purpose of grading the density of equivalent opacity of smoke, the Ringelmann Chart described in the U.S. Bureau of Mines Information Circular 8333 (May 1967) shall be employed. The emission of smoke or particulate matter of a density or equivalent opacity equal to or greater than No. 2 on the Ringelmann Chart is prohibited at all times except as otherwise provided hereinafter. 
Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such sources as storage areas, yards, roads and the like within lot boundaries shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling, fencing, wetting or other acceptable means. 
Particulate matter loadings in pounds per acre described below shall be determined by selecting a continuous four-hour period which will result in the highest average emission rate. 
The emission of smoke having a density or equivalent opacity in excess of Ringelmann No. 1 is prohibited. However, for not more than two minutes in any four-hour period, smoke up to and including Ringelmann No. 2 shall be permitted. 
The rate of emission of particulate matter from all vents and stacks within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed five-tenths of a pound per acre of lot area per hour. 
Suspended particulates carried across lot lines shall not exceed 25 micrograms per cubic meter, averaged over a 24-hour period at ground level or habitable elevation. 
(4)  Performance standardsToxic matter. The release of airborne toxic matter shall not exceed 1/30 of the threshold limit values currently recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, when measured at any point beyond the lot line, either at ground level or habitable elevation, whichever is more restrictive. Concentrations shall be measured and calculated as the highest average that will occur over a continuous 24-hour period. If a toxic substance is not listed, the applicant shall be required to submit documented proof that the proposed levels will be safe and not detrimental to the public health or injurious to plant and animal life. 
(5)  Performance standardsOdorous matter. The emission of odorous matter shall be in accordance with the requirements of each district. 
The release of materials capable of becoming odorous, either by bacterial decomposition or chemical reaction, shall meet the standards of the district in which the odor is created. 
When odorous matter is released from any operation, activity or use in the M district, the concentration of such odorous materials shall not exceed the odor threshold when measured beyond the lot line, either at ground level or habitable elevation. 
(6)  Performance standardsFire and explosive hazards. 
(a)  Detonable materials. Activities involving the storage, utilization or manufacture of materials or products which decompose by detonation shall be in accordance with the regulations of each industrial district. 
Such materials shall include but are not limited to all primary explosives such as lead azide, lead styphnate, fulminates and tetracene; all high explosives such as TNT, RDX, HMX, PETN, and picric acid; propellants and components thereof such as dry nitrocellulose, black powder, boron hydrides, hydrazine and its derivatives; pyrotechnics and fireworks such as magnesium powder, potassium chlorate and potassium nitrate; blasting explosives such as dynamite and nitroglycerine; unstable organic compounds such as acetylides, tetrazoles and ozonides; unstable oxidizing agents such as perchloric acid, perchlorates and hydrogen peroxide in concentrations greater than 35 percent; and nuclear fuels, fissionable materials and products, and reactor elements such as uranium 235 and plutonium 239. 
The storage, utilization or manufacture of materials or products which decompose by detonation is limited to an inventory of five pounds. 
(b)  Flammable solids. In all manufacturing districts the storage, utilization or manufacture of solid materials or products ranging from incombustible to moderate burning is permitted. 
In the M district, the storage, utilization or manufacture of solid materials or products ranging from free or active burning to intense burning is permitted, provided either of the following conditions is met: 
Said materials or products shall be stored, utilized or manufactured within completely enclosed buildings having no less than two-hour fire-resistant exterior walls and protected with an automatic fire extinguishing system; or 
Said material, if stored outdoors, will be not less than 100 feet to the nearest lot line. 
(c)  Flammable liquids and gases. The storage, utilization or manufacture of flammable liquids shall be permitted in accordance with the following table, exclusive of storage of finished products in original sealed containers, which shall be unrestricted. Aboveground flammable liquid and gas storage tanks shall not be less than 50 feet from all lot lines. Flammable liquids and gases in original sealed containers [of] 55 gallons liquid capacity or less may be stored or utilized without restriction within a completely enclosed building.

The off-street parking and off-street loading provisions of this ordinance shall apply as follows: 
(A)  Accessory off-street parking and off-street loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of this article for all buildings and structures. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and provided that construction is begun within six months of such effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any additional amounts required by this ordinance.

(C)  Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. However, if the said building or structure was erected prior to the effective date of this ordinance, additional parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the new use exceed those for the existing use.  
Sec. 10.02. - Existing parking facilities. 
Accessory off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of this ordinance and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not thereafter be reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this ordinance.  
Sec. 10.03. - Permissive parking and loading facilities. 
Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking and loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design and operation of such facilities are observed.  
Sec. 10.04. - Damage or destruction. 
When any building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this ordinance is restored and continued in operation after being damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause, there shall be required only the off-street parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction.

In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the lot on which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be on a lot in the same possession of the title holder of record as the lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. A covenant running with the land must be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds of DuPage County, Illinois, on the lot upon which the accessory off-street parking is located, which prohibits any other use on that lot, and a certified copy of the recorder of deeds of DuPage County, Illinois, of the recorded covenant is deposited with the building inspector. The covenant shall not be released until such time as either one of the following conditions occur: 
(A)  The structure on the lot containing the principal use is removed and the principal use terminated; or 
(B)  Another lot of the required size within the required distance is properly developed and used for the required accessory off-street parking in place of and in lieu of the initial lot used for accessory off-street parking with the same requirements, covenants and conditions attaching to such substitute accessory use lot as required for approval of such initial off-street parking.

(1)  When the application of the off-street parking regulations specified hereinafter results in a requirement of not more than three spaces on a single lot in the B-1 or B-2 districts, such parking spaces need not be provided; however, in the B-1 district, a payment of cash-in-lieu of providing such parking spaces, as set out in section (3), below, must be received by the village for such parking space waivers. Note, where two or more uses are located on a single lot, only one of these uses shall be eligible for the above exemption. This exemption shall not apply to dwelling units. 
(2)  In the event that an applicant or petitioner requests a variance in the form of a waiver of required off-street parking spaces in the B-1 district, said applicant or petitioner shall be required to pay an amount of money for each off-street parking space waived by variance. The schedule of applicable fees is set out in section (3), below. Such fees shall be placed in the parking fund for the purpose of acquiring property for public parking, to construct new public parking facilities, and/or to make improvements to existing public parking facilities.

(D)  Collective provision. Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use and provided that all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces, in relation to the use served, are adhered to.

ARTICLE XII. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES 
 
Sec. 12.01. - Purpose. 
The regulations of this article are intended to provide controls over nonconforming structures and uses and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which certain structures and uses which are deemed incompatible with the character of adjacent property in the district in which they are located and with that of the village as a whole shall be gradually eliminated in accordance with the authority vested in it by the Illinois Compiled Statutes.  
Sec. 12.02. - Authority to continue nonconforming structures and uses. 
Following the effective date of this ordinance, any nonconforming structure or use may be continued subject to the following regulations: 
(A)  Repairs and alterations. Normal repairs and improvements may be made to a nonconforming structure, provided that no structural alterations shall be made in or to such structure, all or substantially all of which is designed and intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is located, except those required by law or to make the structure and use thereof conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. The extent of normal repairs and improvements shall be determined by the building review committee. 
(B)  Enlargement of nonconforming structures. 
(1)  A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged in any manner or undergo any structural alteration unless to make it a conforming structure. 
(2)  A structure which is nonconforming only as to bulk may be enlarged for a use permitted in the district, provided such enlargement conforms to the bulk regulations of the district in which it is located and, further, that the enlargement in no way increases the existing nonconformity. 
(C)  Moving. No structure shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any other location unless every portion of such structure and the use thereof is designed and used or intended for a use permitted in the district to which it is moved, and further, that such structure shall be in conformance with the other regulations of such district. 
(D)  Restoration of damaged nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure which is destroyed or damaged by fire, other casualty, act of God or a public enemy, to the extent of 50 percent or more of its market value at the date that the damage was sustained, shall thereafter conform with all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, except that a nonconforming structure which met the minimum yard requirements in effect prior to the amendment to the zoning ordinance passed and approved on January 19, 1998, shall not be required to conform to the minimum yard requirements established by such amendment, but shall be required to conform with all other regulations of such districts as of the date permit is issued to rebuild such structure. In the event such damage or destruction is less than 50 percent of its market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is secured and reconstruction is started within 90 days from the date of the partial destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion. Determination of the market value and the cost of restoration shall be made by the building review committee. 
(E)  Discontinuation of use of nonconforming structures. Where the use of a nonconforming structure has ceased by discontinuance or abandonment on the effective date of this comprehensive amendment, or thereafter is abandoned and remains unoccupied or is not used for a continuous period of three months, the structure shall not be thereafter occupied by a nonconforming use and the lot shall not thereafter be improved except by a conforming structure. 
(F)  Nonconforming use of conforming structures. The existing nonconforming use of a part or all of a conforming structure may be continued subject to the following regulations: 
(1)  The nonconforming use of a part of a conforming structure shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of such structure; or the use of such structure, or part thereof, shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use. 
(2)  If a nonconforming use of such a structure is discontinued or abandoned for a period of three months, it shall not be renewed; and any subsequent use of such structure shall conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(G)  Nonconforming use of land. 
(1)  Nonconforming use of land without a building. The nonconforming use of land, not involving a principal building, shall be subject to the following regulations: 
(a)  Such nonconforming use of land shall not be expanded or extended at any time following the effective date of this comprehensive amendment. 
(b)  If such nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a period of 90 consecutive days, it shall not thereafter be renewed, and any subsequent use of such land shall be by a conforming use. 
(c)  A nonconforming use of land shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
(d)  The outdoor or exposed storage of materials in yards within nonresidential districts shall be discontinued within five years of the effective date of this comprehensive amendment, and within one year such exposure shall be eliminated by a solid wall or fence. Where such nonconforming use is located in a residence district, it shall be discontinued within one year. 
(2)  Nonconforming use of land accessory to a structure or building. The nonconforming use of land where accessory to a building or structure shall be subject to the following regulations: 
(a)  Where the nonconforming use of land is accessory to the nonconforming use of a structure, it shall be discontinued on the same date on which the nonconforming use of the structure is discontinued, except such outdoor use of land shall be effectively screened by a solid wall or fence within one year. 
(b)  Where the nonconforming use of land is accessory to a conforming structure, such use may be continued as long as the use of the structure or building remains a conforming use, except such outdoor use of land shall be effectively screened by a solid wall or fence within three years. 
(H)  Condemnation of nonconforming structures. The village, at any time, and from time to time by resolution or by ordinance duly enacted, may acquire by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, any nonconforming structure and all land which is necessary or appropriate for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the area and after such acquisition the village may: 
(1)  Remove or demolish all such nonconforming structures so acquired; and/or 
(2)  Hold and use any remaining property for public purposes; and/or 
(3)  Sell, lease or exchange such property as is not required for public purposes, subject to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
No such acquisition shall be made until such time as the planning and zoning commission, at the request of the board of trustees or upon its own initiative, has made a study of the area within which such nonconforming structure is located and has filed a written report on such study with the board of trustees. 
(I)  Nonconforming due to amendments. The foregoing provisions of this article shall apply to structures and uses hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of future reclassification of districts or of other amendments to this comprehensive amendment. Provisions for the discontinuance of land uses as stipulated in this article shall commence on the effective date of the zoning district map amendment. 
(J)  Nonconforming nursing homes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article XII, any nursing home which is a legal nonconforming use in the B-2 general business district may enlarge its structure by not more than 1,200 sq. ft., provided the enlarged structure is used for nursing home and related uses, and provided that all other ordinances and codes of the village are met.

The zoning applicant shall complete a development escrow agreement on such form as proscribed by the community development director. The community development director shall reasonably determine the amount of the escrow deposit required based on the complexity of the proposed development and the nature and extent of consulting services anticipated. If the escrow deposit is depleted and additional consultant reviews are required, the zoning applicant shall replenish the escrow account in such amount as reasonably determined by the community development director before further consultant reviews are performed.

(A)  Authority. The planning and zoning commission shall recommend all applications for variations of the provisions of this comprehensive amendment after a public hearing conducted by the planning and zoning commission.

(B)  Initiation. An application for a variation may be made by any person, firm or corporation having a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest applicable to the land or land and improvements described in the application for a variation. 
(C)  Application for variation and notice of hearing. An application for a variation shall be filed with the community development department, on forms prescribed by the village, along with all required fees and required supporting documentation. A copy of such application shall thereafter be forwarded by the community development department to the planning and zoning commission with a request to hold a public hearing and submit to the board of trustees a report of its findings and recommendations. Such public hearing shall be held upon public notice as required by the Illinois Compiled Statutes. Variations granted shall be exercised within a period of 12 months after the date of the variation or shall otherwise become invalid. Any new construction or structural alterations performed in furtherance of the variance shall be diligently pursued to completion, or the board of trustees may revoke the variance. 
(D)  Standards for variations. 
(1)  The planning and zoning commission shall not recommend a variation to the regulations of this comprehensive amendment as authorized herein unless it shall have made findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
(a)  The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in the district in which it is located; 
(b)  The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and 
(c)  The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
(2)  For the purpose of implementing the above rules, the planning and zoning commission shall also, in making its recommendations whether there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the evidence: 
(a)  The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical features of the specific property involved would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out. 
(b)  The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification. 
(c)  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property. 
(d)  The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by the owner of the property. 
(e)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
(f)  The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair the property values within the neighborhood. 
(3)  The planning and zoning commission may recommend such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this subsection to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the general intent of this comprehensive amendment. 
(E)  Decisions. The board of trustees, upon report of the planning and zoning commission without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed variation in accordance with Illinois Statutes and the Westmont Village Code, or may refer it back to the planning and zoning commission for further consideration. The board of trustees may by ordinance impose special conditions upon variance approval, designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare and designed to ensure compliance with the variance standards listed herein. A violation of any such variance conditions shall constitute a violation of this zoning ordinance and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variance. 
(Ord. No. 95-41, § 3, 6-19-1995; Ord. No. 10-201, § 2, 12-6-2010; Ord. No. 19-085, § 2, 3-23-2019)

(A)  An application for an appeal shall be filed with the village clerk within 20 days of the date of the action from which the appeal is being filed, and thereafter the village clerk shall forward such application to the planning and zoning commission for processing. 
(B)  An appeal stays all the proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the community development director from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the planning and zoning commission, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the planning and zoning commission or by a circuit court on application, on notice to the economic development director from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown. 
(C)  The planning and zoning commission shall fix a reasonable time, not to exceed 90 days, for the hearing of the appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties and decide the same within a reasonable time. The planning and zoning commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determinations as in its opinion ought to be made on the premises and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal was taken. 
(Ord. No. 95-41, § 3, 6-19-1995; Ord. No. 07-102, § 1, 6-4-2007; Ord. No. 19-085, § 2, 3-23-2019)  
Sec. 13.09. - Special uses. 
(A)  Purpose. The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive zoning ordinance is based on the division of the entire village into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which may have a unique, special or unusual impact on the use and enjoyment of neighboring property and upon public facilities and therefore need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this comprehensive amendment as special uses and fall into two categories: 
(1)  Uses either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated utilities, or uses traditionally affected by public interest. 
(2)  Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they offer to the public and their possible damaging influence on the neighborhood, may have to be established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under the regulations of this comprehensive amendment. 
(B)  Initiation. Special uses may be proposed by any person, firm or corporation having a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is described in the application for a special use. 
(C)  Processing. 
(1)  An application for a special use shall be filed with the community development department, on forms prescribed by the village, along with all required fees and required supporting documentation. If not otherwise required by this zoning ordinance, the community development department may require an applicant to submit a site plan for approval in conjunction with the special use request. 
(2)  A copy of such application shall thereafter be forwarded by the community development department to the planning and zoning commission with a request to hold a public hearing and submit to the board of trustees a report of its findings and recommendations. Such public hearing shall be held upon public notice as required by the Illinois Compiled Statutes. 
(3)  After denial of a special use request by the village board, the same applicant may not apply for the same or substantially similar special use for the property in question until at least one year have [has] elapsed since the date of the denial. 
(D)  Standards. A proposed special use shall substantially meet the following standards in order to obtain the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and approval of the board of trustees: 
(1)  That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
(2)  That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(3)  That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 
(4)  That adequate utilities, access ways, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being provided. 
(5)  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. 
(6)  That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by the village board pursuant to the recommendation of the plan commission. 
(E)  Decisions. The board of trustees, upon report of the planning and zoning commission and without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed special use in accordance with applicable Illinois Statutes or may refer it back to the planning and zoning commission for further consideration. The board of trustees may by ordinance impose special conditions upon special use approval, designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare and designed to ensure compliance with the special use standards listed herein. A violation of any such special use conditions shall constitute a violation of this zoning ordinance and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the special use. 
(F)  Limitations on special uses. 
(1)  A special use shall apply only to the property for which it was originally granted. 
(2)  A special use shall run with the land, except as limited herein. A special use shall automatically terminate upon the cessation of the special use for a consecutive period of at least 365 days. For purposes of this section, cessation of the special use shall mean a failure to substantially operate the special use activity upon the property, whether by affirmative choice, bankruptcy, liquidation, foreclosure, eviction, or other reason. A cessation of the special use shall not occur when the special use activity is temporarily halted due to the making of repairs or upgrades to the property where a building permit is obtained, where the nature of the repairs or upgrades makes the continued operation of the special use impractical, and where the repairs or upgrades are diligently pursued to completion. 
(3)  Upon the termination of a special use for any reason, new special use approval is required in order for that use to continue upon the property. 
(4)  A special use shall become null and void (i) 180 days after the date of village board approval if the special use is not commenced on the property, unless the delay is due to construction or alteration of any structures in connection with the special use as addressed herein, or (ii) 24 months after the date of village board approval if any construction or alteration of any structures in connection with the special use is not substantially completed and the special use in not commenced within that time period. Upon written request and good cause shown, the board of trustees may, by ordinance, in its sole discretion, grant extensions of the time limitations set forth in this section.

ARTICLE I. - TITLE, PURPOSE AND INTENT 
 
Sec. 1.01. - Title. 
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Westmont Land Development Ordinance."  
Sec. 1.02. - Purpose and jurisdiction. 
Because each new subdivision accepted by the village becomes a permanent unit in the basic physical structures of the future community, to which the future community will, of necessity, be forced to adhere, all subdivisions hereafter planned within the incorporated limits of the village, and within the unincorporated area lying 1½ miles beyond, shall, in all respects, be in full compliance with the regulations hereinafter contained in this ordinance. These regulations are designed to provide for the orderly and harmonious development of the village, for the coordination of streets within new subdivisions with other existing or planned streets, and to secure a uniform system of utilities and services, and otherwise to promote realization of the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 87-42, 6-1-1987; Ord. No. 95-41, § 5, 6-19-1995; Ord. No. 00-61, § 1, 5-1-2000)  
ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURES 
 
Sec. 2.01. - General procedures. 
Before subdividing any tract or parcel of land in the village and the unincorporated areas within 1½ miles beyond the village limits, an owner or subdivider shall submit a preliminary plan and a final plat to be acted upon by the village authorities in accordance with the following requirements. Prior to the preparation of a preliminary plan it is recommended that: 
(1)  The owner or subdivider consult with the planning and zoning commission and other village officials to secure information relative to requirements of the comprehensive plan, official map, zoning ordinance, and any other applicable village ordinance; and 
(2)  Subsequently submit to the planning and zoning commission a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision prepared on a topographic map of the area showing the local street system, arrangement of lots, and location of public use areas. 
(Ord. No. 95-41, § 5, 6-19-1995)  
Sec. 2.02. - Preliminary plan. 
(a)  The owner or subdivider shall file an application for approval of the preliminary plan with the village clerk. Ten copies of the preliminary plan and the required filing fee shall accompany the application. 
(b)  The village clerk shall refer four copies of the preliminary plan to the planning and zoning commission, at least ten days in advance of the next meeting of the planning and zoning commission. 
(c)  The planning and zoning commission shall notify the owner or subdivider as to the time and place of the planning and zoning commission meeting at which he will be afforded an opportunity of being heard. 
(d)  The planning and zoning commission shall approve or disapprove the application for preliminary plan approval within 90 days from the date of filing the application or the filing by the applicant of the last item of required supporting documents, whichever date is later, unless such time is extended by mutual consent. If such plat is disapproved, then within said 90 days the planning and zoning commission shall furnish to the applicant, in writing, a statement setting forth the reason for disapproval and specifying with particularity the aspects in which the proposed plat fails to conform to the zoning ordinance including the official map. 
(e)  If the preliminary plan has been approved by the planning and zoning commission, it shall be referred to the board of trustees. The board of trustees shall accept or reject said plan within a reasonable period of time after its next regular stated meeting following the action of the planning and zoning commission. 
(f)  Upon approval of the preliminary plan by the village board, the plan shall be marked "approved" and signed by the village clerk. 
(g)  Four prints of such approved preliminary plan shall be distributed by the village clerk as follows: 
(1)  One print shall be sent to the planning and zoning commission; 
(2)  One print shall be sent to the public works director; 
(3)  One print shall be retained by the village clerk for filing; and 
(4)  One print shall be returned to the subdivider. 
(h)  Approval of the preliminary plan by the planning and zoning commission and board of trustees shall be conditioned upon stipulations as set forth in this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 95-41, § 5, 6-19-1995; Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007)  
Sec. 2.03. - Plans and specifications for land improvements. 
After the approval of the preliminary plan and prior to filing an application for approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall submit to the public works director and other public officials having jurisdiction, construction plans and specifications, prepared by an Illinois registered professional engineer, for required land improvements. Such construction plans and specifications shall be approved by the public works director and other public officials having jurisdiction and such approval shall be certified on the final plat. 
(Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007)  
Sec. 2.04. - Final plat. 
(a)  Within one year after approval of the preliminary plan by the board of trustees, the subdivider shall file with the village clerk an application for approval of the final plat covering all or a part of the approved preliminary plan. Such application shall include the original transparency drawings, five contact prints of the final plat, and four copies of all supporting maps, drawings, and all other required documents. The final plat shall retain the design characteristics of the approved preliminary plan, except that the board of trustees may require such changes or revisions as are deemed necessary in the interest and needs of the community. Otherwise, if a preliminary plan is approved by the planning and zoning commission and the board of trustees, the board of trustees cannot change the requirements for the particular subdivision if the final plat is presented within one year from date of acceptance of the preliminary plan. Accordingly, the board of trustees may by resolution refer the application for approval of the final plat to the planning and zoning commission for recommendation and report relative to design characteristics of the final plat. 
(b)  In case application for approval of a final plat is made for only a part of the approved preliminary plan, the board of trustees may extend the time for filing application for approval of final plats covering the remaining area included in the approved preliminary plan until a later date or dates beyond the foregoing one-year period. 
(c)  Within a reasonable time from the date of filing the last required document or other paper or within 60 days from the date the application for approval of the final plat was filed with the village clerk, whichever date is later, the board of trustees shall by resolution approve or disapprove such final plat. Upon the adoption of the resolution approving a final plat, the village clerk shall certify such approval and affix the corporate seal of the village on the final plat. 
(d)  Upon approval by the board of trustees and recording of the final plat with the DuPage County Recorder of Deeds, the original transparency shall be submitted to the public works director, along with three copies of the recorded plat, one of which shall be retained by the public works director, one by the planning and zoning commission, and one by the village clerk. 
(e)  The final plat in exact form as approved shall be filed for record by the village clerk when the Recorder of Deeds' Office of DuPage County within 30 days of issuance of the development permit. The village clerk shall secure three print copies of the recorded plat. The subdivider shall pay the recording fees and the cost of the print copies. 
The current costs for recording final plats are as follows: 
Subdivision (including Consolidations) and Resubdivision: $250.00. 
Note: The previous year's taxes must be paid in full for the subject property shown on the plat before the DuPage County Clerk's Office will execute their signature block on the plat. Their execution is necessary before the DuPage County Recorder's Office will record the plat. 
(Ord. No. 95-41, § 5, 6-19-1995; Ord. No. 06-66, § 1, 4-17-2006; Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007)  
Sec. 2.05. - Agreements. 
(a)  By filing an application for approval of a final plat, the owner or subdivider agrees that the land improvements required by this ordinance shall be completed by the owner or subdivider in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the public works director and board of trustees and all inspection fees required by this ordinance and one set of plans and specifications showing such improvements as installed shall be filed with the village clerk within two years following the approval of the final plat by the board of trustees. No required land improvements shall be installed prior to the recording of the final plat. 
(b)  A cash security deposit, commercial bank letter of credit, or completion bond shall be submitted by such owner or subdivider to the public works director prior to recording of the final plat. In the case of completion bonds, the village manager shall not accept a completion bond in excess of $5,000.00. Such cash security deposit, commercial bank letter of credit, or completion bond shall be in a sum sufficient to cover 110 percent of the cost of the land improvements required by this ordinance plus the cost of inspection fees including engineering fees by the village in regard to the subdivision. Such cost for the completion of the required land improvements plus inspection fees and engineering fees shall be in accordance with the cost estimates approved by the public works director. All letters of credit must be obtained through a commercial bank licensed to do business in the state. The owner or subdivider shall submit any letter of credit to the village finance department and the village public works department for preapproval prior to submission of the letter of credit to the commercial bank. All letters of credit must contain an at-sight clause regarding payment. All letters of credit must contain an expiration date no earlier than 45 days after the expected completion date. Renewals of letters of credit shall be as provided in subsection (c) of this section. A $50.00 administration fee shall accompany all letters of credit submitted to the village finance department for preapproval. All cash security deposits shall be used insofar as it is sufficient to defray the cost of making such improvements, including inspection fees and engineering fees. Any unused balance will be returned to the depositor in accordance with state law. The cash security deposit, commercial bank letter of credit, or completion bond shall be conditioned upon the installation of such improvements and payment of inspection fees including engineering fees within two years following the approval of the final plat and satisfactory maintenance of those public improvements prior to village acceptance. There shall be no reduction of that portion of the letter of credit, bond, or deposit applying to a particular improvement, unless or until that improvement is complete and accepted or approved by the public works director and then on reduction shall be in the amount of 90 percent of the cost of such improvement as determined by the public works director. No security shall be returned until as-built drawings as required in article V, section 5.07 of this ordinance have been filed with the public works director. 
(c)  Upon the approval of the public works director, a letter of credit may be renewed for additional periods of time to enable the owner or subdivider to complete the required land improvements. Not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the expiration of the letter of credit, the public works director shall notify the owner or subdivider in writing of the pending expiration and, not less than ten days prior to such expiration date, the owner or subdivider shall be required to provide the public works director with evidence that such letter of credit has been renewed for the approved additional period of time. If the owner or subdivider fails to renew such letter of credit within the time allowed, the public works director shall either: (i) allow renewal of the letter of credit prior to its expiration date upon payment of $800.00 to the village by the owner or subdivider to compensate the village for costs associated with such late renewal; or (ii) proceed to make a draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration. No owner or subdivider shall be permitted to renew its letter of credit at any time which is less than ten days prior to its expiration date, without paying the required fee as set forth herein. 
(d)  The village clerk shall not certify the approval of the board of trustees on the final plat until the required bond, or deposit or cash or other guarantee has been filed as required by this section. 
Note: If the subdivision is located in the unincorporated area within 1½ miles beyond the village limits, and the owner or subdivider has agreed with DuPage County to complete required improvements for the subdivision, then the owner or subdivider shall not be required to agree to such completion with the village, as set forth in paragraph (a) above; provided, however, that if the village's standards for such improvements are of higher quality than the standards of DuPage County, then the owner or subdivider shall be required to agree to install such improvements in accordance with the village's standards. 
(Ord. No. 83-58, 5-7-1983; Ord. No. 96-11, § 2, 4-1-1996; Ord. No. 99-129, § 1, 9-20-1999; Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007; Ord. No. 07-104, § 1, 6-4-2007)  
Sec. 2.06. - Acceptance and guarantee of streets. 
(a)  Acceptance. If any plat of subdivision contains public streets or thoroughfares which are herein dedicated as such, whether located within the corporate limits of the village or in part outside thereof, or contains streets located outside of said corporate limits, the approval of the plat by the board of trustees or the subsequent annexation of the property to the village shall not constitute an acceptance for maintenance, clearing and cleaning purposes irrespective of any act or acts by an officer, agent, or employee of the village with respect to such streets or improvements. 
The acceptance of such streets or thoroughfares for maintenance shall be made only by the adoption of a resolution by the board of trustees, after there has been filed with the village clerk a certificate by the public works director certifying that improvements required to be constructed or installed in or upon such streets or thoroughfares, in connection with the approval of the final plat of subdivision by the board of trustees, have been completed and the construction or installation thereof has been approved by him. The developer may request acceptance of such streets or thoroughfares for maintenance, clearing and cleaning after 90 percent of nonroadway improvements have been made and the village shall accept such improvements subject to the guarantee stated in section (b) below. The village manager is authorized to enter into snow control agreements with developers to allow village snow plowing of dedicated but unaccepted streets until such time that said streets are formally accepted by the village. 
(b)  Guarantee and repair or replacement. The developer shall repair or replace any public improvement which has or will become defective due to work or material provided, and shall so repair or replace within 30 days of receipt of a written notice from the public works director that such defect or defects exist. The developer shall provide, prior to acceptance, security to the village for repair or replacement of defective public improvements by submission of a cash security deposit, commercial bank letter of credit or a maintenance bond in the amount of 15 percent of the cost of construction of the public improvements and in no event in an amount less than $1,000.00. The cash security deposit, commercial bank letter of credit or a maintenance bond shall be in such form as approved by the village attorney and conditioned upon repair or replacement of defective public improvements within one year after acceptance. If the developer fails to properly repair or replace defects after notice as provided above, the security shall be used by the village for said repair or replacement. Any unused portion of the security shall be returned to the developer after one year from acceptance of the public improvements and only after all repairs and replacements as required are completed.

ARTICLE IV. - SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 4.01. - Streets. 
(a)  Street plan: The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the comprehensive plan, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets; to reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjoining lands; to topographical conditions; to runoff of stormwater; to public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the area to be served. 
(b)  Streets and other ways: 
(1)  Right-of-way widths shall conform to the following minimum dimensions: 
Type 	Residential 
subdivision 	Manufacturing 
or business

(i) 	Pedestrian ways 	15 feet 	15 feet 
 
(2)  Minor streets shall be so aligned that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(3)  Streets should intersect at right angles or form T's and Y's. Acute angle intersections should be avoided. Jogs in street intersections should be at least 150 feet apart. 
(4)  A cul-de-sac street in single-family residential districts shall be not more than 600 feet in length, measured along its centerline from the centerline of the street of origin to the end of its right-of-way, or it may be longer than 600 feet provided that not more than 26 lots have exclusive access from it on both sides of the street. In multiple-family residential districts, such streets shall not exceed 300 feet in length. Each cul-de-sac shall have a terminus of circular shape with a minimum diameter of 120 feet, except a cul-de-sac street that has not more than five lots fronting on its right-of-way, or a temporary cul-de-sac street, may have a terminus of the "T" type or other variation of shape, as approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(5)  Where there is a deflection in horizontal centerlines in excess of ten degrees, a curve shall be inserted having a centerline radius of not less than 125 feet for minor streets and not less than 300 feet for collector streets. A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be provided between all horizontal curves. 
(6)  Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the board of trustees finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever an existing or dedicated half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. A half street, where included, shall be graded at one level, and the regrading or new construction of any half street shall conform to the grade and pavement of the adjacent half street. Where a half street is provided, the developer shall be required to deposit sufficient funds in escrow to cover the cost of its resurfacing when the balance of the street is constructed. 
(7)  Provisions shall be made for vehicular and pedestrian access to residential property abutting a thoroughfare either by: (a) frontage roads, or (b) double frontage lots backing to the thoroughfare. Where the double frontage "back-up treatment" is used, a no-access strip shall be provided. These standards are established for the purpose of providing protection to residential properties and to separate through and local traffic. 
(8)  Gradients of street gutters shall be at least four-tenths of one percent, and of centerlines shall not exceed five percent for collector streets and six percent for minor streets. 
(9)  Where streets are dedicated (whether used or not), but not improved to the standards of this ordinance, and are wholly within the proposed subdivision land, they shall be improved to the standards of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 95-41, § 5, 6-19-1995)  
Sec. 4.02. - Easements. 
(a)  Easements shall be provided for underground utility services, including stormwater drainage, water main, and sanitary sewer service, where necessary. They shall be a minimum of ten feet wide, or larger if determined by the public works director, and shall be established at the rear of each lot and along such other lot lines as to provide continuity of alignment from block to block. If located between two adjoining lots, the easement shall be centered on the property line. 
(b)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a natural watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement approved by the public works director, conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and/or as approved by the public works director. 
(Ord. No. 07-103, § 1, 6-4-2007)  
Sec. 4.03. - Blocks. 
(a)  In residential subdivisions, the maximum length of blocks containing any lots less than 100 feet in width shall be 1,500 lineal feet, and the maximum length of blocks containing lots 100 feet and over in width shall be 2,000 lineal feet. No blocks shall be less than 900 lineal feet in length unless approved by the planning and zoning commission. Pedestrian ways leading to schools, parks, or other common destinations may be required by the planning and zoning commission. For blocks over 900 feet in length, pedestrian ways not less than 15 feet in width shall be provided where deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission. 
(b)  In industrial and business districts, maximum length of blocks shall be as approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(c)  The shape of blocks shall be determined by topographical features, the basic street system and traffic pattern, lot depths, and areas designated for public and other nonresidential land uses. 
(d)  Where a subdivision borders upon or is traversed by a railroad right-of-way or arterial street, the planning and zoning commission may require a street on one or both sides of such right-of-way or street located approximately parallel to and at a distance removed suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, i.e., park purposes, deep residential lots fronting on it with a no-access strip along the rear property lines, and off-street parking, business, or other uses as permitted by the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 95-41, § 5, 6-19-1995)  
Sec. 4.04. - Lots. 
(a)  General: 
(1)  In general, lots should be as nearly rectangular in shape as practicable. Flag lots are prohibited. 
(2)  Width and area of lots shall conform with lot width and area requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance of the village or that of DuPage County in the unincorporated areas beyond the village limits. Corner lots shall be increased in width by 20 percent over the width of typical interior lots, except that corner lots need not exceed 90 feet in width, if the 90 feet in width is greater than the width of the typical lot. 
(3)  Double frontage lots shall be permitted only where lots back up on an arterial street, provided that no vehicular access between the lots and the arterial street is permitted; or where the topography of the land might render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. 
(4)  In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features such as tree growth, watercourses, or similar conditions. 
(b)  Residential subdivision: 
(1)  All lots for single-family detached residential use shall abut upon a street or easement. Flag lots are prohibited. 
(2)  Double frontage lots shall be permitted only where lots back up on an arterial street, provided that no vehicular access between the lots and the arterial street is permitted; or where the topography of the land might render subdividing otherwise unreasonable, provided that an additional depth of ten feet shall be required as a no access strip to provide protective screen planting. 
(c)  Industrial subdivision: 
(1)  Depth of lots shall be not less than 200 feet. 
(2)  All lots for industrial subdivision shall abut upon a street. Flag lots are prohibited. 
(3)  Double frontage lots shall be permitted only where lot depth is 300 feet or more; where lots back up on an arterial street, provided that no vehicular access between the lots and the arterial street is permitted; or where the topography of the land might render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. 
(Ord. No. 07-112, § 2, 6-18-2007)  
Sec. 4.05. - Public use areas. 
The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the village board may require each applicant to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the parcel, to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or to provide a combination of both at the option of the village. Such dedication is necessary to ensure proper provision of park and school sites for persons who are expected to reside within the subdivision or development, which sites would otherwise have to be acquired at the expense of the general public but whose utility would generally be limited to residents of the parcel. 
(a)  Criteria for requiring park and recreation land dedication: 
(1)  Applicant may be required to dedicate for park and recreation purposes an amount of land determined on the basis of 5.5 acres per 1,000 persons calculated as provided in paragraph (e), table of estimated ultimate population. 
(2)  The location of the site to be dedicated shall be determined by the village board upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and the Westmont park district, taking into account the suitability of the site for park purposes or development, its relationship to population concentrations, and its proximity to other park or recreational lands. 
(3)  No storage of any materials, including spoil materials or topsoil, will be allowed on any land designated as park district land for use as recreational use. 
(4)  Credit for private open space and recreation areas. Private open space or recreation areas may be utilized in lieu of the dedication required by this subsection (a), provided that detailed improvement plans shall be approved by the planning and zoning commission and village board and that satisfactory guarantees of the permanency of the use and its maintenance, enforceable by the village, shall be entered into by the applicant. 
(b)  Criteria for school site dedication: Applicants may be required to dedicate for school purposes an amount of land determined by: 
(1)  Obtaining the ratio of estimated children to be generated by the proposed subdivision or development within each school classification, calculated as provided in paragraph (e), to the maximum number of children to be served within each school classification, calculated from the table in this paragraph (b). 
(2)  Multiplying that ratio by the minimum number of acres for a school site within each school classification determined from the table in this paragraph (b). Calculation to be extended to three decimals. 
(3)  No storage of any materials, including spoil materials or topsoil, will be allowed on any land designated as future or proposed school sites.

(c)  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park and school sites: Where the resulting site in a proposed subdivision or development is too small to be usable for the purpose intended or where it is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes, or a school site, the village may require the applicant to contribute cash in lieu of the land dedication. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body designated by the village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified, which will serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing park and recreation land which already serves such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body designated by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development, or for the improvement to any existing school site which already serves such needs, but not for the construction of any school buildings or additions thereto. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication, or cash contribution in lieu of school site, is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within seven years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the applicant who made such contribution. 
(1)  Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land, as improved, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation or school sites. It has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is $125,000.00 per acre, and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the applicant files written object thereto. In the event of any such objection, the applicant shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value per acre of such improved land or other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village board based upon such information from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park district, school district, or others. 
(d)  Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee: There will be situations when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land is necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
(1)  The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder. That portion of the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or sufficient for the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated. 
(2)  A major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision or development to complete the site. The portions needed to complete the park or school site shall be dedicated, and a cash contribution shall be required in lieu of the balance of the required dedication. 
(e)  Density formula: The following table of population density is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the applicant. In the event an applicant files a written objection to the table of estimated ultimate population listed herein, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population and, in that event, final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board based upon such demographic information submitted by the applicant and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park district, school district, or others. 
(f)  Improved sites: The slope, topography and geology of the site to be dedicated as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. Before dedication, all sites shall be improved as required under this ordinance or acceptable provisions shall be made for such improvement before dedication.

The public works director shall publish a contribution schedule based on the approximate cost of construction/installation of each public improvement. The cash contribution shall be paid upon or before completion of public improvements for the development.
