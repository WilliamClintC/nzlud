8.07 APPROVAL
A person may submit a proposal to the City Council to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction.  If the City Council resolves to consider such proposal, it shall publish notice and hold a public hearing thereon.  Thereafter, at least 30 days after such hearing, the City Council, by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new construction if the new construction is in conformance with City zoning.

CHAPTER 46 MINORS

46.01 CURFEW
The Council has determined that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the City and specifically to reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for minors; to protect the public from the illegal acts of minors committed after the curfew hour; and to protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

For use in this section, the following terms are defined:

“Knowingly” means knowledge that a responsible adult should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible adult’s custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable standard of adult responsibility through an objective test.  It is therefore no defense that an adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of the minor.
“Minor” means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
“Nonsecured custody” means custody in an unlocked multipurpose area, such as a lobby, office or interrogation room that is not designed, set aside, or used as a secure detention area, and the person arrested is not physically secured during the period of custody in the area; the person is physically accompanied by a law enforcement officer or a person employed by the facility where the person arrested is being held; and the use of the area is limited to providing nonsecured custody only while awaiting transfer to an appropriate juvenile facility or to court, for contacting of and release to the person’s parents or other responsible adult or for other administrative purposes; but not for longer than six hours without the oral or written order of a judge or magistrate authorizing the detention. A judge shall not extend the period of time in excess of six hours beyond the initial six-hour period.
“Public place” includes stores, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, streets, alleys, and sidewalks dedicated to public use and also includes such parts of buildings and other premises, whether publicly or privately owned, that are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has access. For purposes of this section, a vehicle or other conveyance is considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above.
“Responsible adult” means a parent, guardian or other adult specifically authorized by law or authorized by a parent or guardian to have custody or control of a minor.
Curfew Established. A curfew applicable to minors is established and shall be enforced as follows:
Hours Sunday Through Thursday, Under Age 15. It is unlawful for any minor under the age of 15 years to remain in or upon any public place in the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. of the following morning Sunday through Thursday, official time.
Hours Friday Through Saturday, Under Age 15. It is unlawful for any minor under the age of 15 years to be or remain in or upon any public place in the City between the hours of 12:00 midnight Friday and Saturday and 5:00 a.m. on the following day, official time.

(2)        Minor’s place of religious activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or before the beginning of the religious activity;

(3)        Governmental or political activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;

(4)        School activity or, if traveling, within one hour after the end or before the beginning of the activity;

The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult;
The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the City beginning, ending or passing through the City when such travel is by direct route.
Responsibility of Adults. It is unlawful for any responsible adult knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the City within the time periods prohibited by this section unless the minor’s presence falls within one of the above exceptions.
Enforcement Procedures.
Determination of Age. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or driver’s license, a law enforcement officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use his or her best judgment in determining age.
Grounds for Arrest; Conditions of Custody. Grounds for arrest are that the person refuses to sign the citation without qualification; persists in violating the ordinance; refuses to provide proper identification or to identify himself or herself; or constitutes an immediate threat to the person’s own safety or to the safety of the public.  A law enforcement officer who arrests a minor for a curfew violation may keep the minor in custody either in a shelter care facility or in any nonsecured setting.  The officer shall not place bodily restraints, such as handcuffs, on the minor unless the minor physically resists or threatens physical violence when being taken into custody.  A minor shall not be placed in detention following a curfew violation.
Notification of Responsible Adult. After a minor is taken into custody, the law enforcement officer shall notify the adult responsible for the minor as soon as possible.  The minor shall be released to the adult responsible for the minor upon the promise of such person to produce the child in court at such time as the court may direct.
Minor Without Adult Supervision. If a law enforcement officer determines that a minor does not have adult supervision because the law enforcement officer cannot locate the minor’s parent, guardian or other person legally responsible for the care of the minor, within a reasonable time, the law enforcement officer shall attempt to place the minor with an adult relative of the minor, an adult person who cares for the child or another adult person who is known to the child.
Responsible Adult’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall, by certified mail, send to the adult responsible for the minor, written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance against both the responsible adult and minor, with applicable penalties.
Responsible Adult’s Second Violation. Any responsible adult as defined in this section who, following receipt of a warning, knowingly allows the minor to violate any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a municipal infraction.
Minor’s First Violation. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the law enforcement officer shall give the minor a written warning, which states that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew ordinance against the responsible adult and the minor, with applicable penalties, or, at the law enforcement officer’s discretion, may issue the minor a citation for a first violation.
Minor’s Second Violation. For the minor’s second and subsequent violations of any of the provisions of this section, the minor is guilty of a municipal infraction.
Notice of the ordinance codified in this section and its contents may be posted in or about such public or quasi-public places as may be designated by the Council or the Police Department in order that the public may be constantly informed of the existence of such ordinance and its regulations.

At a minimum, the City agrees to require as a condition of issuing a permit for open trenching to any utility or developer that:  (i) the utility or developer give the Grantee at least 10 days’ advance written notice of the availability of the open trench; and (ii) the utility or developer provide the Grantee with reasonable access to the open trench.  The requirements of this section shall not apply if the trench being competed will only include water distribution facilities.

111.14 REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF THE CABLE SERVICE
It is the obligation of the Grantee to serve all residents in the service area except to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain or other factors render providing service impracticable, technically unfeasible or economically non-compensatory.  Whenever the Grantee receives a request for cable service from a subscriber in a contiguous unserved area where there are at least 10 residences within 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) from the portion of the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable which is to be extended, it shall extend its cable system to such subscribers at no cost to said subscribers for cable system extension, other than the published standard/non-standard installation fees charged to all subscribers.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to extend the cable system into any portion of the service area where another operator is providing cable service, into any annexed area which is not contiguous to the present service area of the Grantee, or into any area which is financially or technically infeasible due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a runway or freeway crossing.

111.15 SUBSCRIBER CHARGES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE
No subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily.  However, if an area does not meet the density requirements of Section 111.14, the Grantee shall only be required to extend the cable system to subscribers in that area if the subscribers are willing to share the capital costs of extending the cable system.  Specifically, the Grantee shall contribute a capital amount equal to the construction cost per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences per 1,320 cable-bearing strand feet from the Grantee’s trunk or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 10.  Subscribers who request service hereunder will bear the remaining cost to extend the cable system on a pro rata basis.  The Grantee may require that payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers be paid in advance.  Subscribers shall also be responsible for any standard/non-standard installation charges to extend the cable system from the tap to the residence.

111.16 CABLE SERVICE TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS
The Grantee, upon request, shall provide without charge a standard installation and one outlet of basic cable to those administrative buildings owned or occupied by the City, fire stations, police stations and accredited K-12 schools, the Senior Center, Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School, the Recreation Center and the Kirkwood Education Center if passed by its cable system.  The cable service provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed outlet without authorization from the Grantee.  The cable service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes and such outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public.  The City shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Grantee’s cable system in any manner that results in the inappropriate use thereof or any loss or damage to the cable system.  The City shall hold the Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of cable service required by this section.  The Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where a non-standard installation is required, unless the City or building owner/occupant agrees to pay the incremental cost of any necessary cable system extension and/or non-standard installation.  If additional outlets of basic cable are provided to such buildings, the building owner/occupant shall pay the usual installation and service fees associated therewith.

111.17 EMERGENCY USE
The Grantee provides an Emergency Alert System (EAS) and the City shall permit only appropriately trained and authorized person to operate the EAS equipment and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the Grantee’s cable system in any manner that results in inappropriate use thereof, or any loss or damage to the cable system.  Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the City shall hold the Grantee, its employees, officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the use of the EAS, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

111.18 REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS
If funds are available to any person using the public way for the purpose of defraying the cost of any of the foregoing, the City shall reimburse the Grantee in the same manner in which other persons affected by the requirement are reimbursed.  If the funds are controlled by another governmental entity, the City shall make application for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.

111.19 PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL ACCESS (PEG) CHANNEL
The Grantee shall provide one channel for public, educational and governmental access pursuant to the  provisions of the Cable Act, Section 611 (47 USC 531), to be promoted and administered by the City or its designee.  The channel shall be originated from the Vinton Community High School.  The Grantee shall make program origination available from one additional site requested in writing by City no later than 18 months following such request.  A second educational access channel shall be provided as the Kirkwood Community College Channel.  The Kirkwood channel shall continue to be provided unless or until the Grantee is unable to carry the channel on reasonable terms and conditions as determined by Grantee.

111.20 DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED
The Grantee shall not deny service, access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age.  The Grantee shall comply with the equal opportunity requirements of State and federal law.  This section shall apply to the management of public, educational and government access channels for both the Grantee and the City.

111.21 POLE ATTACHMENT PERMISSION REQUIRED
The Grantee shall be required to obtain permission from pole owners to attach equipment and facilities.  Nothing in this agreement shall release the Grantee from the requirement to enter into a separate pole attachment agreement to use poles owned by a utility operated by the City.

111.22 FRANCHISE FEE
1.                   The Grantee shall pay to the City a franchise fee of three percent of annual gross revenues (as defined in Section 111.01 of this chapter).  In accordance with the Cable Act, the 12-month period applicable under the franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year.  The franchise fee payment shall be due and payable within 45 days after the close of the preceding calendar year.  Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief report prepared by a representative of the Grantee showing the basis for the computation. 

2.                   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions.  The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three years from the date on which payment by the Grantee is due. 

3.                   Right-of-Way Management Fees.  City will waive all fees and costs for permits related to the management of the public right-of-way in consideration for payment of franchise fees as contained in this agreement.

111.23 RATES AND CHARGES
1.                   Regulation.  The City may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable and equipment as expressly permitted by federal or State law.

2.                   Refunds for Outages.  If service is interrupted for more than 24 hours and Grantee is aware of the outage, customers may request a rebate equivalent to the prorated monthly fee for the services affected.

111.24 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE
1.                   The City and the Grantee agree that any proceedings undertaken by the City that relate to the renewal of the Grantee’s franchise shall be governed by and comply with the provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act.

2.                   In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626(a), the City agrees to notify the Grantee of its assessments regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs and interests, as well as the past performance of the Grantee under the then current franchise term.  The City further agrees that such assessments shall be provided to the Grantee promptly so that the Grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal under Section 626(b) of the Cable Act and complete renewal of the franchise prior to expiration of its term. 

3.                   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this section, the Grantee and the City agree that at any time during the term of the then current franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and opportunity to comment, the City and Grantee may agree to undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then current franchise and the City may grant a renewal thereof. 

4.                   The Grantee and the City consider the terms set forth in this section to be consistent with the express provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act.

111.25 CONDITIONS OF SALE
.  If a renewal or extension of Grantee’s franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the City either lawfully acquires ownership of the cable system or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the cable system to another party, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act.  The Grantee and the City agree that in the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the franchise, the Grantee shall be given at least 12 months to effectuate a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party.  Furthermore, the Grantee shall be authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior franchise during this period.  If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is reasonably acceptable to the City, the Grantee and City may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or State law.  It is further agreed that the Grantee’s continued operation of its cable system during the twelve-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either the City or the Grantee.

111.26 TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE
The Grantee’s right, title or interest in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise encumbered, other than to an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without the prior consent of the City, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title or interest of the Grantee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness.  Within 30 days after receiving the request for transfer, the City shall notify the Grantee in writing of any additional information it reasonably requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee.  If the City has not taken action on the Grantee’s request for transfer within 120 days after receiving such request, consent by the City shall be deemed given.

111.27 FCC CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS
Grantee shall adhere to the FCC Customer Service Obligations set forth in Section 76.309 of the FCC Rules and Regulations, made part of the agreement and on file at City Hall.

111.28 ADMINISTRATION

The Grantee agrees that the City, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Grantee, may review such of its books and records at the Grantee’s business office, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this franchise.  Such notice shall specifically reference the section of the franchise which is under review, so that the Grantee may organize the necessary books and records for easy access by the City.  Alternatively, if the books and records are not easily accessible at the local office of the Grantee, the Grantee may, at its sole option, choose to pay the reasonable travel costs of the City’s representative to view the books and records at the appropriate location.  The Grantee shall not be required to maintain any books and records for franchise compliance purposes longer than three years.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature, nor disclose books and records of any affiliate which is not providing cable service in the service area.  The City agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.  The Grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.

111.30 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
The Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the franchise, Commercial General Liability Insurance in the amount of $2,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage.  The City shall be designated as an additional insured.  Such insurance shall be non-cancellable except upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the City.  The Grantee shall provide a Certificate of Insurance showing evidence of the coverage required by this section.

111.31 INDEMNIFICATION
The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless and defend the City, its officers, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death) which arise out of the Grantee’s construction, operation or maintenance of its cable system, provided that the City shall give the Grantee written notice of its obligation to indemnify the City within 10 days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantee shall not indemnify the City for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or negligence of the City.

111.32 NOTICE OF VIOLATION
In the event that the City believes that the Grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, the City shall informally discuss the matter with Grantee.  If these discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem, the City shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance. 

111.33 GRANTEE’S RIGHT TO CURE OR RESPOND
The Grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice described in Section 111.32 to: (i) respond to the City contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or (ii) to cure such default; or (iii) in the event that, by the nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the City of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. 

111.34 PUBLIC HEARING
In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the notice as described in Section 111.32 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 111.33, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within 30 days or the date projected pursuant to Section 111.33(iii) above, if it intends to continue its investigation into the default, then the City shall schedule a public hearing.  The City shall provide the Grantee at least 10 days’ prior written notice of such hearing, which specifies the time, place and purpose of such hearing and provide the Grantee the opportunity to be heard.

111.35 ENFORCEMENT
Subject to applicable federal and State law, in the event the City, after the hearing set forth in 111.34, determines that the Grantee is in default of any provision of the franchise, the City may:

1.                   Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; or

2.                   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or

3.                   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the franchise, seek to revoke the franchise in accordance with Section 111.36.

111.36 REVOCATION
Should the City seek to revoke the franchise after following the procedures set forth in Sections 111.32 – 111.35, the City shall give written notice to the Grantee of its intent.  The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance.  The Grantee shall have 90 days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection.  In the event the City has not received a satisfactory response from the Grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public meeting.  The City shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least 30 days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its intent to revoke the franchise.  At the designated hearing, the City shall give the Grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked.  The Grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the City de novo.  Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within 60 days after the issuance of the determination of the City.  The City may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the City’s rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.

111.37 FORCE MAJEURE
The Grantee shall not be held in default under or in noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise or suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the Grantee to anticipate and control.  This provision includes work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their utility poles to which Grantee’s cable system is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary.  Furthermore, the parties hereby agree that it is not the City’s intention to subject the Grantee to penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of the franchise where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative impact on the subscriber within the service area, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and hardship to the Grantee which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the City and/or subscribers.

111.38 ACTIONS OF PARTIES
In any action by the City or the Grantee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner.  Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

B.                  “Public right-of-way” (PROW) means the area on, below, or above a public roadway, highway, street, cart way, bicycle lane, and public sidewalk in which the City has an interest, including other dedicated PROW for travel purposes and utility easements of the City.  A PROW does not include the airwaves above a PROW with regard to cellular or other non-wire telecommunications or broadcast service.

Persons planting or maintaining boulevard plantings or gardens shall not be deemed to burden or occupy the PROW, and shall not be required to obtain any license under this chapter.  However, nothing herein relieves a person from complying with the provisions of Iowa’s “One Call” law.  Additionally, nothing herein constitutes a grant of permission to permanently locate in the PROW, nor does the City waive any potential claims, counterclaims, crossclaims or interpleaders relative to persons putting plantings in the PROW that give rise to injuries or damage to others.  The City may at any time require the removal or relocation of plantings at the owner’s expense.

CHAPTER 160 FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT

160.01 STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE
1.                   The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare. 

2.                   Findings of Fact.

A.        The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community.

B.         These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by:  (i) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding; and (ii) the cumulative effect of obstructions on the flood plain causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

C.         This chapter relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Department of Natural Resources.

3.                   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in this chapter with provisions designed to:

A.                 Reserve sufficient flood plain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially.

B.                  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities.

C.                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement.

D.                 Protect individuals from buying lands that may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard.

E.                  Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.

160.14 APPOINTMENT AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
A Board of Adjustment is hereby established, which shall hear and decide:  (i) applications for conditional uses upon which the Board is authorized to pass under this chapter; (ii) appeals; and (iii) requests for variances to the provisions of this chapter, and shall take any other action which is required of the Board.

1.                   Conditional Uses.  Requests for conditional uses shall be submitted to the Administrator, who shall forward such to the Board of Adjustment for consideration.  Such requests shall include information ordinarily submitted with applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary to the Board of Adjustment.

2.                   Appeals.  Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this chapter, the aggrieved party may appeal such action.  The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board of Adjustment and with the official from whom the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the appeal.  The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.

3.                   Variances.  The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter which will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship.  Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards.

A.                 Prohibited.  No variance shall be granted for any development within the Floodway District which would result in any increase in floods during the occurrence of the 100 year flood.  Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be allowed for similarly situated lands.

B.                  Cause.  Variances shall only be granted upon:  (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public.

C.                  Required to Afford Relief.  Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

D.                 Notice to Applicant.  In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the Zoning Administrator that:  (i) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and (ii) such construction increases risks to life and property.

Department of Natural Resources Approval.  All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the Department of Natural Resources.

160.15 HEARINGS AND DECISIONS OF THE BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
1.                   Hearings.  Upon the filling with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal, an application for a conditional use or a request for a variance, the Board shall hold a public hearing.  The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to parties in interest.  At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney and present written or oral evidence.  The Board may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department of Natural Resources.

2.                   Decisions.  The Board shall arrive at a decision on an appeal, conditional use or variance within a reasonable time.  In passing upon an appeal, the Board may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and it shall make its decision, in writing, setting forth the findings of fact and the reasons for its decision.  In granting a conditional use or variance, the Board shall consider such factors as contained in this section and all other relevant sections of this chapter and may prescribe such conditions as contained in Section 160.17.

160.16 FACTORS UPON WHICH THE DECISION TO GRANT VARIANCES SHALL BE BASED
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and:

3.                   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.

4.                   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.

5.                   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the City.

6.                   The requirements of the facility for a flood plain location.

7.                   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use.

8.                   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.

9.                   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for the area.

10.               The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.

165.03 DISTRICTS AND GENERAL REGULATIONS
In order to classify, regulate and restrict the locations of trades, industries and the location of buildings designed for specified uses, to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or structurally altered, to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of the lot areas, and to regulate and determine the areas of yards, courts and other open spaces within and surrounding such buildings, the City is hereby divided into districts, of which there shall be nine in number, known as:

A                     Agricultural District

R-1                  Single-Family District

R-1A                Single-Family District

R-2                  Single- and Two-Family District

R-3                  Multiple Dwelling District

NC                   Neighborhood Commercial District

B-1                  Commercial District

B-2                  Business District

M-1                  Restricted Industrial District

M-2                  General Industrial District

For the purpose of interpretation, the A Agricultural District is the most restrictive district, with districts becoming progressively less restrictive as shown on the above list, with the M-2 General Industrial District being the least restrictive district.  Where reference to “more” or “less” restrictive districts is made in this chapter, interpretation shall be made in accordance with the above listing.

165.04 DISTRICT MAP
The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the map which is made a part of this chapter, which map is designated as the “District Map.”  The District Map and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon are a part of the Zoning Ordinance and have the same force and effect as if the District Map and all the notations, references and other information shown thereon where all fully set forth and described herein, the original of which District Map is properly attested and is on file with the Clerk.  

165.05 CLASSIFICATION
All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City shall be automatically classified in the A Agricultural District until otherwise changed by Ordinance, after public hearing.

165.06 VACATION OF ALLEY OR STREET
All streets, alleys, public ways, waterways and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets, public ways, or waterways and railroad rights-of-way.  Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, waterway or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline.

165.07 AMENDMENTS
Amendments, supplements or changes of the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map shall be made by an Ordinance amending the Zoning Ordinance.  The amending ordinance shall refer to the Official Zoning Map and shall set out the identification of the area affected by legal description and identify the zoning district as the same exists and the new district designation applicable to said property.  Said ordinance shall, after adoption and publication, be recorded by the City Clerk as other ordinances and a certified copy thereof be attached to the Official Zoning Map.  Such amendatory ordinance shall, however, not repeal, or reenact said map, but only amend it.  The Official Zoning Map, together with amending ordinances, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the City.  (See EDITOR’S NOTE at the end of this chapter for ordinances amending the Official Zoning Map.)

165.08 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of use, the Council may by resolution adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior map.  The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior map, and may graphically show changes to the original map made by amendatory ordinance, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment thereof in a manner not provided for within the ordinance.  The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by date and the signature of the Mayor attested by the Clerk, under the following words: “This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted as part of the zoning ordinance of the City.”

A.                 Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the keeping of domestic chickens and ducks shall be permitted on single-family residences and zero-lot line duplexes (where each unit owner owns a separate and distinct portion of the lot), so long as such keeping is in strict compliance with this subsection and all other applicable City ordinances unless, despite compliance with the following, the presence of any particular chickens and ducks endangers the health, safety, peace, quiet, comfort, enjoyment of, or otherwise becomes a public nuisance to nearby residents or occupants or places of business.

(1)        No person shall keep chickens and ducks inside a single-family dwelling unit, multi-family dwelling units or rental units.

(12)      The City shall not be liable for injury or death of chickens and ducks caused by dogs, cats, or other animals, domestic or wild, whether such animals are licensed by the City or not.  Further, injury or death of any chickens and ducks caused by an animal is not, in and of itself, sufficient grounds for the City to determine that the animal is a vicious animal pursuant to Chapter 56 of this Code of Ordinances.  Any dead chickens and ducks, not caused by slaughtering, shall be disposed of immediately upon discovering in a manner so as not to cause a nuisance pursuant to Chapter 50 of this Code of Ordinances.

(4)        Each chicken and duck shall be banded at all times.

(5)        By the granting of the permit to chickens and ducks and the application thereof, the permittee authorizes that the City or its agents have the right to go onto permittee’s property any time and without prior notice for the limited purpose of inspection of the premises to ensure that all applicable conditions have been met.

(6)        Within 30 days after the expiration of any permit, the permittee shall apply for and secure a renewal of the permit in the manner provided for in this chapter.  Failure to renew a permit within the time herein provided shall result in a delinquent fee, in addition to the regular permit fee, as set by the City Council.  All applicants shall be furnished with permit rules and regulations at the time the application is made.  Permit rules and regulations shall be approved by resolution of the City Council.

(7)        The permit is a limited license for the activity, and no vested zoning rights arise from the permit being issued.

(8)        The permit does not run with the land.  Private restrictions on the use of the property shall remain enforceable and shall supersede the permit.  The private restrictions include, but are not limited to, deed restrictions, condominium restrictions, neighborhood association bylaws, covenants and restrictions, and rental agreements.  A permit issued to a person whose property is subject to private restrictions that prohibit keeping chickens and ducks is void.

The applicant or holder of the permit will be given an opportunity for a hearing.  The decision of the City Administrator or any decision by the Clerk that is not appealed in accordance to this chapter shall be deemed final action.

(2)        When an application for a permit is denied or when a permit is revoked:

a.         The applicant may not re-apply for a new permit for a period of one year from the date of the denial or revocation unless the denial or revocation is due to administrative reasons only, as determined by the City Clerk.

b.         Chickens and ducks shall be removed immediately.

c.         Any coop, fowl house, fencing or other structures shall be removed within 10 days of the date of the permit being denied or revoked.

D.                 An owner or possessor of animals on property that is newly annexed has 90 days from the date of annexation to bring the property into compliance required by this section.

165.26 ADDITIONAL NONCONFORMING USES
1.                   Intent. It is the intent of this section to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures, or uses to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival.

A.                 It is recognized that there exist within the districts established by the ordinance codified in this chapter and subsequent amendments, lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before such ordinance was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments.

B.                  Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.  It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.

C.                  A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of the zoning ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by addition of other uses of a nature which would not be permitted generally in the district involved.

D.                 To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on.  Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, providing that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.

2.                   Nonconforming Uses of Land.  Where at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

A.                 No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.

B.                  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.

C.                  If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located.

3.                   Nonconforming Lot of Record.  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.  Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots of the same ownership.  This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.

4.                   Nonconforming Structures.  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

A.                 No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.  Such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which does not increase its nonconformity.

B.                  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement costs, exclusive of the foundation, it shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

C.                  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.

D.                 Discontinuance.  If building damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, or act of God is more than 50 percent, it shall be removed from said premises within 30 days following said damage.

5.                   Nonconforming Uses of Structures and Land.  Where a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not be permitted in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:

A.                 No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.

B.                  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.

C.                  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.

D.                 When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structures and land in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for a period of more than 12 months, the structure, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.

E.                  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.

F.                  A nonconforming lot of record which does not meet the required lot area or lot width requirements may be developed for a single-family dwelling so long as the required yard setbacks are maintained.

6.                   Repairs and Maintenance.  On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repairs or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing of the building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter shall not be increased.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety upon orders of such official.

7.                   Replacing Damaged Buildings.  Any nonconforming building or structure damaged more than 60 percent of its replacement value exclusive of the foundations at the time of damage by fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, or act of God shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as before such happening, but if less than 60 percent damage above the foundation, it may be restored, reconstructed, or used as before provided it be started within six months and finished in one year.  If the building damage is more than 60 percent, it shall be removed from said premises within 30 days following said damage.

8.                   Uses Under Exception Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses.  Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this ordinance shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further action, be deemed a conforming use in such district.  Any expansion shall be with approval of the Board of Adjustment.

9.                   Change of Tenancy or Ownership.  There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, of structures, or of structures and land in combination.

The administrative officer shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the administrative official certifies to the Board after notice of appeal shall have been filed with said official, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in the official’s opinion cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed unless otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application on notice to the administrative officer, and on due cause shown.

4.                   Fee for Appeal.  See Section 165.32 for schedule of fees.

8.                   Conditions for Special Exceptions.  The Board shall hear and decide only such other special exceptions as the Board is specifically authorized to pass on by the terms of this chapter, decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special exceptions should be granted, and grant special exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this chapter, or deny special exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter.  A special exception shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:

A.                 A written application for special exception is submitted indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested.

B.                  Notice of public hearing shall be given in advance of public hearing.  The owner of the property for which special exception is sought or an agent and any other affected property owners shall be notified by mail.

In granting any special exception, the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.  Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the special exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable under Section 165.35 of this chapter.  The Board may prescribe a time limit within which the action for which the special exception is required shall be begun or completed, or both.  Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time limit set shall void the special exception.

9.                   Powers - Variances.  The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship.  A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the Board unless and until:

A.                 A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating that:

(1)        Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved, and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.

(2)        Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter.

171.05 REFERRAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT
The Clerk shall immediately refer two copies of the preliminary plat to the City Engineer and seven copies to the Commission.  In the case of a subdivision outside the corporate limits of the City, the Clerk shall refer one copy of the preliminary plat to the County Board of Supervisors.

171.06 REVIEW OF PRELIMINARY PLAT
The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the Commission to determine its conformity with these regulations and all other ordinances and regulations in force affecting subdivisions. Copies of the preliminary plat may be transmitted to other City or school officials, as the Commission deems necessary, for their recommendations concerning matters within their jurisdiction.  Their recommendations, along with those of the City Engineer, shall be transmitted to the Commission within three weeks from the date the plat is filed.  The Commission may confer with the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of such improvements to be made.

171.07 ACTION BY THE COMMISSION ON PRELIMINARY PLAT
The Commission shall, as soon as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter, pass upon the preliminary plat as originally submitted or modified.  If the Commission does not act within 30 days, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be approved; provided, however, that the subdivider may agree to an extension of the time period not to exceed an additional 60 days.  It shall then set forth its recommendations in writing, whether of approval, modification or disapproval.

1.                   Reasons for Changes or Disapproval.  In the event that substantial changes or modifications are made by the Commission or the Commission recommends disapproval of the plat, it shall give its reasons therefor and it may request and cause the revised preliminary plat to be resubmitted in the same manner as the original plat.

2.                   Tentative Approval.  If the Commission recommends approval, it shall express its approval as “tentative approval” and state the conditions of such approval, if any.

3.                   Documenting Approval.  The action of the Commission shall be documented on nine copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined.  One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy shall be retained by the Commission, and seven copies shall be referred to the Council.

171.08 ACTION BY THE COUNCIL ON PRELIMINARY PLAT
1.                   Within 30 days of the receipt of the preliminary plat, the Council shall, by resolution, tentatively approve or disapprove the plat.  If the preliminary plat is disapproved, objections to it shall be returned to the Commission for further review and the Clerk shall notify the subdivider of such action.  If approved, the Clerk shall sign five copies of the preliminary plat with the notation of the date the preliminary plat received the Council’s tentative approval.  One copy shall be returned to the Commission and three copies shall be returned to the subdivider.  The tentative approval by the Council shall not constitute final acceptance of the addition or subdivision by the City but an authorization to proceed with preparation of the final plat.

2.                   The Council may, upon request of the subdivider, decide to construct certain improvements itself as part of its tentative approval which improvements shall fulfill the requirements in other sections of these subdivision regulations, only as follows:

A.                 The City may construct water mains and fire hydrants or sewer mains, which costs to the City shall be recovered by connection fees.  Such rates must be established by ordinance of the Council.

(Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.84[2a])

B.                  The City may construct sanitary sewers or water mains under special assessment, which assessment, upon request of the owner, shall not become payable until such time as the property is not used as agricultural property under Section 384.62 of the Code of Iowa.

C.                  The City may allow the applicant to construct street bases without concrete surfacing if it determines that the City will surface the streets later under other City programs.

171.09 EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF TENTATIVE APPROVAL
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year, at the end of which time final approval must have been obtained.  Any plat not receiving final approval within this period of time shall be void, and the subdivider shall be required to resubmit a new plat for tentative approval subject to all new zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations.

171.10 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
Before the Council will approve the final plat, all of the required improvements shall be constructed and accepted by formal resolution of the Council.  Before passage of said resolution of acceptance, the City Engineer shall report that said improvements meet all City specifications and ordinances or other City requirements, and the agreements between the subdivider and the City.


171.11 PERFORMANCE BOND
The completion requirement for improvements may be waived in whole or in part if the subdivider will post a performance bond with the Council guaranteeing that improvements not completed will be constructed within a period of one year from final acceptance of the plat; but final acceptance of the plat will not constitute final acceptance by the City of any improvements to be constructed.  Improvements will be accepted only after their construction has been completed.  Such performance bond shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution.  Upon recommendation of the Commission, the Council may extend the completion date set forth in the bond for a maximum period of one additional year.

171.12 FINAL PLAT
The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.

171.13 REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL PLAT
The following graphic and descriptive material is required to be provided on the final plat and in the accompanying material.

1.                   Contents of the Final Plats.  Every plat of a subdivision offered for record shall conform to the provisions of Sections 355.8 and 354.6 of the Code of Iowa.

B.                  A certificate by the City Engineer that all required improvements and installations have been completed according to the construction plans submitted with the preliminary plat, or that a performance bond guaranteeing completion has been approved by the City Attorney and filed with the Clerk or that the Council has agreed that the City will provide the necessary improvements and installations and assess the costs against the subdivider or future property owners in the subdivision, or an agreement that improvements will be constructed in accordance with Section 171.08(2) of this chapter.

C.                  A statement of restrictions of all types that run with the land and become covenants in the deeds of lots.

171.14 SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAT
The subdivider shall prepare a final plat in accordance with the provisions of Section 171.13 and shall file with the Clerk an application in triplicate for the final approval of the plat.  The application shall:

171.16 ACTION BY THE COMMISSION ON FINAL PLAT
The Commission shall, upon receiving the final plat, as soon as possible, but not more than 30 days thereafter, consider the final plat, and if the same is recommended for approval, shall submit its recommendation of approval to the Council together with a certified copy of its resolution showing the action of the Commission.  If the Commission recommends approval of the final plat, such approval and the date thereof shall be noted on the plat over the signatures of both the Chairperson and Secretary of the Commission, and the plat and seven copies shall be transmitted to the Council, and one copy shall be returned to the subdivider.

171.17 ACTION BY THE COUNCIL ON FINAL PLAT
Upon receipt of the certification by the Commission, the Council shall, within 60 days, either approve or disapprove the final plat.

1.                   Disapproval of Plat.  In the event that said plat is disapproved by the Council, such disapproval shall be expressed in writing and shall point out wherein said proposed plat is objectionable.

2.                   Acceptance of Plat.  In the event that said plat is found to be acceptable and in accordance with these regulations, the Council shall accept same.

3.                   Final Approval and Recording of Plat.  The passage of a resolution by the Council accepting the plat shall constitute final approval of the platting of the area shown on the final plat, but the subdivider or owner shall cause such plat to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder and shall file satisfactory evidence of such recording in the office of the Clerk before the City shall recognize the plat as being in full force and effect.

171.18 RESUBDIVISION OF LAND
The following requirements shall govern the resubdivision of land.

1.                   Procedure for Resubdivision.  For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved for public use indicated on the map, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan legally established prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions, such parcel shall be approved by the same procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision.

2.                   Acreage Lots.  Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the Commission and Council may require that such parcel of land allow for future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets.  Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat.

CHAPTER 172 SUBDIVISION CONTROL – IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS

172.01 COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS
Before the final plat is approved by the Council, all applicants shall be required to complete, in accordance with the Council’s decision and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, all the street, sanitary, and other improvements as required in these regulations, specified in the preliminary plat, and as approved by the Council, and to dedicate same to the City, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated .

172.02 PERFORMANCE BOND
The Council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approving the final plat, and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of application for final plat approval in an amount estimated by the Council as sufficient to secure to the City the satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication of the incomplete portion of required improvements. In addition:

1.                   Approved by City Attorney.  Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations.

2.                   Completion Period.  The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be specified by the Council in the resolution approving the final plat shall be incorporated in the bond, and shall not exceed one year from date of final approval.

3.                   Extension of Completion Period.  The performance bond shall be approved by the Council as to the amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the Council.  The Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the Council extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year.  The Council may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond.

4.                   Temporary Improvements.  The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the Council and shall maintain same for the period specified by the Council.  Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed.

5.                   Failure to Complete Improvement.  For subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period specified by the Council in the resolution approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to have expired.  In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond, the City may declare the bond to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default.

172.03 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS
The Council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during construction and insure their satisfactory completion.  The applicant shall pay to the City an inspection fee equal to the actual cost of inspection.  These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid.  The subdivider shall furnish the Council with a construction schedule prior to the commencement of any and all construction, and notify the City not less than 24 hours in advance of readiness for required inspections.

172.04 RELEASE OR REDUCTION OF PERFORMANCE BOND
The performance bond may not be released or reduced except as follows:

1.                   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion.  The Council will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce a performance bond, until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicant’s engineer has certified to the City through submission of detailed “as-built” plans of the subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the City, that all public improvements are in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision.

2.                   Reduction of Performance Bond.  A performance bond may be reduced upon actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the plat.


172.05 MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS
Improvements shall be maintained and a maintenance bond provided as follows:

1.                   Maintenance of Improvements Before Acceptance.  The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements on the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of said improvements by the Council.  If there are any certificates of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City, the City may, on 12 hours’ notice, plow the street or effect emergency repairs and charge same to applicant.

2.                   Maintenance Bond.  The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with the governing body, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the Council and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of two years after the date of their acceptance by the governing body and dedication of same to the local government.

172.06 DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Required improvements may be deferred or waived as follows:

1.                   Waiver of Required Improvements.  The Council may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such improvements as in its judgment are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.

2.                   Deferral of Required Improvements.  Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Council to defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the applicant shall pay a share of the costs of the future improvements to the City prior to the approval of the final plat, or the applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said improvements upon demand of the City.

172.07 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the extent of street improvement is adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment.

172.08 IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED
The subdivider shall install and construct all improvements required by these regulations in accordance with the specifications and under the supervision of the Council and to its satisfaction.

172.12 MONUMENTATION
Monuments shall be in conformance with the following requirements:

1.                   Establishment of Permanent Control Monuments.  Prior to the offering of the plat of any subdivision for record, the surveyor shall confirm the prior establishment of permanent control monuments at each controlling corner on the boundaries of the parcel or tract of land being subdivided.  If no permanent control monuments exist, the surveyor shall establish at least two permanent control monuments for each block created, or if the area subdivided into lots is less than a block in size, at least two permanent control monuments shall be established for the subdivision.  Permanent control monuments shall be constructed of reasonably permanent material solidly embedded in the ground and capable of being detected by commonly used magnetic or electronic equipment.  The surveyor shall affix a cap of reasonably inert material bearing an embossed or stencil cut marking of the Iowa registration number of the surveyor to the top of the monument.

2.                   Other Monuments of Record.  Other monuments established prior to the recording of the plat of the subdivision and described on the plat shall be considered monuments of record and shall be given the same weight as original permanent control monuments if the monuments remain undisturbed in their original positions.  The additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in subsection 1 of this section.

3.                   Establishment and Recording of Other Monuments.  Monuments other than the permanent control monuments required in subsection 1 of this section shall not be required to be established before the recording of the plat or the conveyancing of lands by reference to the plat if the surveyor includes in the certification of the plat that the additional monuments required by these regulations shall be established before a specified future date.

4.                   Additional Monuments Required.  Additional monuments shall be constructed and embedded according to the provisions for permanent control monuments prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, and shall be set at all of the following locations whether set prior to the recording of the plat, or subsequent to such recording:

A.                 At every corner and angle point of every lot, block or parcel of land created.

C.                  At every point of curve, tangency, reversed curve, or compounded curve on every right-of-way line established.

Placement of Monument.  When the placement of a monument required by this chapter at the prescribed location is impractical, it is permissible to establish a reference monument in close proximity to the prescribed location.  If the reference monument is established prior to the recording of the plat and its location properly shown on the plat, the reference monument shall have the same status as other monuments of record.  Where any point requiring monumentation has been previously monumented, the existence of the monument shall be confirmed by the surveyor.  The existing monument shall be considered a monument of record when properly shown and described on the recorded plat. 

172.13 CHARACTER OF THE LAND
Land which the City finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision or its surrounding areas or both, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the subdivider and approved by the Council, upon recommendation of the Commission, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions.  Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger.

172.14 LOTS

Specific standards are contained in the design standards of these regulations.

B.                  All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of streets and dedicated right-of-way.

C.                  All arterials shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses.

D.                 Municipal service streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.

E.                  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Council such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.

F.                  In business and industrial developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.

4.                   Access to State or County Jurisdictional Roads.  Whenever any part of a subdivision is designed with access to a road under State or County jurisdiction, permission for access to such roads shall be obtained from the appropriate jurisdiction and such access shall be designed according to the standards of the appropriate jurisdiction.

5.                   Access to Arterial Streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Council may require that lot access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:

A.                 Lots shall be designed so as to back onto the primary arterial and front onto a parallel municipal service street; no access shall be provided from the arterial street, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots.

B.                  A series of culs-de-sac entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial street.

C.                  A frontage or service road, separated from the primary arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable points.

6.                   Street Names.  Streets that are in alignment with others already existing shall bear the name of the existing streets.  The proposed names of new streets shall not duplicate or sound similar to existing street names.  Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Council and Commission.

7.                   Street Name Signs.  Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be approved by the Council.  The City shall install all street name signs.  The applicant shall deposit with the City at the time of final subdivision approval, the estimated cost of installation of each street sign required by the Council.

8.                   Street Lights.  Installation of street lights shall be required in accordance with design and specification standards approved by the Council.

9.                   Construction of Streets and Dead-End Streets.  Streets and dead-end streets shall be in conformance with the following requirements:

A.                 Construction of Streets.  The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, and for efficient provision of utilities.  If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line.  A temporary T- or L-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutters whenever the street is continued.  The Council may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.

B.                  Permanent Dead-End Streets.  Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Council for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 150 feet.  However, the Council may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities.  A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with City construction standards and specifications.  For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.

172.17 STREETS, DESIGN STANDARDS
The following design standards shall apply to the design of streets:

1.                   General.  In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, fire fighting, snow removal, sanitation, and street maintenance equipment, and to coordinate streets so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties the following design standards for streets are hereby required:

A.                 A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on municipal arterial and municipal collector streets, and 75 feet on municipal service streets.

B.                  When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than 10 degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for municipal service and municipal collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Council shall determine for special cases.

C.                  Minimum Roadway and Right-of-Way Standards:

(1)        Municipal arterial streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less than 80 feet and a roadway width of not less than 44 feet.

(2)        Municipal collector streets shall have a right-of-way width of not less than 60 feet and a roadway width (back-to-back including curb and gutter width) of not less than 36 feet in commercial or industrial areas, and 29 feet in fringe or residential areas.

(3)        Municipal service streets shall have a right-of-way of not less than 50 feet and a roadway width of not less than 26 feet.

All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications adopted by the City, and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat approval.

3.                   Excess Right-of-Way.  Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes.  Such slopes shall not be in excess of three to one.

4.                   Railroads and Limited Access Highways.  Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:

A.                 In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.  This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat:  This strip is reserved for screening.  The placement of structures hereon is prohibited.

B.                  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.

C.                  Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way.  Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.

A.                 Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles.  A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable.  An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom.  Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the Council.

B.                  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street.  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection.  Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.  Intersection of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.

C.                  Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two municipal service streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a municipal collector street shall be at least 25 feet.  Abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement.

D.                 Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical.  In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.

E.                  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.

F.                  The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be three percent or less.

6.                   Bridges.  Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined by the Council, shall be constructed at the full expense of the applicant without reimbursement from the City.  The sharing expense for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined by the Council, will be fixed by special agreement between the Council and the applicant.  Said cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the percentage of land developed and so served.

7.                   Alleys.  The following design standards for alleys shall be required of all subdividers:

A.                 Alleys shall be prohibited in residential districts.

B.                  Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that the Planning Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.

C.                  Alleys shall have a right-of-way of not less than thirty 30 feet and a roadway width of not less than 20 feet.

D.                 Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement.

E.                  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end, as determined by the Council.

8.                   Street Dedications and Reservations.  The following provisions shall apply to street dedications and reservations:

A.                 Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets.  Where an existing half street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider.  The Council may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within the subdivision boundaries.

B.           Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow street or when City plans or zoning setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve and dedicate at the applicant’s own expense such areas for widening or realignment of such roads.  Such frontage roads and streets shall be improved and dedicated by the applicant at the applicant’s expense to the full width as required by these subdivision regulations.  Land reserved for any street purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the zoning regulations whether the land is to be dedicated to the City in fee simple or an easement is granted to the City.
