All general ordinances of the Village passed prior to the adoption of this Village Code are hereby
repealed, except such as are included in this Village Code or are by necessary implication herein
reserved from repeal (subject to the saving clauses contained in the following sections), and excluding
the following ordinances which are not hereby repealed: tax levy ordinances; appropriation ordinances;

No ordinance relating to railroads or railroad crossings with streets and other public ways, or relating to
the conduct, duties, service or rates of public utilities shall be replaced by virtue of the preceding

Village Code shall be considered as amending such ordinance or ordinances in respect to such
provisions only.
§ 1-2-3. Court proceedings.
[1983 Code]
No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance, whether such former
ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense committed against such former
ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right
accrued or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such
offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred or any
right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes effect, save only that proceedings
thereafter shall conform to the ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as
practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new
ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied to any judgment
announced after the new ordinance takes effect.
This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or implication, whether the repeal
is in the ordinance making any new provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as abating any action now pending under or
by virtue of any general ordinance of the Village herein repealed and the provisions of all general
ordinances contained in this Code shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new
enactment of the same provision; nor shall this chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person,
firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the Village under any ordinance or provisions thereof
in force at the time of the adoption of this Village Code.

[12-18-2007]
It is the policy of the Village of Thornton to allow free and open audio and video taping of its public

not disruptive to the meeting and the deliberative process, and to protect the rights of meeting
attendees, the Village Board enacts the following guidelines:
All individuals wishing to audio or video tape public hearings shall notify the Clerk before the
meeting of their intent to tape the meeting. Prior to the start of the meeting, the Clerk is to
announce to everyone in attendance that the proceedings are being recorded.
All audio and video taping activities must be open. Using hidden devices to audio or video
tape public meetings is prohibited.
All equipment, such as tripods, lights, cables and other such equipment, shall be set up
before the meeting and taken down after adjournment so as not to disrupt the proceedings.
Individuals engaged in audio or video taping shall not block the view or otherwise interfere
with the other members of the audience, and are requested to stand or sit in the back of the
room if they anticipate blocking the view of other audience members.
Audio or videotaping should not be disruptive to the meeting and the deliberative process.
Examples of disruptions are: using equipment that produces distracting sound or light
emissions; conducting interviews or reporting in the meeting room during the meeting. This is
not intended to prevent photography.
All individuals engaged in audio or video taping public Village meetings shall comply with all
other applicable laws regarding taping or use of information.
Individuals choosing to disregard the rules will be asked to leave the meeting.
Audio or videotaping will not be allowed during executive sessions, except where required by
law.

defined in § 1-9-3 alleging a violation of any section of the Village Ethics Code or Conduct Code.
Such complaint must be filed with the Ethics Commission within 45 days after the alleged violation
took place.
Within three business days after the receipt of a complaint, the Commission shall send by certified
mail, return receipt requested, a notice to the respondent that a complaint has been filed against
him or her and a copy of the complaint. The Commission shall send by certified mail, return receipt
requested, a confirmation of the receipt of the complaint to the complainant within three business
days after receipt by the Commission. The notices to the respondent and the complainant shall
also advise them of the date, time, and place of the meeting to determine the sufficiency of the
complaint and to establish whether probable cause exists to proceed.
Upon not less than 48 hours' public notice, the Commission shall meet to review the sufficiency of
the complaint and, if the complaint is deemed sufficient to allege a violation of this chapter, to
determine whether there is probable cause, based on the evidence presented by the complainant,
to proceed. The meeting may be closed to the public to the extent authorized by the Open
Meetings Act. The Commission shall issue notice to the complainant and the respondent of the
Commission's ruling on the sufficiency of the complaint and, if necessary, on probable cause to
proceed within seven business days after receiving the complaint.
If the complaint is deemed sufficient to allege a violation of the Village Code of Ethics or Code of
Conduct and there is a determination of probable cause, then the Commission's notice to the
parties shall include a hearing date schedule within four weeks after the complaint's receipt.
Alternatively, the Commission may elect to notify in writing the attorney designated by the
corporate authorities to prosecute such actions and request that the complaint be adjudicated
judicially. If the complaint is deemed not sufficient to allege a violation or if there is no
determination of probable cause, then the Commission shall send by certified mail, return receipt
requested, a notice to the parties of the decision to dismiss the complaint, and that notice shall be
made public.
On the scheduled date and upon at least 48 hours' public notice of the meeting, the Commission
shall conduct a hearing on the complaint and shall allow both parties the opportunity to present
testimony and evidence. The hearing may be closed to the public only if authorized by the Open
Meetings Act.
Within 30 days after the date the hearing or any recessed hearing is concluded, the Commission
shall either (i) dismiss the complaint or (ii) issue a recommendation for discipline to the alleged
violator and to the Mayor, or impose a fine upon the violator, or both. The particular findings in the
case, any recommendation for discipline, and any fine imposed shall be a matter of public
information.
If the hearing was closed to the public, the respondent may file a written demand for a public
hearing on the complaint within seven business days after the issuance of the recommendation for
discipline or imposition of a fine, or both. The filing of the demand shall stay the enforcement of
the recommendation or fine. Within 14 days after receiving the demand, the Commission shall
conduct a public hearing on the complaint upon at least 48 hours' public notice of the hearing and
allow both parties the opportunity to present testimony and evidence. Within seven days
thereafter, the Commission shall publicly issue a final recommendation to the alleged violator and
to the Mayor or impose a fine upon the violator or both.
If a complaint is filed during the 60 preceding the date of any election at which the respondent is a
candidate, the Commission shall render its decision as required under Subsection E within seven
days after the complaint is filed, and during the seven days preceding that election, the
Commission shall render such decision before the date of that election, if possible.
Each complaint must be typewritten and filed in triplicate with the Village with a copy also served
on the alleged violator; provided, however, in order to prevent an abuse of this procedure during
any municipal election, no such complaint may be filed within 30 days before any municipal

§ 1-10-9. Confidentiality.
[2-6-2006]
Complaints to the Commission and investigations and recommendations thereon shall be confidential,
except as necessary to carry out powers and duties of the Commission or to enable another person or
agency to consider and act upon the notices and recommendations of the Commission; provided that,
without identifying the person complained against or the specific transaction, the Commission may (a)
comment publicly on the disposition of its requests and recommendations and (b) publish summary
opinions to inform Village personnel and the public about the interpretation of provisions of this
chapter.
§ 1-10-10. Penalties.
[2-6-2006]
The Commission may fine any person who intentionally violates any provision of the Village Ethics
Code or Conduct Code an amount of not more than $1,000. The Commission may fine any person
who knowingly files a frivolous complaint alleging a violation of the Village Ethics Code or Conduct
Code, or who repeatedly files complaints in an attempt to harass, annoy or intimidate, an amount
not more than $1,000. The Commission may also recommend to the Village Board any
appropriate discipline up to and including discharge.
If a Village official is found to be in violation of the Village Ethics Code or Conduct Code by the
Ethics Commission, and the Ethics Commission determines that such may also be a violation of
state law, all documents, testimony, depositions, and all other pertinent information to the case
shall be immediately forwarded to the Cook County State's Attorney or Illinois Attorney General as
appropriate for review and potential prosecution.
In addition to any other penalty that may be applicable, whether criminal or civil, an officer or

A. The Village of Thornton Board recognizes the need for decision-making and public
responsiveness, which requires a commitment to ethical, business-like and lawful conduct
including proper use of authority and appropriate decorum when acting as a Board member.
Accordingly, each Board member will:
Represent all the people of the community while avoiding partisanship based on special
interests.
Engage in no self-dealing or the conduct of any private business of personal services
between any Board member and the organization except as procedurally controlled to assure
openness, competitive opportunity and abuse of "inside" information.
Limit yourself in the participation of the discussions and recuse in voting on those items that
are an unavoidable conflict of interest.
Not promise in advance of a meeting how he or she will vote on any issue, should reserve
judgment until all facts have been presented.
Not use his or her position to obtain employment for him- or herself, for immediate family
members or close associates. (Should a member desire employment, he or she must first
resign.)

Respect the Board's commitment to work with the administrator by:
Request desired information about the Village's programs directly from him or her;
Utilize his or her suggestions for new policies;
Seek his or her professional advice;
Refrain from acting on any complaint until after the administrator has had an opportunity
to investigate fully and report to the Board; and
Respect Board-approved actions of the administrator and his or her staff.

operations and shall speak or act for the Board only when specifically authorized to do so by
action of the Board.
Understand and respect the separation of Board responsibilities and functions from those of
the Administrator and staff. The Board's responsibility is to ensure that the agency is well
managed — not to manage the Village.
Consider unethical and thus avoid "secret" sessions of the Board.
Respect the confidentiality appropriate to issues of a sensitive nature.
Commit to prompt and regular attendance at Board meetings and be properly prepared for
Board deliberation.
Understand and follow all provisions of the Illinois Open Meetings Act, as well as any other

The Village of Thornton.
§ 1-12-4. Findings.
[10-19-2009]
The Village is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR 681.2 due to its provision or maintenance of covered
accounts for which payment is made in arrears.
Covered accounts offered to customers for the provisions of Village services include water and
sewer.
The Village's previous experience with identity theft related to covered accounts is as follows:
None.
The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account and
making payments on such accounts have been identified as potential processes in which identity
theft could occur.
The Village limits access to personal identifying information to those employees responsible for or
otherwise involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or accepting payment for use of
covered accounts. Information provided to such employees is entered directly into the Village's
computer system and is not otherwise recorded.
The Village determines that there is a low risk of identity theft occurring in the following ways (if
any):
Use by an applicant of another person's personal identifying information to establish a new
covered account;
Use of a previous customer's personal identifying information by another person in an effort to
have service restored in the previous customer's name;

§ 1-12-5. Process of establishing a covered account.
[10-19-2009]
As a precondition to opening a covered account in the Village, each applicant shall provide the
Village with personal identifying information of the customer which shall include a valid
government issued identification card containing a photograph of the customer or, for customers
who are not natural persons, a photograph of the customer's agent opening the account. Such
applicant shall also provide any information necessary for the department providing the service for
which the covered account is created to access the applicant's consumer credit report. Such
information shall be entered directly into the Village's computer system and shall not otherwise be
recorded.
Each account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN)
which shall be unique to that account. The Village may utilize computer software to randomly
generate assigned PINs and to encrypt account numbers and PINs.
§ 1-12-6. Access to covered account information.
[10-19-2009]
Access to customer accounts shall be password protected and shall be limited to authorized
Village personnel.
Such password(s) shall be changed by the director of the department providing the service for
which the covered account is created, on a regular basis, shall be at least eight characters in
length and shall contain letters, numbers and symbols.
Any unauthorized access to or other breach of customer accounts is to be reported immediately to
the Village Administrator and the password changed immediately.
Personal identifying information included in customer accounts is considered confidential and any
request or demand for such information shall be immediately forwarded to the Village
Administrator and the Village Attorney.
§ 1-12-7. Credit card payments.
[10-19-2009]
In the event that credit card payments that are made over the Internet are processed through a
third party service provider, such third-party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate
identity theft prevention program in place that is applicable to such payments.
All credit card payments made over the telephone or the Village's website shall be entered directly
into the customer's account information in the computer data base.
Account statements and receipts for covered accounts shall include only the last four digits of the
credit or debit card or the bank account used for payment of the covered account.

relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt collector prior to the discovery
of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such account;
Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the
customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying
information; or
Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.
In the event that any Village employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered
account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to an application
for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red
flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such
employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such
employee shall immediately report such red flags to the Village Administrator. If, in his or her
discretion, such employee deems that identity is unlikely or that reliable information is available to
reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the Village Administrator, who

the Village is accurate, the Village is required to provide such address to the consumer
reporting agency from which the Village received a notice of address discrepancy with respect
to such consumer. This information is required to be provided to the consumer reporting
agency when:

Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed,
remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under
the Illinois Administrative Review Law are a debt due and owing the municipality and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law.
After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law
may be sought for a final determination of a Code violation, unless stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the findings, decision, and order of the hearing officer may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment ordering a defendant to
correct a Code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a Code violation, any
expenses incurred by a municipality to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to,
attorney's fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are
fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a hearing officer, shall be a debt due and owing the
municipality and may be collected in accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being
fixed by a hearing officer pursuant to this Subsection C, the municipality shall provide notice to the
defendant that states that the defendant shall appear at a hearing before the administrative
hearing officer to determine whether the defendant has failed to comply with the judgment. The
notice shall set the date for such a hearing, which shall not be less than seven days from the date
that notice is served. If notice is served by mail, the seven-day period shall begin to run on the
date that the notice was deposited in the mail.

Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or both,
of the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owing the municipality under this section.
The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction. A hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default
and set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed within 21 days after the issuance of the order of
default, if the hearing officer determines that the petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was
for good cause or at any time if the petitioner establishes that the municipality did not provide
proper service of process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this Subsection E, the hearing
officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for
any debt due and owing the municipality as a result of the vacated default judgment.

telecommunications retailers subject to this article to determine whether the telecommunications
retailer has properly accounted to the Village for the Village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any
underpayment of the amount of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the Village plus 5% of the total amount of the

Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the tax shall not be imposed if and to the
extent that imposition or collection of the tax would violate the Constitution or statutes of the
United States or the Constitution of the State of Illinois.
The tax shall be imposed with respect to the use or consumption of electricity by residential
customers beginning with the first bill issued on or after September 1, 1998; and with respect
to the use or consumption of electricity by nonresidential customers beginning with the first bill

1, 2001, whichever issuance occurs sooner.
Collection of Tax.
Subject to the provisions of Subsection A regarding the delivery of electricity to resellers, the
tax imposed under this article shall be collected from purchasers by the person maintaining a
place of business in this state who delivers electricity to such purchasers. This tax shall
constitute a debt of the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser
and is recoverable at the same time and in the same manner as the original charge for
delivering the electricity.
Any tax required to be collected by this article, and any tax in fact collected, shall constitute a
debt owned to the Village by the person delivering the electricity; provided, that the person
delivering electricity shall be allowed credit for such tax related to deliveries of electricity, the
charges of which are written off as uncollectible; and provided, further, that if such charges
are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax.
Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the
gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be
authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to 3% of the tax they collect to
reimburse them for their expenses incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing
and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the Village upon request. For
purposes of this article, any partial payment of a billed amount not specifically identified by the
purchaser shall be deemed to be for the delivery of electricity.
Tax Remittance and Return.
Every tax collector shall on a monthly basis file a return in a form prescribed by the Village
Clerk. The return and accompanying remittance shall be due on or before the last day of the
month following the month which the tax is collected or is required to be collected under
Subsection B of this section.
If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser or is excused from
collecting the tax under Subsection B of this section, then the purchaser shall file a return in a
form prescribed by the Village Treasurer (Treasurer) and pay the tax directly to the Treasurer
on or before the last day of the month following the month during which the electricity is used
or consumed.
Resales.
Electricity that is delivered to a person in this Village shall be considered to be for use and
consumption by that person unless the person receiving the electricity has an active resale
number issued by the Treasurer and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the
electricity, and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially non-taxable as
a sale for resale.
If a person who receives electricity in the Village claims to be an authorized reseller of
electricity, that person shall apply to Treasurer for a resale number. The applicant shall state
facts showing why it is not liable for the tax imposed by this article on any purchases of

require.
Upon approval of the applicant, the Treasurer shall assign a resale number to the applicant
and shall certify the number to the applicant.
The Treasurer may cancel the resale number of any person if the person fails to pay any tax
payable under this article for electricity used or consumed by the person, or if the number: (1)
was obtained through misrepresentation, or (2) is no longer necessary because the person
has discontinued making resales.
Partial resale; delivery to reseller:
If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and partly for resale,
the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this article directly to the Treasurer pursuant to
Subsection B on the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall
collect the tax pursuant to Subsection B and remit the tax pursuant to Subsection B1 on
the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a purchaser.
Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active resale number and
complying with all other conditions of this article shall be excused from collecting the
remitting tax on any portion of the electricity delivered to the reseller, provided that the
person reports to the Treasurer the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller,

requested by the taxpayer within 30 days after the originally designated audit and during
normal business hours.
The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit conducted. The audit shall
be conducted not less than seven days nor more than 30 days from the date the notice is
given, unless the taxpayer and the local tax administrator agreed to some other convenient
time. In the event taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the

to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.
Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's business or activities,
including original source documents and books of entry denoting the transactions which had

It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available its books and records for
inspection by the Village. If the taxpayer or tax collector fails to provide the documents
necessary for audit within the time provided, the local tax administrator may issue a tax
determination and assessment based on the tax administrator's determination of the best
estimate of the taxpayer's tax liability.
If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally imposed and administered
tax as a result of the audit, written notice of the amount of overpayment shall be given to the
taxpayer within 30 days of the Village's determination of the amount of overpayment.

protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any
continuance granted shall not exceed 14 days.
At the hearing the local tax administrator shall preside and shall hear testimony and accept any
evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit or assessment. The strict rules of evidence
applicable to judicial proceedings shall not apply.

of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the Village issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice
of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due
for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or
payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.

[1-2-2001]
The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the
controlling tax ordinance. The local tax administrator may not cancel any installment contract so
entered unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the local
tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer shall have 14 working days to
cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen-day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator, the
installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the taxpayer.
§ 4-3D-14. Statute of limitations.
[1-2-2001]
The Village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely
manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days
after receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four years after the end of
the calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was due, whichever occurs
later.
If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period for which a notice of tax
determination or assessment may be issued by the Village, the tax paid was less than 75% of
the tax due, the statute of limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar
year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the
return for the applicable period was filed.
No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax return was filed by the taxpayer.
§ 4-3D-15. Voluntary disclosure.
[1-2-2001]
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of
an audit, investigation or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an
application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a
voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per
month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any
additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if
the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the
result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and
void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local administrator. However, any
additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
article must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the
additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

force from and after the signing of a franchise agreement by the Village, as provided by law, and shall
continue in force and effect for an initial term of no longer than 12 years, provided that within 15 days
after the date of Village approval of the franchise the Grantee shall file with the Village its unconditional
acceptance of the franchise and promise to comply with and abide by all its provisions, terms and
conditions. Such acceptance and promise shall be in writing duly executed and sworn to, by, or on
behalf of the Grantee before a notary public or other officer authorized by law to administer oaths.
Such franchise shall be nonexclusive and revokable.
§ 5-6C-7. Franchise renewal.
[12-28-1998]
Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 546, the following procedure shall apply:
The Village may, on its own initiative, during the six-month period which begins with the thirty-sixmonth
before the franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the public in the
Village appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of (1) identifying the future cablerelated
community needs and interests and (2) reviewing the performance of the Grantee under
the franchise. If the Grantee submits, during such six-month period, a written renewal notice
requesting the commencement of such proceeding, the Village shall commence such proceeding
not later than six months after the date such notice is submitted.
Upon completion of the proceeding under Subsection A above, the Grantee may, on its own
initiative or at the request of the Village, submit a proposal for renewal. The Village may establish
a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.
Upon submittal by the Grantee of a proposal to the Village for the renewal of the franchise, the
Village shall provide prompt, public notice of such proposal and renew the franchise or issue a
preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed, and at the request of the
Grantee or on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding, after providing prompt,
public notice of such proceeding.
The Village shall consider in any administrative proceeding whether: (1) the Grantee has
substantially complied with material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law; (2) the
quality of the Grantee's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints and
billing practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services
provided over the System, has been reasonable in the light of community needs; (3) the Grantee
has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities and equipment as set
forth in the Grantee's proposal; and (4) the Grantee's proposal is reasonable to meet the future

cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the costs of meeting such needs
and interests.
In any proceeding under Subsection D, the Grantee shall be afforded adequate notice and the
Grantee and the Village, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation,
including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the
proceedings under Subsection A above), to require the production of evidence and to question
witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding.
At the completion of a proceeding under Subsection D, the Village shall issue a written decision
granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding and
transmit a copy of such decision to the Grantee. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.
Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with the procedures
set forth above, shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors
described at Subsection D(1) through (4) pursuant to the record of the proceeding under said
subsection. The Village may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with
the material terms of the franchise or on events considered under Subsection D(2) unless the
Village has provided the Grantee with notice and the opportunity to cure or in any case in which it
is documented that the Village has waived its right to object.
The Grantee may appeal any final decision or failure of the Village to act in accordance with the
procedural requirements of this section. The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds
that (1) any action of the Village is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this
section; or (2) in the event of a final decision of the Village denying the renewal proposal, the
Grantee has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the Village with respect to each of the
factors described in Subsection D(1) through (4) on which the denial is based is not supported by
a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the administrative proceeding.
§ 5-6C-7.1. Franchise renewal in the event of change in federal
law.
[12-28-1998]
In the event that any or all of the above-referenced provisions of federal law are repealed, the following
relevant section(s) shall apply:
At least 24 months prior to the expiration of the franchise, the Grantee shall inform the Village in
writing of its intent to seek renewal of the franchise.
The Grantee shall submit a proposal for renewal which demonstrates:
That it has been and continues to be in substantial compliance with the material terms,
conditions, and limitations of this article and its franchise;
That its system has been installed, constructed, maintained and operated in accordance with
the accepted standards of the industry, and this article and its franchise;
That it has the legal, technical, financial, and other qualifications to provide the facilities,
services and equipment set forth in its proposal; and
That it has made a good faith effort to provide services and facilities which accommodate the
demonstrated needs of the community as may be reasonably ascertained by the Village
through a public process.
After giving public notice, the Village shall proceed to determine whether the Grantee has
satisfactorily performed its obligations under the franchise. To determine satisfactory performance,
the Village shall consider technical developments and performance of the system, programming,

other services offered, cost of services, and any other particular requirements set forth in this
article. The Village shall also consider the Grantee's reports made to the Village and to the FCC,
and the Village may require the Grantee to make available specified records, documents, and
information for this purpose, and may inquire specifically whether the Grantee will supply services
sufficient to meet community needs and interests. Industry performance on a national basis shall
also be considered. Provision shall be made for public comment with adequate prior notice of at
least 10 days.
The Village shall then prepare any amendments to this article that it believes necessary.
If the Village finds the Grantee's performance satisfactory, and finds the Grantee's technical, legal,
and financial abilities acceptable, and finds the Grantee's renewal proposal meets the future
cable-related needs of the Village, a new franchise may be granted pursuant to this article as
amended for a period to be determined.
If the Grantee is determined by the Village to have performed unsatisfactorily, new applicants may
be sought and evaluated and a franchise award shall be made by the Village according to
franchising procedures adopted by the Village.
§ 5-6C-8. Police powers.
[12-28-1998]
In accepting a franchise, the Grantee acknowledges that its rights thereunder are subject to the
police power of the Village to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and
welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances
enacted by the Village pursuant to such power.
Any conflict between the provisions of a franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise
of the Village's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise
that is not of general application in the jurisdiction, or applies exclusively to the Grantee or cable
television systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this article, shall prevail only if upon
such exercise the Village finds a danger to health, safety, property or the general welfare or if such
exercise is mandated by law.
§ 5-6C-9. Cable television franchise required.
[12-28-1998]
No cable television system shall be allowed to operate or to occupy or use the streets (i.e., rights-ofway)
for system installation and maintenance purposes without a franchise.
§ 5-6C-10. Use of grantee facilities.
[12-28-1998]
The Village and the Grantee shall work together to agree to terms and conditions which allow the
Village to install and maintain upon the poles of the Grantee, any wire or pole fixtures that do not
unreasonably interfere with the cable television system operations of the Grantee, so long as the
Village maintains a similar right with the utilities operating in the Village. The Village shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Grantee from any claim that might arise due to or as a result of the Village's
use.

Costs to be borne by a Grantee shall include any requirements or charges incidental to the awarding or
enforcing of its initial franchise, but shall not be limited to: reasonable administrative, engineering, legal
and consulting expenses, all costs of publications of notices prior to any public meeting provided for
pursuant to this article, and any costs not covered by application fees incurred by the Village in its
study, preparation of proposal documents, evaluation of all applications, and examinations of the

shall maintain a central office to address any issues relating to operating under this cable television
ordinance.
§ 5-6C-13. Letter of credit/security deposit.
[12-28-1998]
Within 15 days after the award of an initial franchise, the Grantee shall deposit with the Village
either an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution or a security deposit in the amount
of $100,000 with the form to be established by the Village.
Within 15 days after the award of a renewal franchise, the Grantee shall deposit with the Village
either an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution or a security deposit in the amount
of $10,000 with the form to be established by the Village.
The form and content of such letter of credit or security deposit shall be approved by the Village
Attorney. These instruments shall be used to ensure the faithful performance of the Grantee of all
provisions of this article, and to ensure compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any
agency, commission, board, department, division, or office of the Village having jurisdiction over its
acts or defaults under this article, and to ensure the payment by the Grantee of any claims, liens,
and taxes due the Village which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of
the system.
The letter of credit or security deposit shall be maintained at the amount established in Subsection
A, of this section for the entire term of the franchise, even if amounts have to be withdrawn
pursuant to this article.
If the Grantee fails to pay to the Village any compensation within the time fixed herein; or fails to
pay to the Village any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the Village any damages, costs or
expenses which the Village is compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the Grantee in
connection with the franchise, the Village shall provide Grantee with written notice informing
Grantee that such amounts are due to the Village. The written notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the specific reasons for the assessment. The Grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to
receipt of the notice in which to pay the amounts the Village has stated it is owed, or within 10
days of receipt of the Village notice, notify the Village that there is a dispute as to whether Grantee
believes such amounts are due the Village. Such notice by the Grantee to the Village shall specify
with particularity the basis of Grantee's belief that such monies are not due the Village, and shall
stay the running of the thirty-day cure period pending a Board decision. The Board shall hear the
Grantee's dispute. Grantee must be given at least 10 days' notice of the hearing. At the hearing,
the Grantee shall be entitled to the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by
counsel. After the hearing, the Village shall provide Grantee a copy of its action, along with

supporting documents. In the event the Village upholds the finding of outstanding monies due the
Village by Grantee, the Village may immediately withdraw the amount thereof, with interest from
the letter of credit or security deposit.
The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the letter of credit are in addition to all other
rights of the Village, whether reserved by the franchise or authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any other right the
Village may have.
The letter of credit shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed
that this letter of credit or security deposit may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not
to renew be stated by the surety until 30 days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail, of a
written notice of such intention to cancel or not to renew."
Upon receipt of the thirty-day notice, this shall be construed as a default granting the Village the
right to demand payment from the bank for either the security deposit or letter of credit.
The Village at any time during the term of this article, may waive Grantee's requirement to
maintain a letter of credit or security deposit. The waiver of the requirement can be initiated by the
Village or Grantee.
§ 5-6C-14. Performance bond.
[12-28-1998]
Within 30 days after the award of an initial or renewal franchise, the Grantee shall file with the
Village a performance bond in the amount of $100,000. This bond shall be maintained throughout
the construction period, and until such time as determined by the Village, unless specified in the
franchise agreement.
If the Grantee fails to comply with any law, ordinance or resolution governing the franchise, or fails
to well and truly observe, fulfill and perform each term and condition of the franchise, as it relates
to the conditions relative to the construction, operation or maintenance of the system, including the
franchise agreement that is incorporated herein by reference, there shall be recoverable jointly
and severally, from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the
Village as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of
removal or abandonment of any property of the Grantee, plus a reasonable allowance for
attorney's fees, including the Village's legal staff, and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. This
section shall be an additional remedy for any and all violations outlined in § 5-6C-13.
The Village may, upon completion of construction of the service area, waive or reduce the
requirements of the Grantee to maintain the bond. However, the Village may require a
performance bond to be posted by the Grantee for any construction subsequent to the completion
of the initial service areas, in a reasonable amount and upon such terms as determined by the
Village.
The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this
bond may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until
30 days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail, a written notice of such intent to cancel and
not to renew."
Upon receipt of a thirty-day notice, this shall be construed as default granting the Village the right
to demand payment on the bond.
The Village, at any time during the term of this article, may waive Grantee's requirement to
maintain a performance bond. The waiver of the requirement can be initiated by the Village or the
Grantee.

any person or property from any cause whatsoever arising out of the construction, maintenance,

the Indemnitees by reason of any claim or lien arising out of work, labor, materials or supplies

Any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, claims, liens, costs, charges, losses
and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,

against the Indemnitees by reason of any financing or securities offering by Grantee or its
Affiliates for violations of the common law or any laws, statutes or regulations of the State of

Commission, whether by the Grantee or otherwise; excluding therefrom, however, claims
which are solely based upon and arise solely out of information supplied by the Village to the
Grantee in writing and included in the offering materials with the express written approval of
the Village prior to the offering.
Assumption of risk. The Grantee undertakes and assumes for its officers, agents, contractors and
subcontractors and employees all risk of dangerous conditions, if any, on or about any Villageowned

Illinois Statutes, including the limits of liability of the Village as exists presently or as may be
increased from time to time by the Legislature.

units within the service area within six months from the date of the award of the

The Grantee must make cable television service available to at least 50% of the dwelling
units within the service area within one year from the date of the award of the franchise.
The Grantee, in its application, may propose a timetable of construction which will make cable

in which case the said schedule will be made part of the franchise agreement, and will be
binding upon the Grantee.
Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically approved by the Village, will
be considered a violation of this article for which the provisions of either § 5-6C-37 or 5-6C-47

substantial completion to be not less than 95%. Justification for less than 100% must be
submitted subject to the approval of the Village.
Line extensions.
In areas of the franchise territory not included in the initial service areas, the Grantee shall be
required to extend its system pursuant to the following requirements:
No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. Grantee is hereby authorized to extend
the Cable System as necessary within the Village. To expedite the process of extending
the Cable System into a new subdivision, the Village will forward to the Grantee an
approved engineering plan of each project. Subject to the density requirements, the
Grantee shall commence the design and construction process upon receipt of the final
engineering plan. Upon notification from the Village that the first home in the project has
been approved for a building permit, the Grantee shall have a maximum of three months
to complete the construction/activation process within the applicable project phase.
The Grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to every dwelling
unit in all unserved, developing areas having at least 20 dwelling units planned per street
mile, as measured from the existing system, and shall make every effort to extend its
system simultaneously with the installation of utility lines, provided that it can enter into
such joint trench agreements on reasonable terms and conditions.
Early extension. In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of service,
the Grantee shall provide, upon the request of a potential subscriber desiring service, an
estimate of the Grantee's costs required to extend service to the subscriber. The Grantee
shall then extend service upon request of the potential subscriber. The Grantee may require
advance payment or assurance of payment satisfactory to the Grantee. In the event the area
subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be
refunded to the subscriber.
New development undergrounding. In case of new construction or property development
where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give the
Grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development, and of the particular date on
which open trenching will be available for the Grantee's installation of conduit, pedestals
and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at the Grantee's expense. The Grantee shall also
provide specifications as needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to
bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except
that if the Grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals within 10
working days of the date the trenches are available, as designated in the notice given by the
developer or property owner, then should the trenches be closed after the ten-day period, the
cost of new trenching is to be borne by the Grantee. Except for the notice from the developer
or property owner of the particular date on which trenching will be available to the Grantee,
notice provided to the Grantee by the Village of the opening of a trench shall also satisfy the
requirement of reasonable notice if sent to the local general manager or system engineer of
the Grantee.
Special agreements. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the Grantee from serving areas
not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners, residents, or
businesses.
A Grantee, in its application, may propose a line extension policy that will result in serving more
residents of the Village than as required above, in which case the Grantee's policy will be
incorporated into the franchise agreement and will be binding on the Grantee.
The violation of this section shall be considered a breach of the terms of this article, for which the
provisions of either § 5-6C-38 or 5-6C-47 shall apply, as determined by the Village.

Interference with persons and improvements. The Grantee's system, poles, wires and
appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall
endanger or interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with the rights or reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets and public ways, or interfere with
any improvements the Village may deem proper to make, or unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the
free use of the streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property.
Restoration to prior condition. In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, landscaping,
driveway or other surfacing, the Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner
approved by the Village, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping or
surface of any street or alley disturbed, in as good condition as before the work was commenced
and in accordance with standards for such work set by the Village.
Erection, removal and common uses of poles.
No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the Grantee without prior
approval of the Village with regard to location, height, types, and any other pertinent aspect.
However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the Grantee shall be a vested
interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the Grantee at its own
expense whenever the Village determines that the public convenience would be enhanced
thereby.
Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the Village are
available for use by the Grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the Village
may require the Grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public
convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the Grantee
are just and reasonable.
Relocation of facilities. If at any time during the period of the franchise the Village shall elect to
alter, or change the grade of any street, alley or other public ways, the Grantee, upon reasonable
notice by the Village, shall remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground
conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense.
Cooperation with building movers. The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a
building moving permit issued by the Village, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the
moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be
paid by the person requesting the same, and the Grantee shall have the authority to require such
payment in advance. The Grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours' advance notice to
arrange for such temporary wire changes.
Tree trimming. The Grantee shall not remove any tree or trim any portion, either above, at or
below ground level, of any tree within any public place without the prior consent of the Village. The
Grantee shall provide notice to any affected residents at the same time that the Grantee applies to
the Village for consent to perform tree trimming. The Village shall have the right to do the trimming
requested by the Grantee at the cost of the Grantee. Regardless of who performs the work
requested by the Grantee, the Grantee shall be responsible, shall defend and hold Village
harmless from any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the property
surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed.

§ 5-6C-24. Customer service standards.
[12-28-1998]
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit the enforcement of any federal, state or local

Excluding those situations that are beyond its control, the Grantee will respond to any service
interruption promptly and in no event later than 24 hours from the time of initial notification. All
other regular service requests will be responded to within 36 hours during the normal work
week for that system. The appointment window alternatives for installations, service calls and
other installation activities will be: "morning" or "afternoon"; not to exceed a four-hour
"window" during normal business hours for the system, or at a time that is mutually
acceptable. The Grantee shall schedule supplemental hours during which appointments can
be scheduled based on the needs of the community. If at any time an installer or technician is
running late, an attempt to contact the customer will be made and the appointment
rescheduled as necessary at a time that is convenient to the customer.

§ 5-6C-25. Continuity of service mandatory.
[12-28-1998]
It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service as long as their financial and
other obligations to the Grantee are honored. If the Grantee elects to over build, rebuild, modify or
sell the system, the Grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances for a period not to exceed six months. If the
Village gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew the franchise, the Grantee shall act so
as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the
circumstances, for a period not to exceed three months after the franchise agreement has
terminated.
If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator acquires the system, the Grantee shall
cooperate with the Village, new franchisee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all
subscribers. During such period, the Grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period
during which it operates the system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its services until
it no longer operates the system.
If the Grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days without prior approval of the
Village or without just cause, the Village may, at its option, operate the system or designate an
operator until such time as the Grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the Village
or a permanent operator is selected. If the Village is required to fulfill this obligation for the
Grantee, the Village shall be entitled to all revenues for any period during which it operates the
system and the Grantee shall reimburse the Village for all reasonable costs or damages in excess
of revenues from the system received by the Village that are the result of the Grantee's failure to
perform.
§ 5-6C-26. Complaint procedure.
[12-28-1998]
The Mayor or chief elected official is designated as having primary responsibility for the continuing
administration of the franchise and for the implementation of complaint procedures.
During the terms of the franchise and any renewal thereof, the Grantee shall maintain a central
office for the purpose of receiving and resolving all complaints regarding the quality of service,
equipment malfunctions, and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local and/or tollfree
telephone call to receive complaints regarding quality of service, equipment functions and
similar matters. The Grantee will make good faith efforts to arrange for one or more payment
locations in a central location where customers can pay bills or conduct other business activities.
As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the Grantee shall, by appropriate
means, such as a card or brochure, furnish information concerning the procedures for making
inquiries or complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of the employee
or employees or agent to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed.
When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists other evidence, which, in
the judgment of the Village, in consultation with the Grantee, casts doubt on the reliability or
quality of cable service, the Village shall have the right and authority to require the Grantee to test,
analyze and report on the performance of the system. The Grantee shall fully cooperate with the
Village in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if requested, within 30
days after notice. Such report shall include the following information:
The nature of the complaint or problem that precipitated the special tests;

The system component(s) tested;
The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;
The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved;
Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may be required.
The Village may request that tests be supervised, at the Village's expense, by an independent
professional engineer or equivalent of the Village's choice. The engineer shall sign all records of
special tests and forward to the Village such records with a report interpreting the results of the
tests and recommending actions to be taken.
The Village's rights under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis and reports
covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence when and
under such circumstances as the Village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or
other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable
service.
§ 5-6C-27. Grantee rules and regulations.
[12-28-1998]
The Grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions
governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the Grantee to
exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the franchise, and to assure uninterrupted service
to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions
shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and
regulations.
§ 5-6C-28. Franchise fee.
[12-28-1998]
A Grantee shall pay to the Village a franchise fee in the amount designated in the franchise
agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement, such franchise fee shall be the
maximum amount as allowed by law or such lesser amount as may be designated by the Village.
The franchise fee payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the Village by
the Grantee and shall not be construed as payment in lieu of municipal property taxes or other
state, County or local taxes.
The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable quarterly on a
calendar year basis to the Village within 30 days of the end of each quarter. The Grantee shall
also file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross receipts as previously defined
within 30 days after the end of the quarter.
The Village shall have the right to inspect the Grantee's income records and the right to audit and
to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article; provided, however, that
such audit shall take place within 60 months following the close of each of the Grantee's fiscal
years. Any additional amount due the Village as a result of an audit shall be paid within 30 days
following written notice to the Grantee by the Village, which notice shall include a copy of the audit
report.
If any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty, is not made on or before the
applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at an annual

incurred by the Village by reason of the delinquent payment(s).
§ 5-6C-29. Transfer of ownership or control.
[12-28-1998]
A franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased or sublet in
any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property
therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the Village, except that
any financing arrangement, including but not limited to a mortgage or pledge, shall not be deemed
a "transfer" controlled by this section. The Grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise
to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the
franchise back to the Grantee without such consent, providing that such assignment is without any
release of liability of the Grantee. Any proposed assignee must show legal, technical and financial
responsibility as determined by the Village and must agree to comply with all provisions of the
franchise. The Village shall have 120 days to act upon any request for approval of a sale or
transfer submitted in writing that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with FCC regulations and by the Village of Thornton. The Village shall be deemed to
have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not communicated
in writing to the Grantee within 120 days following receipt of written notice and receipt of all
necessary information as to the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public,
unless the requesting party and the Village agree to an extension of time. The Village shall not
unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer.
The Grantee shall promptly notify the Village of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or
acquisition by any other party of, control of the Grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not
limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A
rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or
accumulation by any person or group of persons of 5% of the voting shares of the Grantee. Every
change, transfer or acquisition of control of the Grantee that is not conducted pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this article shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until
the Village shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For
the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of
control, the Village may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the
Grantee shall assist the Village in such inquiry.
The consent or approval of the Village to any transfer of the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver
or release of the rights of the Village in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be
expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise.
In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Village shall not be required to approve any
transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the
proposed system.
In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor(s) in
interest becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement.
§ 5-6C-30. Availability of books and records.
[12-28-1998]
The Grantee shall fully cooperate in making available at reasonable times, and the Village shall
have the right to inspect, where reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the franchise, books,
records, maps, plans and other like materials of the Grantee applicable to the cable television

Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor form) or any supplemental forms related to

Federal Communications Commission, to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or to any other
federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting
cable television operations authorized pursuant to the franchise or received from such agencies shall
be provided upon request to the Village.
§ 5-6C-32. Fiscal reports.
[12-28-1998]
The Grantee shall file annually with the Village no later than 120 days after the end of the Grantee's
fiscal year, a copy of a gross revenues statement certified by an officer of the Grantee.
§ 5-6C-33. Removal of cable television system.
[12-28-1998]
At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted or when any renewal is denied, or upon
its termination as provided herein, the Grantee shall forthwith, upon notice by the Village, remove at its
own expense all designated portions of the cable television system from all streets and public property
within the Village. If the Grantee fails to do so, the Village may perform the work at the Grantee's
expense. Upon such notice of removal, a bond shall be furnished by the Grantee in an amount
sufficient to cover this expense.
§ 5-6C-34. Required services and facilities.
[12-28-1998]
The Grantee shall make available to Subscribers the option to receive a minimum of 85 channels.

signals interconnecting designated entities to be determined by the Village. Such Network
may be provided as needed by utilizing capacity on the System.
Provided, however, that the public access, education and local government channels shall be
combined on one channel until such time as additional channels become necessary as
mutually agreed to by the Village and the Grantee. The Grantee shall make a channel
available for leased access uses in accordance with the requirements of federal law. Studios
and associated production equipment will be located in a mutually agreed upon site to meet
the public's need for public access, education and local government channels as noted in (1),
(2) and (3). Financial and technical support and replacement and maintenance of equipment
of this facility shall be separately incorporated into the franchise by agreement.
The Grantee shall provide emergency broadcast capacity pursuant to FCC rules. The Grantee
shall cooperate with the Village in the use and operation of the emergency alert override system.
Interconnection.
The Grantee may be requested to interconnect its system with other communication facilities.
Such interconnection shall be made within the time limit established by the Village.
Interconnection procedure. Upon receiving a request from the Village to interconnect, the
franchisee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system or systems in
order that all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both construction and
operation of the interconnection link.
Relief. The franchisee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or the
Village may rescind its request to interconnect upon petition by the franchisee to the Village if
it finds that the franchisee has negotiated in good faith and has arrived at impasse with the
operator or franchising authority of the system to be interconnected, or if the franchisee
determines that the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable
increase in subscriber rates or that interconnection is technically unfeasible.
Cooperation required. The Grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation,
regional interconnection authority or Village, county, state and federal regulatory agency
which may be hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing, or otherwise
providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the boundaries of the Village.
The Grantee shall provide such additional services and facilities as are contained in its application,
which is incorporated by reference herein.

§ 5-6C-36. Performance evaluation sessions.
[12-28-1998]
The Village and the Grantee may hold scheduled yearly performance evaluation sessions within
30 days of the third, sixth and ninth anniversary dates of the Grantee's award or renewal of the
franchise and as may be required by federal and state law.
Special evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the term of the franchise at the

evaluation session.
§ 5-6C-37. Rate change procedures.
[12-28-1998]
Pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, the Village of
Thornton is currently certified to regulate the Basic Service rates charged by Grantee. Under these
rules, Grantee is required to obtain approval from the Village for a rate increase for any change to the
rates for Basic Service. Should federal or state law permit further rate regulation beyond Basic Service,
the Village of Thornton may assume such rate regulation and adopt appropriate procedures for such
regulation.
§ 5-6C-38. Forfeiture and termination.
[12-28-1998]
In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the Village under this article or otherwise, the
Village reserves the right to terminate the franchise and all rights and privileges of the Grantee

the Grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to the following:
Violation of any material provision of the franchise or any material rule, order, regulation or
determination of the Village made pursuant to the franchise;

Attempt to evade any material provision of the franchise or to practice any fraud or deceit
upon the Village or its subscribers or customers;
Failure to begin or complete system construction or system extension as provided under § 5-
6C-20.
Failure to provide the services promised in the Grantee's initial application as incorporated
herein by § 5-6C-4.
Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when
approval of such interruption is obtained from the Village; or
Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or negotiation of the franchise.
The foregoing shall not constitute a major breach if the violation occurs but is without fault of the
Grantee or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control. The Grantee shall not be
excused by mere economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers
or employees.
The Village may make a written demand that the Grantee comply with any such provision, rule,
order or determination under or pursuant to the franchise. If the violation by the Grantee continues
for a period of 30 days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective
action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the Village may place the
issue of termination of the franchise before the Village Board. The Village shall cause to be served
upon the Grantee, at least 20 days prior to the date of such meeting, a written notice of intent to
request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the
meeting and the issue(s) which the Board is to consider.
The Village Board shall hear and consider the issue(s) and shall hear any person interested
therein and any relevant evidence, and shall determine whether or not any violation by a Grantee
has occurred, after affording Grantee rights of due process to be heard and an opportunity to
present all relevant evidence and witnesses. The Grantee may, at its own expense, make a
transcript of any such hearing.
If the Village Board determines that the violation by the Grantee was the fault of the Grantee and
within its control, the Board may, by resolution declare that the franchise of the Grantee shall be
forfeited and terminated unless there is compliance within such period as the Board may fix, such
period to not be less than 30 days; provided, however, that no opportunity for compliance need be
granted for fraud or misrepresentation. Any such resolution shall state with particularity the
reasons for forfeiture and termination.
The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the Board agenda at the
expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The Board may then terminate the franchise
forthwith upon finding that the Grantee has failed to achieve compliance or it may further extend
the period, at its discretion.
§ 5-6C-39. Foreclosure.
[12-28-1998]
Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the system, or upon the
termination of any lease covering all or a substantial part of the system, the Grantee shall notify the
Village of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of
the Grantee has taken place, and the provisions of the franchise governing the consent of the Village
to such change in control of the Grantee shall apply.

The Village shall have the right to cancel a franchise 120 days after the appointment of a receiver,
or trustee, to take over and conduct the business of the Grantee, whether in receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship
shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of 120 days, or unless:
Within 120 days after his/her election or appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully
complied with all the provisions of this article and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
Such receiver or trustee, within the 120 days, shall have executed an agreement, duly
approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee
assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this article and the franchise
granted to the Grantee.
§ 5-6C-41. Compliance with state and federal laws.
[12-28-1998]
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the franchise to the contrary, the Grantee shall at all times
comply with all laws and regulations of the state and federal government or any administrative
agencies thereof; provided, however, if any such state or federal law or regulation shall require the
Grantee to perform any service, or shall permit the Grantee to perform any service, or shall
prohibit the Grantee from performing any service, in conflict with the terms of the franchise or of
any law or regulation of the Village, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the
Grantee shall notify the Village of the point of conflict believed to exist between such regulation or
law and the laws or regulations of the Village or the franchise.
If the Village determines that a material provision of this article is affected by any subsequent
action of the state or federal government, the Village and the Grantee shall negotiate to modify
any of the provisions herein to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full
intent and purpose of this agreement.
§ 5-6C-42. Landlord/tenant.
[12-28-1998]
Interference with cable service prohibited. Neither the owner of any multiple unit residential
dwelling nor his agent or representative shall interfere with the right of any tenant or lawful
resident thereof to receive cable television service, cable installation or maintenance from a cable
television Grantee regulated by and lawfully operating under a valid and existing franchise issued
by the Village.
Penalties and charges to tenants for service prohibited. Neither the owner or any multiple unit
residential dwelling nor his agent or representative shall penalize, charge or surcharge a tenant or
resident or forfeit or threaten to forfeit any right of such tenant or resident, or discriminate in any
way against such tenant or resident who requests or receives cable television service from a
Grantee operating under a valid and existing cable television franchise issued by the Village.
Reselling service prohibited. No person shall resell, without the expressed, written consent of both
the Grantee and the Village, any cable service, program or signal transmitted by a cable television
Grantee under a franchise issued by the Village.
Protection of property permitted. Nothing in this article shall prohibit a person from requiring that
cable television system facilities conform to laws and regulations and reasonable conditions

The Village reserves the right to reject any and all bids and waive informalities and/or

No franchise will be granted to any applicant unless all requirements and demands of the Village
regarding financial, contractual, shareholder and system disclosure have been met.
Applicants, including all shareholders and parties with any interest in the applicant, shall fully
disclose all agreements and undertakings, whether written or oral, or implied with any person, firm,
group, association or corporation with respect to the franchise and the proposed cable television
system. The Grantee of a franchise shall disclose all other contracts to the Village as the contracts
are made. This section shall include, but not be limited to, any agreements between local
applicants and national companies.
Applicants, including all shareholders and parties with any interest in the applicant, shall submit all
requested information as provided by the terms of this article or the application documents, which
are incorporated herein by reference. The requested information must be complete and verified as
true by the applicant.

§ 5-6C-45. Theft of services and tampering.
[12-28-1998]
No person may intentionally do any of the following:
Obtain or attempt to obtain cable television service from a company by trick, artifice,
deception, use of an illegal device or illegal decoder or other fraudulent means with the intent
to deprive that company of any or all lawful compensation for rendering each type of service
obtained. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from the
presence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a device not
authorized by the cable television company, the major purpose of which is to permit reception

of cable television services without payment. This inference is rebutted if the defendant
demonstrates that he or she purchased that device for a legitimate use.
Give technical assistance or instruction to any person in obtaining or attempting to obtain any
cable television service without payment of all lawful compensation to the company providing
that service. This paragraph does not apply if the defendant demonstrates that the technical
assistance or instruction was given or the installation of the connection, descrambler or
receiving device was for a legitimate use.
Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or by
other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of
cable television services for the purpose of distributing cable television service to any other
dwelling unit without authority from a cable television company.
Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical, mechanical, acoustical or by
other means, with any cables, wires, components or other devices used for the distribution of
cable television services for the purpose of obtaining cable television service without payment
of all lawful compensation to the company providing the service. The intent required for a
violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that the cable service to the defendant's
residence or business was connected under a service agreement with the defendant and has
been disconnected by the cable television company and that thereafter there exists in fact a
connection to the cable system at the defendant's residence or business.
Make or maintain any modification or alteration to any device installed with the authorization
of a cable television company for the purpose of intercepting or receiving any program or
other service carried by that company which that person is not authorized by that company to
receive. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that,
as a matter of standard procedure, the cable television company places written warning labels
on its converters or decoders explaining that the tampering with the device is a violation of
law and that the converter or decoder is found to have been tampered with, altered or
modified so as to allow the reception or interception of programming carried by the cable
television company without authority to do so. The trier of fact may also infer that a converter
or decoder has been altered or modified from proof that the cable television company, as a
matter of standard procedure, seals the converters or decoders with a label or mechanical
device, that the seal was shown to the customer upon delivery of the decoder and that the
seal has been removed or broken. The inferences under this paragraph are rebutted if the
cable television company cannot demonstrate that the intact seal was shown to the customer.
Possess without authority any device or printed circuit board designed to receive from a cable
television system any cable television programming or services offered for sale over that
cable television system, whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered,
scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, or perform or facilitate the performance of any of
the acts under Subsection A1 through 5 with the intent that that device or printed circuit be
used to receive that cable television company's services without payment. Intent to violate
this paragraph for direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain may be
inferred from proof of the existence on the property and in the actual possession of the
defendant of a device if the totality of circumstances, including quantities or volumes,
indicates possession for resale.
Manufacture, import into this state, distribute, publish, advertise, sell, lease or offer for sale or
lease any device, printed circuit board or any plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit
designed to receive the cable television programming or services offered for sale over a cable
television system from a cable television system, whether or not the programming or services
are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made unintelligible, with the intent that the
device, printed circuit, plan or kit be used for the reception of that company's services without
payment. The intent required for a violation of this paragraph may be inferred from proof that
the defendant has sold, leased or offered for sale or lease any device, printed circuit board,
plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit board in violation of this paragraph and during

Civil liability for theft of cable television service.
Any person who incurs injury as a result of a violation of § 5-6C-46 may bring a civil action
against the person who committed the violation.
If the person who incurs the loss prevails against a person who committed the violation
willfully and for the purpose of commercial advantage or prevails against a person who has
committed more than one violation of § 5-6C-46, the court may grant the prevailing party any
or all the following:
Except as provided in Subsection B2e, not more than $10,000 per violation.
Actual damages.
Any profits of the violators that are attributable to the violation and that are not taken into
account in determining the amount of actual damages under Subsection B2b.
Notwithstanding the limitations under ILCS 799.25 or 814.04, costs, disbursement and
reasonable attorney's fees.
If the court finds that the violation was committed willfully and for the purpose of
commercial advantage, the court may increase the amount granted under Subsection
B2a not to exceed $50,000 per violation.
If damages under Subsection B2c are requested, the party who committed the violation shall
be required to provide information on the violator's gross revenues, the violator's deductible
expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the violation.
In addition to other remedies available under this section, the courts may grant the injured
party a temporary or permanent injunction.
§ 5-6C-46. Penalties.
[12-28-1998]
For the violation of any of the following provisions of this article, penalties shall be chargeable to the
letter of credit as follows and the Village may determine the amount of the forfeiture for other violations
which are not specified in a sum not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, with each day constituting a
separate violation:
Failure to furnish, maintain, or offer all cable services to any potential Subscriber within the Village
upon order of the Village: $100 per day, per violation, for each day that such failure occurs or
continues;
Failure to obtain or file evidence of required insurance, construction bond, performance bond, or
other required financial security: $200 per day, per violation, for each day such failure occurs or
continues;
Failure to provide access to data, documents, records, or reports to the Village as required by
§§ 5-6C-19, 5-6C-29, 5-6C-31 and 5-6C-37: $100 per day, per violation, for each day such failure
occurs or continues;

day, per violation;

§ 5-6C-47. Procedures.
[12-28-1998]
Whenever the Village believes that the Grantee has violated one or more terms, conditions or
provisions of the franchise, and wishes to impose monetary penalties, a written notice shall be
given to the Grantee informing it of such alleged violation or liability. The written notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the specific violation so as to afford the Grantee an opportunity to
remedy the violation. The Grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which
to correct the violation before the Village may impose penalties unless the violation is of such a
nature so as to require more than 30 days and the Grantee proceeds diligently within the 30 days
to correct the violation. In any case where the violation is not cured within 60 days of notice from
the Village, or such other time as the Grantee and the Village may mutually agree to, the Village
may proceed to impose liquidated damages.
The Grantee may, within 10 days of receipt of notice, notify the Village that there is a dispute as to
whether a violation or failure has, in fact, occurred. Such notice by the Grantee to the Village shall
specify with particularity the matters disputed by the Grantee and shall stay the running of the
thirty-day cure period pending Board decision as required below. The Board shall hear the
Grantee's dispute. Grantee must be given at least five days' notice of the hearing. At the hearing,
the Grantee shall be entitled to the right to present evidence and the right to be represented by
counsel. After the hearing, the Village shall provide Grantee a copy of its action, along with
supporting documents. In the event the Village upholds the finding of a violation, the Grantee shall
have 30 days subsequent, or such other time period as the Grantee and the Village mutually
agree, to correct the violation.
The rights reserved to the Village under this section are in addition to all other rights of the Village
whether reserved by this article or authorized by law or equity, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of a right with respect to penalties shall affect any other right the Village may have.

review of a new location, new or different structure to be co-located upon, new
antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility.
Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved permit to co-locate a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the Village and the applicant shall enter into a
master pole attachment agreement, provided by the Village for the initial co-location on a
municipal utility pole by the application. For subsequent approved permits to co-locate a
small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the Village and the applicant shall enter
into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement.
Completeness of application.
Within 30 days after receiving an application, the Village shall determine whether the
application is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the
Village must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all
documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in the Village's permit
application form are submitted by the applicant to the Village.
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
An express written agreement by both the applicant and the Village; or
A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes the delay.
Consolidated applications.
An applicant seeking to co-locate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
Village shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application
and receive a single permit for the co-location of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the
co-locations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may remove small
wireless facility co-locations from the application and treat separately small wireless
facility co-locations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not
qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The Village may issue separate
permits for each co-location that is approved in a consolidated application.
Duration of permits.
The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, and the permit
shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the Village makes a finding that the
small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the
applicable Village codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this
article.
If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be
subject to the applicable Village Code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of
renewal.

Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information
and notices to the Village by personal delivery at the Village's designated place of business,
by regular mail postmarked on the date due, or by any other commonly used means,
including electronic mail.
Co-location requirements and conditions.
Public safety space reservation. The Village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for
future public safety uses, for the Village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of
space may not preclude the co-location of a small wireless facility unless the Village
reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify
its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the
requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its
employees, agents or contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless
facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and
governmental standards and regulations.
No interference with public safety communication frequencies.
The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the
frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will
not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to
the public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider,
at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with the public safety spectrum
established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR
90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675.
The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal
Regulations cited in the previous subsection. Failure to remedy the interference as
required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
Co-location on poles that are part of electric distribution system.
The wireless provider shall not co-locate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles
that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication
worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be
located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the top of the pole,
if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for
work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space," "communication
worker safety zone," and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms
in the National Electrical Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers.

The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or
regulations that concern public safety.
The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable
for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements
that are set forth in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a
comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rightsof-
way, including on an historic landmark or in an historic district.
Alternate placements.
Except as provided in this co-location requirements and conditions section, a wireless
provider shall not be required to co-locate small wireless facilities on any specific utility
pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to co-locate multiple antenna systems on
a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the co-location of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the small
wireless facility be co-located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support
structure within 100 feet of the proposed co-location, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions and the
alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a co-location proposed by the Village, the applicant shall provide
written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons
the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this subsection.
Height limitations.
The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than 10 feet above the
utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is co-located.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless
facilities are co-located may not exceed the higher of:
Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole
supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is
submitted to the Village, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement
utility pole or wireless support structure, and that is in the same right-of-way within
the jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate which
intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless
support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
Forty-five feet above ground level.
Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement
pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed
for co-location, the applicant shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms
and conditions set forth in the Village of Thornton Zoning Ordinance.[2]
Editor's Note: See Title 11, Zoning.
Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that
are imposed by a contract between the Village and a private property owner that concern
design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground mounted equipment
located in the right-of-way.

regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or
the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such
new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of
utility poles.
Co-location completion deadline. Co-location for which a permit is granted shall be completed
within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider
agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the
wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit
for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation
does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void
unless the Village grants an extension, in writing, to the applicant.
Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
The applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application to co-locate a single
small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350 for
each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated application to co-locate more than
one small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures.
The applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000 for each small wireless facility addressed
in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for such co-location.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local ordinance, applications pursuant
to this section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be
nonrefundable.
The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or require any fees or other
charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
Routine maintenance;
The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar,
the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the Village at least 10 days prior

The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement of micro wireless
facilities suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance
with applicable safety codes.
Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work within rights-of-way for
activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures.
Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this article authorizes a person to co-locate small wireless
facilities on:
Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the Village or another
unit of local government that is not located within a right-of-way, or a privately owned utility
pole or wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner;

permit its free passage into and out of the waste container, and finally deposited after such
wrapping, in such waste container as soon as practicable after the same is produced or
brought therein or thereon. Waste containers to which garbage is frozen through failure to
observe these regulations and all containers which are other than as specified in this chapter
will not be serviced by the waste disposal crews of the Village waste disposal contractor.

shall make a complete detailed report to the President of his estimate of the cost of repairing and
restoring such building, and shall also deliver the appraisal by the appraisal committee or other
authority, to the President.
If such estimate and appraisal shall show that the building has become damaged by fire, decay or
has otherwise depreciated to the extent of 50% or more of its value as so appraised, the President
and Board of Trustees may adopt a resolution finding such to be the fact and setting a time and
place at which the owner may appear before the Board or a committee of the Board to be heard

deliver a copy of the resolution to the owner. The Board shall then proceed to cause the removal
of such building as in case of a nuisance, and the owner shall be required to reimburse the Village
for the entire cost of such removal.
If the owner cannot be found, the Village Clerk shall deliver or send copies of such resolution and
notice by registered or certified mail to his last known address and shall post copies thereof upon
the building. If the building is occupied, the Village Clerk shall also deliver copies of such
resolution and notice to the occupant.

The color scheme for the facility shall be subject to the approval of the Building Official.
No advertising, logos, or corporate symbols shall be permitted on any wireless service facility
or any building or structure accessory thereto.

Except in cases where a height bonus has been granted pursuant to Subsections D and E
below, the maximum height of any single facility tower or antenna shall be 50 feet.
Screening techniques such as landscaping, berming, screening, and fencing shall be
incorporated into each site as deemed appropriate by the Building Official. A fence or wall of
eight feet in height shall be required to encompass a freestanding wireless service facility,

creation of the facility from a public right-of-way or any residential lot.
All wireless service facilities, including any associated accessory building or structure, shall
meet the setback requirements of the district in which they are located. All wireless service

Roof- and building-mounted wireless service facilities and antennas located in the B-2, B-

antenna shall not extend to a height greater than 20 feet above the host building.
Collection.
The Village encourages collocation of wireless service facilities on existing or planned
wireless service facilities in order to minimize the proliferation of antenna support structures
and to achieve the most efficient use of land within the community. Therefore, the Village may
grant access to municipally owned property and may lower or waive application fees for
applicants locating additional antennas on an existing facility. In addition, a height bonus may
be granted to an applicant that incorporates two or more antennas upon the applicant's
facility, however, no facility shall exceed a height of 50 feet.
When asking for additional height, an applicant shall provide documentation from a
professional engineer licensed in the State of Illinois showing that the proposed antenna
cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved facility within a one-quarter mile search
for facilities under 50 feet in height for one or more of the following reasons:
The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved
facility, and the existing or approved facility cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to
accommodate the planned equipment at a reasonable cost;
The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting other service
providers, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
An existing or approved facility within the search area cannot accommodate the planned
equipment at a height necessary to provide service to the applicant's service area; or
Other unforeseen reasons make the subject site of practical necessity for the applicant.
Compliance. All wireless service facilities shall maintain compliance with the plans and
specifications approved and made part of the application for the installation of a wireless service
facility. Noncompliance, including but not limited to, discoloration, cracking, missing components,
rusting, settling, damage or general disrepair shall be deemed a violation of this Title and shall
subject the owner of the facility and the owner of a host building or structure, if different, to the
remedies and penalties set forth in this Code. Liability for such noncompliance shall be joint and
several for the owner or owners of a facility and an owner or owners of a host building or structure,
if different.
Abandonment. Abandoned, obsolescent, or unused wireless service facilities or portions thereof
shall be removed within three months of notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations at a site,
unless an extension is granted by the Building Official. In the event that a wireless service facility,
or portion thereof, is not removed within three months of such notice, or other agreed time, the
Village may, in addition to any other remedy provided by this Title, remove the facility or portion
thereof, at the applicant's expense. Unused portions of a wireless service tower above a
manufactured connection shall be removed within two months of the time of antenna relocation.
The replacement of portions of a tower previously removed requires the issuance of a new permit.

Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that rental housing in the Village is decent,
safe and sanitary and is so operated and maintained as not to become a nuisance to the
neighborhood or to become an influence that fosters blight and deterioration or creates a
disincentive to reinvestment in the community. The operation of rental residential properties is a
business enterprise that entails certain responsibilities. Operators are responsible to take such
reasonable steps as are necessary to assure that the citizens of the Village who occupy such units
may pursue the quiet enjoyment of the normal activities of life in surroundings that are: safe,
secure and sanitary; free from noise, nuisances or annoyances; free from unreasonable fears
about safety of persons and security of property, and suitable for raising children.
Responsibilities of owners and occupants. No owner or other person shall occupy or let another
person occupy any building unless it and the premises are clean, sanitary, fit for human
occupancy, and comply with all applicable legal requirements of the State of Illinois and the Village
of Thornton, including the following requirements.
Maintenance of shared or public areas. Every owner of a building shall maintain in a clean,
sanitary and safe condition the shared or public areas of the building and premises thereof.
Maintenance of occupied areas. All occupants of a building shall maintain in a clean, sanitary and
safe condition that part or those parts of the building and premises thereof that they occupy and
control.
One family per dwelling unit. Not more than one family, except for temporary guests, shall occupy
a dwelling unit.
License required. No person, corporation or other entity shall operate one- and two-family rental
dwelling units and multiple-family dwelling units unless he or she or it holds a current, unrevoked
operating license issued by the enforcement authority of the Village of Thornton, in his or her or its
name, for the specifically named or identified one- and two-family rental dwelling unit or units or
multiple-family dwelling units.
License term. Licenses will be issued for a time period according to the license type as indicated
in Diagram I. All licenses may be reviewed at any time after the beginning of the license term to
determine whether the property continues to have the appropriate type license. All licenses expire
on April 30, unless sooner revoked.

New licenses. Properties that have legally not been required to have a rental license due to new
construction or a change from owner-occupied to rental will qualify for a Type II license. Properties
found operating without a valid rental license from the Village or failing to meet Village Code
requirements or that have been the subject of enforcement actions, such as criminal prosecution
or civil penalties for violation of this chapter, will only qualify for a Type III license.
License renewals. All rental properties are subject to review and may be required to apply and
qualify for a different license type based on the level of compliance with Village codes and
applicable regulations.
Failure to meet license category requirements. At any time during a license period, if a rental
property does not meet or exceed the criteria established for the current license type, the license
may be brought forth to the Village Administrator for consideration of license suspension,
revocation, and/or license type review.
Type IV provisional licenses. Rental properties under Type IV provisional licensing must meet the
requirements set forth in § 7-11-3CC.
License category criteria. License type will be determined on the basis of established criteria
based on property inspections, police incidents and property code and nuisance violations.
Period of license. Every operating license shall be issued for a period based on the type of license
issued according to Diagram I. Said license is transferable to a new person, corporation or other
entity on notification to the enforcement authority of intent to transfer, prior to the actual transfer,
and any such license so transferred shall remain in effect until its renewal or termination date,
provided the transferee meets the requirements of this chapter.
Licensing authorized. The Village enforcement authority is hereby authorized, upon application on
forms provided by the enforcement authority, to issue a new operating license or to renew an
existing operating license, in the name of the owner, operator or agent thereof, for the operation of
one- and two-family rental dwelling units or multiple-family dwelling units on presentation by the
applicant of a certificate of compliance issued by the enforcement authority, showing compliance
with the health, safety and maintenance standards set forth in this chapter and dated less than
180 days prior to the date of application.
Inspection and application fees. The following fees must be paid in full at the time of application for
the operating license. In the event that more than one reinspection is required, there will be an
additional fee of $50 per inspection.
For single-family and multifamily units not to exceed two units: $100 per unit.
For multi-unit buildings with three or more units: $100 for the building and $35 per unit
inspected.
Renewal of existing license. Renewal of existing operating licenses must take place at least 60
days prior to the expiration date of said license, and all inspection and application fees shall be
paid. A renewal application made after the expiration date shall be charged a late fee of $100. Any
renewal application without the required certificate of compliance shall be charged a $25 per unit
expediting fee in addition to the regular inspection and application fee.
Residency/registered agent. No license shall be issued or renewed for a nonresident applicant
unless such applicant designates, in writing, on the application form, the name of a registered
agent in the State of Illinois, Counties of Cook, Will, or DuPage, or Lake County, Indiana, for the
receipt of service of any notices or correspondence issued pursuant to the enforcement of this
chapter and for service of process pursuant to this chapter. An applicant shall be considered to be
nonresident when absent from the Village of Thornton for 30 days or more.

shall keep or cause to be kept a written record in the form of a list showing the date and nature of
all repairs, alterations or changes in equipment or systems related to the provisions of this chapter
or to any rules or regulations pertaining thereto, and of all corrections made as a result of
inspections made by the Housing Inspector. Such record shall be made available to the
enforcement authority on request to the holder of said license or their registered agent. Notice is
hereby given that such record may be used in administrative or judicial proceedings pursuant to
this chapter.
Notice of violation. Whenever, upon inspection of any licensed premises or the records required to
be kept under this chapter, a determination by the Housing Inspector or the enforcement authority
indicates a violation of the provisions of this chapter occurs, a notice of violation shall be served in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The notice of violation shall contain a statement
of the specific requirement violated, and a provision for the licensee to correct the violation or
violations in a reasonable time as determined by the enforcement authority, and a statement that
the license is subject to revocation if the corrections do not take place in the time limit stated.
Reinspection and suspension of the license. At the end of the time allowed for correction of the
violation notice or earlier if requested by the license holder, a reinspection of the premises shall
take place to determine if the corrections have taken place. If, on inspection, the corrections have
not taken place, the enforcement authority shall issue an order suspending the operating license.
Appeal of suspension order. An appeal to the enforcement authority appealing the suspension of
an operating license must be in writing and submitted to the enforcement authority by the license
holder or their agent within 10 days of the issue of the suspension order. Failure to correct
violations and failure to appeal the suspension as provided herein shall result in the revocation of
said license.
Reinstatement of suspended or revoked license. A suspended or revoked operator's license for
the operation of one- and two-family rental dwelling units or multiple-family dwelling units shall be
reinstated only on reinspection showing all cited violations have been corrected.
Conviction. If a license holder or occupant or tenant is found guilty in a court of competent
jurisdiction of any violation of the ordinances of the Village of Thornton or the laws of the United
States or the State of Illinois in connection with the licensed premises, then the license shall be
subject to revocation without further notice.
Extremely hazardous conditions. In the event a condition of extreme hazard or imminent danger to
the occupants or general public is found to exist on or in licensed premises, the Housing Inspector
or the enforcement authority may immediately revoke the license and issue a notice of violation
without a time limit to correct the hazardous condition; and order evacuation of the premises if, in
the inspector's opinion, evacuation is necessary to protect the occupants.
Separate violation. Each item contained in a notice of violation may be considered a separate
violation of this chapter, and each day that a violation exists from the date of discovery and the
date of correction shall be considered a separate violation of the chapter and subject to the fines
set herein.
Transfer of cited property. It is unlawful for the owner of any premises who has received
compliance orders or upon whom a notice of violation has been served to sell, transfer, mortgage,
lease or otherwise dispose of, to another party, the so-cited property until the provisions of the
compliance order or notice of violation have been complied with, or until such owner shall furnish
to the grantee, mortgagor or lessee a true copy of any compliance or notice of violation, issued by
the enforcement authority, or shall furnish to the enforcement authority a signed and notarized
statement from the grantee, transferee, mortgagor, or lessee acknowledging the receipt of such

compliance order or notice of violation and fully accepting the responsibility without condition for
making the corrections or repairs required by such compliance order or notice of violation.
Any owner, agent or designee of rented property is required to utilize a nuisance-free lease
addendum or have a clause in the lease similar to a nuisance-free lease addendum for any leases
executed after October 1, 2006. The Village Clerk shall provide at no cost samples of the
nuisance-free lease addendum and shall review any clauses within actual leases with the Village
Legal Department to determine if the clause is similar to the nuisance-free lease addendum. The
clause is to make criminal activity (not limited to violent criminal activity or drug-related criminal
activity engaged by, facilitated by or permitted by the renter, a member of the household, guest or
other party under the control of the renter) a lease violation. The landlord shall have authority
under that clause to initiate an eviction proceeding as specified in the Illinois Compiled Statutes
forcible entry and detainer statutes. Proof of criminal violation shall be by a preponderance of the
evidence.
Type IV provisional licenses.
Rental properties that meet the provisional licensing criteria as described in § 7-11-3 are
eligible only for provisional licenses.
The Village enforcement authority will provide by registered mail to each licensee a monthly
report of any police and fire calls and incidents and applicable property Code violations.
Mitigation plan. The applicant for a provisional license must submit for Village enforcement
authority review a mitigation plan for the license period. The mitigation plan shall describe
steps proposed by the applicant to reduce the number of police and fire calls and/or the
property code issues to a level that qualifies for a Type I or II license. The mitigation plan may
include such steps as changes in tenant screening procedures, changes in lease terms,
security measures, rules and regulations for tenant conduct, security personnel, and time
frame to implement all phases of the Crime-Free Housing Program.
Village consideration. The application with a proposed mitigation plan will be presented to the
Village enforcement authority. After giving the applicant an opportunity to be heard and
present evidence, the Village enforcement authority shall approve, disapprove, or approve
with conditions the application and the mitigation plan. If the Village enforcement authority
disapproves an application and mitigation plan or approves it with conditions, it shall state its
reasons for so doing in writing. In evaluating a mitigation plan, the Village enforcement
authority will consider, among other things, the facility, its management practices, the nature
and seriousness of causes for police and fire incidences and/or property code issues, and the
expected effectiveness of measures identified in the plan to reduce the number of police and
fire incidences and/or property code violations. In evaluating a mitigation plan submitted by an
applicant already under a provisional license, the Village enforcement authority will also
consider the effectiveness of measures identified in the applicant's previous mitigation plan
and the need for different or additional measures to reduce police and fire incidences and/or
property code violations.
Compliance with mitigation plan. The licensee shall comply with the mitigation plan as
approved or modified by the Village enforcement authority. No later than the 10th day after
each calendar month, the licensee shall mail or deliver to the Village enforcement authority a
written report describing all steps taken in furtherance of the mitigation plan during the
preceding month.

provisions of § 7-11-2 once each year (unless a Type 1 residential license is issued) for the

licensing inspection.
On first application, each rental unit requiring inspection under this chapter shall be inspected

receipt of a documented complaint as to a condition not complaint to the property
maintenance standards.
Multiple rental dwellings (i.e., apartments). Inspections of multiple dwellings shall be performed
annually, with the units to be inspected chosen at random. The number of dwellings required to be

common areas equal six or more violations, 100% of the dwelling units must be inspected
within 60 days of the current inspection.
Thorncreek Senior Living exemption. Thorncreek is exempt from dwelling inspections due to
county, state, and federal requirements and inspections.
Single-family rental dwellings. An inspection of a single-family rental dwelling shall be performed
at least every other year.
If the number of violations found on the premises equals three or fewer, the property qualifies
for a Type I license (two-year period).
If the number of violations found on the premises equals four or more, the premises must be
inspected within the next twelve-month period (Type II license).
The Village enforcement authority or his designee shall conduct annual inspections of common
areas of multiple dwellings. The inspection of the common area shall include, but is not limited to,
all hallways, stairways, lobbies, utility rooms, laundry rooms, storage rooms, recreation rooms,
grounds, refuse areas, parking areas, building extensions, signs and other areas designed for
common use by dwelling unit occupants. Such inspections are for the purpose of enforcing this

or abate the emergency. If circumstances warrant, the Housing Inspector may act to correct or abate
the emergency.
Notice served. Immediately after the violation is corrected by the Housing Inspector under the
procedure described in the above paragraph, the Inspector's supervising authority, or their
designee, shall serve or cause to be served a copy of the order on the owner or manager,
pursuant to the procedures outlined in this chapter.
Order. The order issued under this section of this chapter shall:
Contain a description of the dwelling sufficient to identify and locate it;
Set out the particulars of the violation and the reasons why such violation constituted an
urgent hazard to the health and safety of any person;
Have appended thereto a statement from the Inspector setting out the measures taken by the
Village and the amount expended by the Village in so doing; and
Contain notice of the appellate procedures contained in this chapter.
Recovery of costs. When repairs are made or other corrective action taken at the direction of the
Housing Inspector, the cost of such repairs and corrective action shall constitute a debt in favor of
the Village of Thornton against the owner of the repaired structure. In the event such owner fails,
neglects or refuses to pay the Village of Thornton the amount of this debt, it shall be recoverable
in a civil action against the owner or his successor, brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by
the Village of Thornton, which shall possess all rights of a private creditor, or any other means of
collection available to municipal corporations as set forth in the Illinois State Statutes.
Liens. In addition to other methods of recovery, the cost of repair or other corrective action
incurred by the Village is recoverable from the owner or owners of such real estate and is a lien
thereon, which lien is superior to all prior existing liens and encumbrances, except taxes; provided
that, within 60 days after such repair or corrective action, the Village shall file a notice of lien of
such costs and expenses incurred in the office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. The notice
of lien must consist of a supporting statement setting out:
A description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof;
The amount of money representing the cost; and
The date or dates when the cost and expense were incurred by the Village.
Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner of or persons interested in the property, after
a notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the Village, and the release may be
recorded with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. As in the case of filing a notice of lien, the lien
may be enforced by proceedings to foreclosure as in the case of mortgages or mechanic's liens.
Suit to foreclosure of such lien must be commenced within three years after the date of filing a
notice of lien.
§ 7-11-8. Appellate procedures.

Chapter 7-13. Control of Post-Construction Stormwater
Runoff
§ 7-13-1. Findings of fact.
[4-3-2006]
It is hereby determined that:
Land development projects alter the hydraulic response of local watersheds and increase
storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposition;
This storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants, and;
Storm water runoff, soil erosion and non-point-source pollution can be controlled and
minimized through the regulation of storm water runoff from development sites.
Therefore, the Village of Thornton establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies
applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water
runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that
the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and other
construction activities in order to control and minimize increased in storm water runoff rates and
volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and non-point-source pollution associated with
storm water runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
§ 7-13-2. Purpose.
[4-3-2006]
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum storm water management requirements and
controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in
watersheds within this jurisdiction. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
Minimize increases in storm water runoff form any development in order to reduce flooding,
siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion, and maintain the integrity of
stream channels.
Minimize pollution caused by storm water runoff from development that would otherwise degrade
local water quality.
Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that flows from any specific site during
the following development to not exceed the predevelopment hydrologic regime to the maximum
extent practicable.
Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and pollution, wherever possible,
through storm water management controls and to ensure that these management controls are
properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety.

This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivisions or site plan applications, unless eligible for an
exemption or granted a waiver by the Village under the specifications of § 7-13-4 of this chapter.
The chapter also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum
applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets
the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development
activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
To prevent the adverse impacts of storm water runoff, the Village has developed a set of
performance standards that must be met at new development sites, if determined to be applicable
by the Village. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one acre or more of
land. The following activities may be exempt from these storm water performance criteria:
Additions or modifications to existing single-family structures.
Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land, provided that they are not part
of a larger common development plan.
Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by the Village.
When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in
§ 7-13-2 of this chapter, decisions on permitting shall be determined by the Building Commissioner
and on-site storm water requirements shall be determined by the Village Engineer. This
determination shall be dependent upon the amount of impervious area created by the
redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects
will be determined after a review by the Village.
§ 7-13-4. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance
requirements.
[4-3-2006]
This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annual any other chapter, rule or regulation,
statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum
requirements, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other chapter, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are
more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be
considered to take precedence.
§ 7-13-5. Severability.
[4-3-2006]
If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter
shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order or judgment shall not affect or
invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this
chapter.

Permit Required. No land owner or land operator shall receive any of the building, grading or other
land development permits required for land disturbance activities of one acre or more without first
meeting the requirements of this chapter prior to commencing the proposed activity.
Application Requirements.
Unless specifically excluded by this chapter, any land owner or operator desiring a permit for
a land disturbance activity shall submit to the Village a permit application.
Unless otherwise exempted by this chapter, a permit application must be accompanied by the
following in order that the permit application be considered: a storm water management
concept plan and a maintenance agreement.
The storm water management plan shall be prepared to meet the requirements of § 7-13-5 of
this chapter.
Application Procedure. Applications for land disturbance activity permits must be accompanied by
four sets of plans submitted to the Building Commissioner.
§ 7-13-8. Waivers to storm water management requirements.
[4-3-2006]
Waiver of Eligibility Criteria.
Every applicant shall provide for storm water management as required by this chapter, unless
this requirement is waived by the Village.
The minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in whole or in part
upon request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment
of the objectives of this chapter.
Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm water discharges
have been established in a storm water management plan that has been approved by the
Village and the implementation of the plan is required by local chapter.
Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is
required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm
water control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site
practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and
maintenance of the storm water practice.
The Village finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirement is not
feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of the site.
Non-structural practices will be used on the sites that reduce: a) the generation of storm
water from the site, b) the size and cost of storm water storage, and c) the pollutants
generated at the site. These non-structural practices are explained in detail in the Illinois
Urban Manual.
Assurances Required for Waiver. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the
Village may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these storm water management provisions,
as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance,
the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Village that the variance will not result in
the following impacts to downstream waterway.

§ 7-13-9. General performance criteria for storm water
management.
[4-3-2006]
Unless judged by the Village to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall
be addressed for storm water management at all sites:
All site designs shall, to the maximum extent possible, establish storm water management
practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with specified design
storms and reduce the generation of storm water runoff. These practices should seek to utilize
previous areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical.
To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel protection criterion shall be
provided as prescribed in the Illinois Urban Manual.
Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a storm water pollution prevention
plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan
requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the Village to determine if they are subject
to additional storm water design requirements.
The calculations for determining peak flows as required by the MWRDGC shall be used for sizing
all storm water management practices where applicable.
§ 7-13-10. Basic storm water management design criteria.
[4-3-2006]
Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture storm water runoff pollutants. In
particular, designers shall give preference to wet bottom and wetland designs in locations adjacent
to or near existing wetlands or in other areas where they are suitable and acceptable to the Village
and all flows from the development shall be routed through the basin.
Dry basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in certain developments to enhance multiple
uses where suitable and acceptable to the Village. Retention and infiltration of storm water shall
be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water
runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.
The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered
compatible with storm water management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat,
recreation, wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should try to avoid using portions
of the property exclusively for storm water management.

Intent. In enacting this chapter, the Village intends to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in
the Village and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing
uniform standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public
ways and places;
Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are
hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the Village's utilities and of other
utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or public property;
Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of
utility facilities;
Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and materials that increase
impermeable surfaces;
Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed;
Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that characterize the Village's
residential neighborhoods;
Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-way; and
Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities
locations.
Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon,
under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired and
operated by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided
in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The Village, in its discretion and as limited by law,
may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of
locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village rights-ofway.
Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the
Village enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the Village may provide for terms
and conditions inconsistent with this chapter.
Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.

telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar agreement with the Village,
such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the
provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement
between the Village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and
any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or parts of chapters adopted
prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.

documentation, shall be examined by the Village Engineer within a reasonable time after filing. If
the application does not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the Village Engineer shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons
therefor. If the Village Engineer is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of
this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Engineer
shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications Retailers.
Pursuant to § 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer
shall notify the Village that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities
for the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of
the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the Village not less
than 10 days prior to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than
30 days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Village Engineer shall
specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and
constructed.
In the event that the Village Engineer fails to provide such specification of location to the
telecommunications retailer within either (i) 10 days after service of notice to the Village by
the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new
construction or (ii) 25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the
case of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a permit is required for work
pursuant to § 8-5-4 of this chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village
an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements
of Subsection A of this section.
Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State Authorization Under the Cable and
Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45
days after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon by the Village, provided the
holder has complied with applicable Village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
§ 8-5-6. Effect of permit.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
Authority Granted. No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit from the Village
authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this chapter on
Village rights-of-way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than six months
unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion.

Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under
this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who
will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with such Village
representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the
purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary
in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property
owners.
Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse the
permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and all applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations.
§ 8-5-7. Revised permit drawings.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations
identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee
shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within 90 days after the completion of the
permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the
actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in
accordance with § 8-5-21 of this chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms
to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
§ 8-5-8. Insurance.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall

If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors
performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section.
Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of
primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess
coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by
the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to
the Village within 10 days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies required by this section
shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to
renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village President of such intent to cancel or
not to renew."
Within 10 days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event later than 10 days prior
to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit
requirements required by Subsection A of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to
the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under Subsection A, or the requirements of Subsections B, C and D of this section. A
utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
Subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the
Workers Compensation Act.
Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The legal liability of the utility to the
Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or selfinsurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance
or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be affected under valid
and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in
the State of Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and
of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.
§ 8-5-9. Indemnification.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be deemed to agree to defend,
indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense,
arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed
or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that
the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands,

§ 8-5-10. Security.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in
this section. The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at
the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter;
Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the permittee's failure
to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the
Village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the
Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation
of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work
the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all
other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other
applicable law.
Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at the permittee's
election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of
credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to
this subsection shall, at a minimum:
Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the permittee;
Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of any amounts
covered by it; and
Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of Illinois at which it can
be drawn.
Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably
estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to
the construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Engineer, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the
permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting
of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction
in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the
previous phase or phases, the Village Engineer may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this
Subsection C for any single phase.
Withdrawals. The Village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and
its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within
the fourteen-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the Village
has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the
permittee; or
Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village determines can be remedied
by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has
been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the
amount specified in Subsection C of this section.
Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the
Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal
to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the
minimum balance required in Subsection C of this section.
Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit,
the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as
remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or
other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and
all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the
permittee.
Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the Security Fund are in
addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized
by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall
affect any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be

without adversely affecting safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, selfsupporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever practicable; the
installation of additional utility poles is strongly discouraged.
Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway structures only where the
utility has demonstrated that all other means of accommodating the facility are not
practicable. Other means shall include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater,
independent pole, cable support and tower supports, all of which are completely separated
from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure or potential,
present high degrees of risk and such installations are not permitted.
A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility installation on a bridge or
roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing.
Approval or disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:
The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be transmitted and an
evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in the event of damage to or
failure of the facility;
The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway structure in the
transportation system;
The alternative routings available to the utility and their comparative practicability;
The proposed method of attachment;
The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the proposed facility;
The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared to the risk involved.
Appearance Standards.
The Village may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular locations in order to preserve
visual quality.
A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require extensive removal or
alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents
and property owners, and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being
traversed.

trench at any time unless special permission is obtained from the Village Engineer.
Open Trench and Excavated Material. Open trench and windrowed excavated material
shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between
the roadway and the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed
to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow
for windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated
material shall be hauled to an off-road location.
Drip Line of Trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip line of any tree designated
by the Village to be preserved.
Backfilling.
Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of facilities shall be backfilled
for its full width, depth, and length using methods and materials in accordance with
IDOT's "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction." When excavated
material is hauled away or is unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be
used.
For a period of three years from the date construction of a facility is completed, the utility
shall be responsible to remove and restore any backfilled area that has settled due to
construction of the facility. If so ordered by the Engineer (Director of Public Works), the
utility, at its expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the
installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new
pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the
Engineer (Director of Public Works).

For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a concrete surface/base in the
last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three years, permits shall not be issued unless
such work is determined to be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary
and unforeseen before the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is
necessary for a J.U.L.I.E. locate.
Encasement.
Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the highway and any other
superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either by one-piece fabrication or by
welding or jointed installation approved by the Village.
The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-ofway
line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be located in the area established as clear
zone for that particular section of the highway.
In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall be furnished between
bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village approved jointed pipe is used under the
roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed prior to highway construction and
carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell
and spigot type pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may be eliminated.
In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with installations of more
than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if: (1) extra heavy pipe is used that
precludes future maintenance or repair and (2) cathodic protection of the pipe is
provided;
If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products pipeline, the facility shall be
located so as to provide that construction does not disrupt the right-of-way.

Operational Restrictions.
Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of the Village, be required to
be discontinued when such operations would create hazards to traffic or the public health,
safety, and welfare. Such operations may also be required to be discontinued or restricted
when conditions are such that construction would result in extensive damage to the right-ofway
or other property.
These restrictions may be waived by the Engineer (Director of Public Works) when
emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.
Unless otherwise permitted by the Village, the hours of construction are those set [regular
hours as set by the Village.]
Location of Existing Facilities. Any utility proposing to construct facilities in the Village shall contact
J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain the presence and location of existing above-ground and underground
facilities within the rights-of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The Village will make its
permit records available to a utility for the purpose of identifying possible facilities. When notified
of an excavation or when requested by the Village or by J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and
physically mark its underground facilities within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in
accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et

Electric Utilities. Compliance with State Laws and Regulations. An electric utility shall conduct all
tree-trimming and vegetation control activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable
Illinois laws and regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement with the
Village as permitted by law.
Other Utilities. Tree Trimming Permit Required. Tree trimming that is done by any other utility with
facilities in the right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and
regulations specifically governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation,
but shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit
required under this chapter.
Application for Tree Trimming Permit. Applications for tree trimming permits shall include
assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are
experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
Damage to Trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or misshapen trees will not be
tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment
of damages. The Village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for
trees removed without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees or
unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the removal and replacement of trees
if trimming or radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.
Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The Village may require that special measures
be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special significance. The required measures may
consist of higher poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
Chemical Use.
Except as provided in the following subsection, no utility shall spray, inject or pour any
chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation in the Village for any purpose, including
the control of growth, insects or disease.
Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be permitted on rights-of-way unless
the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Engineer (Director of Public Works) that such
spraying is the only practicable method of vegetation control.
§ 8-5-18. Removal, relocation, or modifications of utility facilities.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the Village, a utility shall, at its own expense,
protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within 30 days following written notice from the Village, any
utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within
the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the
following circumstances:

required;
If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in
violation of this chapter; or
If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license
or franchise.
Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the right and privilege to cut or
move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the Village, as the Village may determine to
be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or
removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.
Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the Village,
the utility shall notify the Village within 90 days. Following receipt of such notice the Village may
direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Village Engineer determines that
such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that
the Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of
abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
§ 8-5-19. Cleanup and restoration.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other property within 10
days after any portion of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the Village. This includes restoration of entrances
and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved
by the Village Engineer. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading,
reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period provided in
this section may be extended by the Village Engineer for good cause shown.
§ 8-5-20. Maintenance and emergency maintenance.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be
maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.
Emergency Maintenance Procedures. Emergencies may justify noncompliance with normal
procedures for securing a permit:
If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall
take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the
public on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard
does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the
parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights
shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when
no other means of access to the facility is available.

In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the Village Engineer or his or her
duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been
taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic,
the Village police shall be notified immediately.
In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as
practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public.
Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the Village a description of the repairs
undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after an emergency repair.
§ 8-5-21. Variances.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the provisions of this
chapter must do so in writing to the Village Engineer as a part of the permit application. The
request shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
Authority to Grant Variances. The Village Engineer shall decide whether a variance is authorized
for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Village Engineer may authorize a variance only if the
utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an
irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the
provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the
provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested
approach.
Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the
Village Engineer may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and
conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination,
including denial of a variance, made by the Village Engineer under the provisions of this chapter
shall have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within 30
days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall
commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide
the appeal.
§ 8-5-22. Penalties.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of
this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may
be times when the Village will incur delay or other costs, including third-party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless the utility shows that

another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear
the Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission
may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed
upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
§ 8-5-23. Enforcement.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the Village
may have for enforcement of this chapter.
§ 8-5-24. Severability.
[Amended 10-15-2007(1)]
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter is for any reason held
invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.
Chapter 8-6. Vacation of Streets and Alleys
§ 8-6-1. Determination; procedures.
[8-3-2015]
Upon the Village Board's determination that the public interest will be served thereby, the Village
Board may adopt an ordinance to vacate a street or alley or a part thereof, upon an affirmative
vote of 2/3 of the Trustees then holding office, but at least four votes are required, during a regular
or special Village Board meeting. Notice of the meeting and subject matter of the ordinance to be
considered shall be in accordance with the Illinois Open Meetings Act.[1] The ordinance may
provide that it shall not become effective until the owners of all property or the owners of a
particular parcel or parcels of property abutting upon the street or alley, or part thereof so vacated,
shall pay compensation in an amount which, in the judgment of the Village Board, shall be the fair
market value of the property acquired or of the benefits which will accrue to them by reason of that
vacation. If there are any public service facilities in such street or alley, or part thereof, the
ordinance may also reserve to the Village or to the public utility, as the case may be, owning such
facilities such property, rights-of-way and easements as, in the judgment of the Village Board, are
necessary or desirable for continuing public service by means of those facilities and for the
maintenance, renewal and reconstruction thereof. If the ordinance provides that only the owner or
owners of one particular parcel of abutting property shall make payment, then the owner or
owners of the particular parcel shall acquire title to the entire vacated street or alley, or the part
thereof vacated.
Editor's Note: See 5 ILCS 120/1 et seq.
The determination of the Village Board that the nature and extent of the public use or public
interest to be subserved is such as to warrant the vacation of any street or alley, or part thereof, is
conclusive, and the passage of such an ordinance is sufficient evidence of that determination,
whether so recited in the ordinance or not. The relief to the public from further burden or
responsibility of maintaining any street or alley, or part thereof, constitutes a public use or public
interest authorizing the vacation.

Obedience to devices. The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official trafficcontrol
device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the provisions of this Title, unless
otherwise directed by a police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Title.
Traffic-control signal legend. Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights successively one at a time, in combination or with arrows, the following
colors only shall be used and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and
pedestrians as follows:
Green Alone or "Go":
Vehicular traffic facing the signal indication may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such
signal indication is illuminated.
Pedestrians facing the signal indication may proceed across the roadway within any
marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Green With Green Arrow:
Vehicular traffic facing such signal indications may proceed straight through or turn right
or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic within a
lane designated and restricted as a turning lane only shall enter an intersection only to
make the movement indicated by such arrow when it is illuminated and shall yield the
right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using
the intersection.
Pedestrians facing such signal indications may proceed across the roadway within any
marked or unmarked crosswalk.
Yellow or "Caution" When Shown With or Following the Green or "Go" Signal:
Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the
intersection, but if such stop cannot be made in safety, a vehicle may be driven
cautiously through the intersection.
No pedestrian facing such signal indications shall enter the roadway until the green or
"Go" signal indication is illuminated alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian
"Walk" signal indication.
Yellow or "Caution" When Illuminated in Combination With the Red or "Stop" Signal
Indication:
Vehicular traffic facing the signal indications is thereby informed that the green or "Go"
signal indication will be illuminated immediately thereafter and such vehicular traffic shall
remain standing until the green or "Go" signal indication is illuminated alone.
No pedestrian facing such signal indications shall enter the roadway until green or "Go"
signal indication is illuminated alone unless authorized so to do by a pedestrian "Walk"

Red or "Stop":
Vehicular traffic facing the signal indication shall stop before entering the intersection at a
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such marking shall stop at the signal device and shall remain standing until the green
or "Go" signal indication is illuminated alone.
No pedestrian facing such signal indication shall enter the roadway unless he can do so
safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
Red With Green Arrow or Green Arrow Alone:
Vehicular traffic facing such signal indications may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within the crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.
No pedestrian facing such signal indications or indication shall enter the roadway until the
green or "Go" signal indication is illuminated alone unless authorized so to do by a
pedestrian "Walk" signal indication.
Application of Provisions. In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be
applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any
stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the
signal.
Flashing signals. Whenever flashing red or yellow signal indications are used, they shall require
obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
Flashing Red (Stop Signal Indication). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent
flashes, the operator of any vehicle shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an
intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if none, then before entering the intersection at
the signal, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal Indication). When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, the operator of any vehicle may proceed through the intersection or past
such signal only with caution.
Avoidance of signals. No operator of a vehicle shall attempt to avoid obedience to any trafficcontrol
device or traffic-control signal by driving upon or through any private property, any alley or
any traffic island.
Traffic lanes. Where traffic lanes have been marked to preserve a regular alignment of traffic, it
shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to fail or refuse to keep his vehicle within the
designated boundaries of any such lane except when lawfully passing another vehicle.
Application to trucks. Whenever official signs are erected prohibiting the use of any street or part
of a street by trucks or other commercial vehicles or imposing set limitations upon such vehicles
using said street or part of a street as authorized herein, no person shall drive a truck or other
commercial vehicle upon any such street or part of a street in violation of any such signs, except
for the purpose of delivering or picking up materials or merchandise, and then only by entering
such street at the intersection nearest the destination of the vehicle and proceeding thereon no
farther than the nearest intersection thereafter.

directions of any such sign.
Signals Required.
No person shall turn a vehicle from a direct course upon a roadway unless and until such
movement can be made with reasonable safety and then only after giving an appropriate
signal in the manner herein provided in the event any other vehicle may be affected by such
movement.
A signal of intention to turn right or left shall be given during not less than the last 100 feet
traveled by the vehicle before turning.
No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of a vehicle without first giving an
appropriate signal in the manner provided herein to the driver of any vehicle immediately to
the rear when there is opportunity to give such signal.

Authorized emergency vehicles.
Upon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle operated as a police or
fire vehicle giving audible signal by siren, exhaust whistle or bell or when such vehicle is
equipped with at least one lighted lamp displaying an oscillating, rotating or flashing beam, or
upon the immediate approach of any other authorized emergency vehicle giving audible
signal by siren, exhaust whistle or bell and when such other vehicle is equipped with at least
one lighted lamp displaying an oscillating, rotating or flashing beam visible under normal
atmospheric conditions from a distance of 500 feet to the front of such vehicle, the driver of
every other vehicle shall yield the right of way and shall immediately drive to a position
parallel to, and as close as possible to, the right-hand edge of curb, except on "one-way"
streets where drivers shall drive as close as possible to nearest edge or curb of the roadway
clear of any intersection and shall stop and remain in such position until the authorized
emergency vehicle has passed, except when otherwise directed by a police officer or a
fireman in the lawful exercise of his duty as provided in this Title.
This section shall not operate to relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from
the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway.
No person shall drive or move any vehicle or equipment upon any highway with any lamp or
device thereon displaying a red light visible from directly in front thereof. This subsection shall
not apply to authorized emergency vehicles. No person other than members of Municipal
Police and Fire Departments shall drive any vehicle displaying a blue light thereon. Flashing
lights are prohibited on motor vehicles, except as a means for indicating a right or left turn.
Intersections.
Marked and Posted Intersections. When stop signs or flashing red signals are in place at an
intersection or at a plainly marked crosswalk between intersections, drivers of vehicles shall
stop before entering the nearest crosswalk and pedestrians within or entering the crosswalk
at either edge of the roadway shall have the right of way over vehicles so stopped. Drivers of
vehicles having so yielded the right of way to pedestrians entering or within the nearest
crosswalk at an intersection shall also yield the right of way to pedestrians within any other
crosswalk at the intersection.
Unmarked Intersections.
The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right of way to a vehicle
which has entered the intersection from a different roadway.
When two vehicles enter an intersection from different streets at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right of way to the vehicle on the
right.
The right of way regulations as provided in subsections B1 and B2 are modified at
intersections and entries to roadways where posted signs regulate the right of way as
provided elsewhere in this Title.
Blocking Intersections. No operator of a vehicle shall enter an intersection or crosswalk
unless there is sufficient space beyond such intersection or crosswalk in the direction which

such vehicle is proceeding to accommodate the vehicle without obstructing the passage of
other vehicular traffic or pedestrians, notwithstanding any traffic-control signal indication to
proceed.
Stop signs. When stop signs are erected as herein provided at or near the entrance to any
intersection, every operator of a vehicle shall stop such vehicle at such sign or at a clearly marked
stop line before entering the intersection except when directed to proceed by a police officer.
Entrance to through street.
After the operator of a vehicle has stopped at the entrance to a through street, such operator
shall yield the right of way to other vehicles which have entered the intersection from said
through street or which are approaching so closely on said through street as to constitute an
immediate hazard, but said operator having so yielded may proceed and the operators of all
other vehicles approaching the intersection on said through street shall yield the right of way
to the vehicles so proceeding into or across the through street.
After the operator of a vehicle has stopped in obedience to a stop sign, at an intersection
where a stop sign is erected at one or more entrances thereto although not a part of a through
street, such operator shall proceed cautiously yielding to vehicles not so obliged to stop which
are within the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard, but
may then proceed.
Emerging from alley, driveway or building. The driver of a vehicle emerging from an alley, driveway
or building shall stop such vehicle immediately prior to driving onto a sidewalk or onto the sidewalk
area extending across an alleyway, yielding the right of way to any pedestrian as may be
necessary to avoid collision, and upon entering the roadway shall yield the right of way to all
vehicles approaching on said roadway.
Yield right of way. Where preference is given to traffic through any intersection on any roadway
and specified entrances to said intersection are designated as yield right of way entrances by the
erection of yield right of way signs, the driver of a vehicle in obedience to a yield right of way sign
shall slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions or shall stop if necessary and
shall yield the right of way to other vehicles which have entered the intersecting roadway either
from the right or left or which are approaching so closely on said intersecting roadway as to
constitute an immediate hazard, but said driver having so yielded may proceed at such time as a
safe interval occurs.
Pedestrians
When the movement of traffic is not controlled by official traffic-control signals or a police
officer, the driver of a vehicle shall yield the right of way, slowing down or stopping if need be
to so yield, to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within a crosswalk when the pedestrian is
upon the half of the roadway upon which the vehicle is traveling, or when the pedestrian is
approaching so closely from the opposite half of the roadway as to be in danger.
Whenever any vehicle is stopped at a marked crosswalk or at any unmarked crosswalk at an
intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross the roadway, the driver of any other vehicle
approaching from the rear shall not overtake and pass such stopped vehicle.
Whenever stop signs or flashing red signals are in place at an intersection or at a plainly
marked crosswalk between intersections, pedestrians shall have the right of way over drivers
of vehicles.
Blind persons.
Any blind person who is carrying in a raised or extended position a cane or walking stick
which is white in color or white tipped with red, or who is being guided by a dog, shall have

The driver of every vehicle approaching the place where a blind person, so carrying such a
cane or walking stick or being so guided, is crossing a roadway shall bring his vehicle to a full
stop and before proceeding shall take such precautions as may be necessary to avoid injury
to the blind person.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to a blind person who is not so carrying such a
cane or walking stick or who is not guided by a dog, but the other provisions of this Title
relating to pedestrians shall then be applicable to such person.
Funeral processions.
Identification.
All motor vehicles participating in a funeral procession, when proceeding to any place of
burial, shall display illuminated headlamps thereon and shall carry on the right-hand side
of the windshield thereof a card, which shall be white in color and upon which shall be
printed, stamped or stained a purple cross or star, the extremities of which shall extend to
the edge of such card.
It shall be the duty of the undertaker having charge of a funeral procession to supply
each motor vehicle in such procession with a card as described herein.
Right of Way.
All motor vehicles so designated shall have the right of way over all other vehicles,
except fire apparatus, ambulances and police vehicles, at any roadway intersection
within the Village and may proceed through stop streets or signalized intersections with
proper caution and safety.

a funeral or other authorized procession except when otherwise directed by a police
officer. This provision shall not apply to authorized emergency vehicles as defined in this
chapter.

herein provided, shall pass each other to the right and upon roadways having width for not more
than one line of traffic in each direction. Each driver shall give to the other at least 1/2 of the main
traveled portion of the roadway as nearly as possible.
§ 9-3-3. Overtaking vehicles.
[8-2-1966]
Passing on the Left. The following rules shall govern the overtaking and passing of vehicles
proceeding in the same direction, subject to those limitations, exceptions and special rules
hereinafter stated:
The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass
to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway
until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle.

Passing on the Right.
The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of another vehicle only under
the following conditions:
When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn, providing there is
sufficient safe clearance distance between the turning vehicle and the right edge of the
roadway.
Upon any roadway with unobstructed pavement not occupied by parked vehicles of
sufficient width for two or more lanes of moving vehicles in each direction.
Upon a one-way street, or upon any roadway on which traffic is restricted to one direction
of movement, where the roadway is free from obstructions and of sufficient width for two
or more lanes of moving vehicles.
The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle upon the right only under
conditions permitting such movement in safety. In no event shall such movement be made by
driving off the pavement or main-traveled portion of the roadway.
Passing Left of Center. No vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the center of the roadway in
overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction unless such left side is
clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such
overtaking and passing to be completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any
vehicle approaching from the opposite direction of any vehicle overtaken. In every event the
overtaking vehicle must return to the right-hand side of the roadway before coming within 200 feet
of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.
Keeping to the Right.
All vehicles shall be driven in the right-hand lane available for traffic or as close as practicable
to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway:
When proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under
the conditions then existing.
When designed and used for transportation, pulling or hauling of freight, except when
overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when
preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway.
Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven in the right-hand lane available
for traffic, except as follows:
When the right half of a roadway is closed to traffic while under construction or repair;
Upon a roadway divided into three marked lanes for traffic under the rules applicable
thereon; or
Upon a roadway designated and sign posted for one-way traffic.
Approaching or Passing School Bus.
The driver of a vehicle upon a roadway, upon meeting or overtaking from either direction any
school bus which has stopped on the highway for the purpose of receiving or discharging any
school children, shall stop the vehicle before reaching the school bus when there is in
operation on the school bus a visual sign as specified by law, and the driver shall not proceed
until the school bus resumes motion, or is signaled by the school bus driver to proceed, or the
visual signals are no longer actuated.

Every bus used for the transportation of school children shall bear upon the front and rear
thereof plainly visible signs containing the works "School Bus" in letters not less than eight
inches high, and in addition shall be equipped with visual signals meeting the requirements of
law, which shall be actuated by the driver of the school bus whenever the brakes are applied.
Such visual signals shall be actuated by the driver at a distance of not less than 100 feet
immediately preceding the point at which the bus stops for the purpose of loading or
discharging passengers.
Approaching Stopped Vehicle. Whenever any vehicle is stopped at a marked crosswalk or at any
unmarked crosswalk at an intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross the roadway, the driver of
any other vehicle approaching from the rear shall not over take or pass such stopped vehicle.
§ 9-3-4. Speed limits.
[8-2-1966]
Driving in Excess of Speed Limit. No person shall drive any vehicle upon any street or public
highway in the Village at a speed which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to
traffic conditions and the use of the way or endangers the safety of any person or property.
Minimum Speed Regulations. No person shall drive a motor vehicle at such a slow speed as to
impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic except when reduced speed is
necessary for safe operation of his vehicle or in compliance with law.
Right to Establish Speed Limits. The Village Board may from time to time establish speed limits
applicable to particular streets or portions of streets. It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of
Streets to install and maintain appropriate signs, signals or markings on such streets or portions of
streets, giving notice of the allowable speed, and it shall be a misdemeanor to exceed the
maximum speed so indicated.
Use of Due Care. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum
speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching a hill
crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when special hazard exists with
respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speed
shall be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or
entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due
care.
Violation. In every charge of violation of this section by failure to observe an applicable speed limit,
the complaint and also the summons or notice to appear shall specify the speed at which the
defendant is alleged to have driven, and the speed limit which is applicable at the place of the
alleged violation.
§ 9-3-5. Riding bicycles, animals, motorcycles.
[8-2-1966]
Bicycles or Animals. Every person riding a bicycle or an animal or driving any animal drawing a
vehicle upon a roadway shall be subject to the provisions of this Title applicable to the driver of a
vehicle except those provisions of this Title which by their nature can have no application.
Motorcycles or Motor-Driven Cycles. A person operating a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle shall
ride only upon the permanent and regular seat attached thereto, and such operator shall not carry

For the purpose of this section, "drag racing" means the act of two or more persons in two or more
motor vehicles competing or racing on any street or public way or in any private or public parking
lot in a situation in which one of the motor vehicles is beside or to the rear of a motor vehicle
operated by a competing driver and one driver attempts to prevent the other driver from passing or
overtaking him. Speed and manner of driving alone shall be sufficient evidence of the violation of
this section and it shall not be necessary to prove that one of the drivers so involved attempted to

intoxicating liquor, evidence of the amount of alcohol in the person's blood at the time of the act
alleged as shown by a chemical analysis of his breath, blood, urine, saliva or other bodily
substance is admissible, and the result of any such analysis shall give rise to the following
rebuttable presumptions:
If there was 0.05% or less by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, it shall be presumed that
such person was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
If there was in excess of 0.05%, but less than 0.15% by weight of alcohol in the person's
blood, such fact shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under
the influence of intoxicating liquor, but such fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining whether such person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

Municipality, shall be authorized only by the Police Department and only under the circumstances
herein provided. Towed vehicles shall be impounded at facilities designated by the Police Department
until lawfully claimed or disposed of pursuant to state law, 625 ILCS 5/1-100 et seq.
Towing Without Notice; Immediate Tows. Hazardous or unlawful vehicles may be towed without
prior notice; except that, when an unlawful vehicle is only one that has been reported as stolen
and is not towable for some other specific reason, the owner should be, when practicable, notified
by telephone or other means and given the opportunity to claim or move the vehicle, if he so
wishes, to avoid incurring the expenses of a police-ordered tow. Provided, however, that the
vehicle may be towed if the owner permitted the tow to be made when the vehicle was reported
stolen or at any time thereafter, in the form provided in § 9-9-10. Within 24 hours after towing a
vehicle pursuant to this chapter, a notice shall be sent to or personally delivered to the owner of
the vehicle affording the opportunity for a hearing as provided in §§ 9-9-5 and 9-9-6 of this
chapter.

certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the owner of the vehicle as
indicated in the most current registration list of the Secretary of State. The notice shall be in the
form provided in § 9-9-8 of this chapter. In the event that an out-of-state vehicle is proposed to be
towed, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made of the Secretary of State of the
particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the
owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished,
though in no case will the Municipality be required to delay towing more than seven days after the
date of the mailing or personal delivery of the notice if no request for a hearing has been received
within that seven-day period.
A notice of intent to tow sticker with the earliest date upon which the tow may take place and the
address and phone number of the Police Department shall be placed on the vehicle.
§ 9-9-4. Pre-tow hearing procedures.
[4-18-1988]
Opportunity for Hearing. The owner or person entitled to possession of a vehicle to be towed as
an abandoned vehicle shall have seven days after the date of mailing or personal delivery of the
notice to request, in writing, a pre-tow hearing. Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle
may be towed, if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the seven-day period,
and any hearing rights under the provisions of this chapter will be deemed waived.
Scheduling of Pre-Tow Hearing. The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled for a date within 14 days
of the mailing or personal delivery of the pre-tow notice. The Municipality shall not be required to
delay towing longer than such a fourteen-day period.

the Police Department. At the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing
date and time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.
Appointment of Hearing Officer. The Municipality shall choose an officer or employee of the
Municipality to serve as Hearing Officer. In no case shall that Hearing Officer be an individual who
was involved in the initial decision to tow the vehicle. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority
to require the presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow or any other
Municipal personnel.
Nature of Hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence shall not
apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle.
After receiving all relevant evidence, the Hearing Officer shall make a written decision based upon
a preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is authorized by the laws of
the State of Illinois or the ordinances of the Municipality, with a specific statutory or ordinance
section cited in the decision. The owner shall be provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision.
Decision to Tow and Rates to be Charged. If the preponderance of the evidence supports towing
and compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle
be towed, with any towing and storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof. The fees
to be charged for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by the
Chief of Police pursuant to the provisions of § 9-9-5 of this chapter. The owner of said vehicle
having had such a hearing may avoid the towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the
improper location to a proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle.
Decision Not to Tow. If the preponderance of the evidence fails to support towing of the vehicle,
the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle shall not be towed. The Municipality shall furnish a
copy of such decision to the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible
from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No vehicle about which such a decision
has been rendered shall be towed by the Municipality unless the circumstances under which the
decision was rendered have changed. If at some subsequent time the Municipality should wish to
tow the vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required for the towing
of any other similarly situated vehicle.
Reports and Documents to be Retained; Contesting Decisions. Originals or copies of all notices,
pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports and any associated police reports or documents, shall
be retained by the Police Department for a period of at least five years after each hearing, or after
each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The Municipality or the owner may contest the
decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.
§ 9-9-5. Post-tow notice for hazardous and unlawful vehicles.
[4-18-1988]
Mailing or Delivery of Notice. Notice pursuant to this section shall be forwarded by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the owner of vehicle as indicated in the
most current registration list of the Secretary of State, unless the notice is personally delivered to
the owner, in which case, the date and time of the delivery and the name of the police officer
making the delivery shall be noted in the Police Department records or reports. The notice shall be
in the forms provided in § 9-9-7A and B of this chapter, and shall be mailed or delivered within 24
hours of the tow, as provided in § 9-9-2A. In the event that the Municipality has towed an out-ofstate
hazardous or unlawful vehicle, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made of the
Secretary of State of the particular jurisdiction for the furnishing of the most current registered
name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to
the address furnished.
Posting of Signs Showing Hearing Rights. All approved towing service operators shall prominently
post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least 12 inches by 18 inches indicating the
12/23/2019 Village of Thornton, IL
https://ecode360.com/print/TH3959?guid=33655749,33656239,33656247,33656278,33656289,33656396,33656529,33656533,33656543,33655… 366/518

opportunity and procedures for a hearing to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign, the
form for which is set out in § 9-9-7A, shall be placed in locations readily visible to the public
transacting business at any towing facility. If a towing service operator performs services for more
than one Municipality, the information for contacting the various appropriate Municipal offices can
be listed in one such sign, the format for which shall be substantially similar to the form set out in
§ 9-9-7A.
Requests for Post-Tow Hearings. Requests for hearings may be made in person at the office
indicated on the notice within 15 days of the mailing or personal delivery of the notification of tow,
or release of the vehicle, whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be deemed
waived. Requests for hearings by persons who reside more than 50 miles from the Municipality
may be made in person or by mail received by the Municipality within the fifteen-day period.
Release of Motor Vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to possession of any impounded
vehicle shall be permitted to remove same, the owner or other person entitled to possession shall
furnish evidence of his identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his right to possession, sign a receipt
for the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owned for towing and storage fees to the towing
service operator. The Police Chief is authorized to promulgate regulations as to the documents or
other proof necessary to establish these facts.
Establishment of Maximum Towing and Storage Rates. The owner shall pay fees to the towing
service operator for towing and storage on police-ordered tows at rates that do not exceed
maximum amounts to be administratively established by the Chief of Police and which may be
revised from time to time. The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and sign
concerning vehicle release requirements set forth in § 9-9-7A. However, nothing in this chapter is
intended to prevent a competitive towing service operator from charging less than the established
maximum rates for police-ordered or any other tows. In arriving at the maximum rates for various
services, the Chief of Police shall consider such matters as the prevalent market rates in the area
for the different types of vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for categories such
as large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount of work required
to perform various types of towing operations. For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such
as large or serious accidents, the Chief of Police is authorized to allow towing operators to charge
rates above those established for normal situations, which special charges must be based upon
the cost of services provided, taking into account such matters as the man-hours and equipment
time required for the job. A towing service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such
a billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow, and supply a copy of the itemized
bill to the owner and to the Police Department. Any such special rates charged must be customary
in the towing industry in the area for the nature and extent of the services provided. Every towing
service operator and the Police Department shall have available a copy of the complete, current
rate schedule and any special rate policy established by the Chief of Police, for vehicle owners to
view upon request.
§ 9-9-6. Post-tow hearings procedures.
[4-18-1988]
Opportunity for Hearing. The owner of a vehicle towed as an immediate tow, by or pursuant to the
authority of the Police Department as set forth herein, shall be provided the opportunity for a posttow
hearing to determine the validity of such tow and any towing or storage charges. The hearing
will not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation issued relative to any towed vehicle.
Nature of the Hearing and Hearing Officer. The nature of the hearing and the appointment of the
Hearing Officer shall be the same as set forth above in § 9-9-4D and E.

In those instances where the vehicle has been released upon the deposit of the full payment
currently owed for towing and storage charges, and the owner has properly requested a
hearing, the hearing shall take place within 15 days after the release of such vehicle, unless
the owner requests a later date convenient to all parties.
In those instances where the vehicle remains impounded, the hearing shall take place, at the
option of the owner:
On the next day after an owner's demand for such hearing, excluding Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays; if such demand is made after 1,500 hours (3:00 p.m.) or if the
unavailability of a necessary witness or evidence creates a particular difficulty in
conducting the hearing on the next calendar day, then a hearing shall be held on the
second day following the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; or
If acceptable to the owner, within 15 days of said request on a date convenient to all
parties.
Conduct of Post-Tow Hearing. The Hearing Officer shall review all evidence presented by the
vehicle owner and the Police Department or other Municipal employees, and shall make a finding
based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented, as the lawful authority for the towing
and storage of the vehicle. The Municipality must establish such authority by a preponderance of
the evidence.
Post-Tow Decision. For each hearing, the Hearing Officer shall complete a post-tow hearing
decision and attach such decision to the Police Department's original vehicle towing report and
supply a copy of the decision to the owner by personal delivery if the owner is present, otherwise
by mail. The decision and findings shall be substantially as stated in the form for the post-tow
hearing decision, set forth in § 9-9-9 of this chapter.
Reports and Documents to be Retained; Contesting Decisions. All originals or copies of the
notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any associated police reports or
documents shall be retained by the Police Department for a period of at least five years after each
hearing, or after each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The Municipality or the owner may
contest the decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.
Towing Services Subject to Ordinance. Notwithstanding any other ordinance or statutory
provisions to the contrary, any towing service operator authorized to perform tows on behalf of the
Municipality must perform its services subject to the provisions of this chapter. However, the
towing company shall have the right to recover the reasonable value of its services for policeordered
tows, which are not paid by the vehicle owner, from the Municipality. Provided, however,
that if a tow or the charge for a tow is found by a court to be illegal and the towing service operator
is required to return the charge for the tow to the owner of the vehicle, the Municipality shall not be
liable to reimburse the operator for the towing charges.

Trespasses to property; vandalism. Statement of purpose. Acts of vandalism resulting in
damage to real or personal property within this Village have increased, posing a threat to the
value of property and the welfare of residents. It is in the best interests of the Village that such

are related to the nature of the act and the type of offender, and that parents or legal
guardians or minors found guilty of such acts be held responsible for any monetary penalty or
order of restitution or reparation imposed. The diligent pursuit of such interests will tend to

[Amended 12-3-2001; 10-20-2003]
Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and
impoundment pursuant to §§ 9-12-4, 10-1A-11, 10-1A-12 and 10-1A-13 of this Code, the police
officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the Village or its agents.
Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify any person identifying
himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle owner's right to request a
vehicle impoundment hearing to be conducted under this section.
This subsection shall not apply: (1) if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that time and
the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was
discovered or reasonably should have been discovered; or (2) if the vehicle is operating as a
common carrier and the violation occurs without the knowledge of the person in control of the
vehicle.
Whenever the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this section makes a request of the
police department in writing for a vehicle impoundment hearing after the seizure, a hearing officer
shall conduct the vehicle impoundment hearing within 24 hours after the seizure, excluding
Sundays and legal holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the
hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer
determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and
impoundment for a violation of the Municipal Code of the Village of Thornton, the hearing officer
shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner
of the vehicle posts with the Village a cash bond in the amount not to exceed $500.
Unless a hearing is held pursuant to Subsection C above, within 10 days after a vehicle is seized
and impounded pursuant to this section, the Village shall notify by certified mail, return receipt
requested, the owner of record of the date, time and location of a hearing that will be continued by
order of the hearing officer, no later than 30 days after the vehicle was seized. The hearing shall
be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the Mayor. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in the violation, the hearing
officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the Village for
an administrative penalty in the amount not to exceed $500. If the owner of record fails to appear
at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the Village requiring the
payment to the Village of an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed $500. If the
hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the immediate
return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond.
If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, such penalty shall constitute a
debt due and owing to the Village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the
bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a penalty is
imposed, the Village may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment
against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle
shall continue to be impounded until the penalty is paid to the Village and any applicable towing
and storage fees are paid, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person
who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle, or (2) the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to
satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable
fees are not paid within 30 days after an administrative penalty is imposed under Subsection D
against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be
deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not
paid within 30 days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the hearing
officer's determination may be sought, or within 30 days after an action seeking administrative
review has been resolved in favor of the Village, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be

and fees applicable under this section have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of

Department of the Village within seven days after its issuance, and the Police Department,
through a member designated by the Chief of Police, shall arrange for a time and place for hearing
of the alleged violation before the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.

building and land uses and for the proper location of all types of uses required for the social and
economic welfare of the Village. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is
classified as permitted in one or more of the various districts established by this Title. The uses set
forth in this Title, however, because of their unique characteristics, only can be located properly in
some district or districts upon consideration in each case of the impact of such a use at the
particular location. Such uses, hereby designated as special uses, fall into two categories:
Uses either municipally operated, or operated by regulated public utilities or uses traditionally
affected with a public interest; and
Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give
rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public
facilities.

§ 11-9-5. Planned developments.
[1983 Code; amended 12-4-2006]
Planned developments, as defined in § 11-1-3 of this Title, are of such substantially different character
from other special uses that specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby set out to
govern the recommendations of the Zoning Board of Appeals and the action of the Village Board of
Trustees.
Use Exceptions. In the case of residential, business or industrial planned developments, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the Village Board of Trustees may authorize that
there be in part of the area of such development and for the duration of such development,
specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the district in which said development is
located; provided the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that:
The uses permitted by such exception are necessary or desirable and are appropriate with
respect to the primary purpose of the development;
The uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or so located as to exercise a
detrimental influence on the surrounding neighborhood, nor will the development substantially
change the character or intent of the district in which it is located; and
In an industrial planned development, such additional uses allowed by exception shall
conform with the performance standards of the district in which the development is located.
Exception to Bulk Regulations. In the case of any planned development, the Zoning Board of
Appeals may recommend and the Village Board of Trustees may authorize exceptions to the
applicable bulk regulations of this Title within the boundaries of such development; provided that
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that:

Such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an integrated site plan no less
beneficial to the residents or occupants of such development as well as to neighboring
properties than would obtain under the bulk regulations of this Title for buildings developed on
separate zoning lots.
The overall bulk of buildings of the development shall not exceed that prescribed in this Title
for the district in which it is located.
The minimum lot area per dwelling unit requirements of this Title shall be adhered to in any
such development containing residential uses, and there shall be available to each residential
building and immediately adjacent thereto (including the land area upon which it is erected),
the minimum amount of land area required herein.
Spacing between principal buildings shall be at least equivalent to such spacing as would be
required between the buildings similarly developed under the terms of this Title on separate
zoning lots, due consideration being given to the openness normally afforded by intervening
streets and alleys.
Along the periphery of such planned developments, yard shall be provided as required by the
regulations of the district in which said development is located.
Requirements. At the time application for a special use permit is made, the applicant shall submit
to the Board of Trustees a detailed tentative development plan for the proposed use and
development of the tract of land as a planned development. Such tentative development plan shall
include the following:
A tentative site plan indicating the areas to be developed for buildings, the anticipated total
gross floor space, the areas to be developed for parking, the points of ingress and egress,
including access streets where required, and the adjustments to be made in relation to
abutting land uses and zoning districts.
A traffic survey prepared by a traffic consultant setting forth and analyzing the effects of the
proposed planned development upon traffic in and outside of the Village, and such survey
shall not be limited to the effect on adjacent streets, but shall extend to all of the surrounding
areas affected and shall indicate the anticipated points of origin, the direction, amount and
density of traffic flow to and from the proposed planned development.
An architect's preliminary sketches of the proposed planned development.
Plan Commission Review. Upon receipt of the application for special use permit and the tentative
development plan as aforesaid, the Board of Trustees shall refer a copy of the application and
tentative development plan to the Plan Commission for a study and report thereon. The Plan
Commission's report to the Board of Trustees shall be made within 30 days from the date of the
reference to the Plan Commission. In its report, the Plan Commission shall make such
recommendations as it considers desirable and in the public interest.
Board of Trustees' Approval. Upon receipt of the report of the Plan Commission, the Board of
Trustees may approve or disapprove the tentative development plan and shall proceed to issue or
deny a special use permit in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided, that any
special use permit issued hereunder shall be strictly conditioned upon the submission, within 180
days from the date of its issuance, of a final development plan conforming as nearly as practicable
to the tentative development plan as approved.

§ 11-10-5. Variations.
[1983 Code]
Authority.
In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to this Title, the Board shall, before
making any variation from this Title in a specific case, first determine that the proposed
variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or
unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or
endanger the public safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values
within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort,
morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the Village. The concurring vote of four members of the
Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decisions or determination of
the Administrative Officer or to decide in favor of the applicant in any matter upon which it is
authorized by this Title to render a decision. Copies of all findings, orders and decisions of the
Board shall be transmitted to the Board of Trustees for their final approval.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the Board the power or
authority to alter or change the Zoning Title or the District Map, such power and authority
being reserved to the Village Board. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give to
the Board the power or authority to give final approval on any appeal for a variance, such
power and authority being expressly reserved to the Village Board.
Authorized Variations. When a property owner shows that a strict application of the terms of this
Title relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures, or to the use of the
land, imposes upon him practical difficulties or practical hardship, then the Board may make such
variations of the strict application of the terms of this Title as are in harmony with its general
purpose and intent when the Board is satisfied, under the evidence heard before it, that a granting
of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to
alleviate some demonstrable hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant the variation in the
following instances:
To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot in single
ownership as shown of record.
To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been destroyed or
damaged to an extent of more than 60% of its value, by fire or act of God or the public enemy,
where the Board shall find some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the
nonconforming use, and in no case shall such a permit be issued if its primary function is to
continue a monopoly.
To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in any location for a public
service corporation for public utility purposes which the Board deems reasonably necessary
for the public convenience or welfare.
To make a variance where, by reason of an exceptional situation, surroundings or condition of
a specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of

a specific piece of property of record, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions,
the strict application of any provision of this Title would result in peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties or particular hardship upon the owner of the property and amount to a
practical confiscation of property as distinguished from a mere inconvenience to such owner,
provided such relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and
without substantially impairing the general purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan as
established by the regulations and provisions contained in this Title.
To interpret the provisions of this Title where the street layout actually on the ground varies
from the street layout as shown on the District Map fixing the several districts.
To permit lots that were of record at the time of passage hereof and which contain less than
the intensity of use requirements of the dwelling district in which they are located to be used
for single-family dwellings and to vary the side yard regulations for such lots, but only when
the owner or owners of such lots furnish substantial proof of the inability to acquire, or to
acquire at a reasonable price, additional land adjoining the lot which would be necessary to
provide the required lot area.
To extend the period within which a nonconforming commercial or industrial use is to be
removed from a dwelling district, when the owner or owners can furnish substantial proof that
the building was so extensively remodeled, reconstructed or structurally altered after the
original construction that it practically resulted in a new building, but such extension of the
period shall not exceed 40 years from the date of such remodeling, reconstruction or
structural alteration.
To waive the parking requirements in the commercial, business or industrial districts
whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full
provision of parking facilities or where such regulations would impose an unreasonable
hardship upon the use of the lot as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a
convenience.
To permit land within 200 feet of a multiple dwelling to be improved for the parking spaces
required in connection with a multiple dwelling, but only when there is positive assurance that
such land can be used for such purpose during the existence of the multiple dwelling.
The applicant, at the time of filing the application for variation or change, shall furnish to the
Village Clerk a list containing the names and addresses of each of the recorded owners, as shown
by the Recorder of Deeds or Registrar of Titles in Cook County, of all property within 250 feet of
any part of the lot line of the applicant's property for which the variation or change is requested.
The Village Clerk shall serve written notice by U.S. postal card on said owners of record. Such
notice shall be mailed at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing of applicant's petition
and shall contain the post office address or other description of the applicant's property, a brief
statement of the nature of the requested variation or change, the name and address of the
applicant, and the date, time and place of the hearing on said application.
Hearing. The Board shall make no variation except in a specific case and after a public hearing
conducted by the Board. A notice of the time and place of such public hearing shall be published
in a paper of general circulation in the Village not more than 30 nor less than 15 days before the
hearing. Such notice shall contain the address or location of the property for which the variation or
other ruling by the Board is sought, as well as a brief description of the nature of the appeal.

review. The Plan Commission shall schedule a meeting with the owner or subdivider within 30
days of the filing date of the preliminary plan and shall render a decision regarding the
acceptability of the plan within 60 days of said filing date. The Board of Trustees shall review
any matter in dispute on the preliminary plan and submit a formal recommendation for
settlement thereof to the Plan Commission. One copy of the preliminary plan as approved by
the Plan Commission shall be forwarded to the Village President. All surplus copies of the
preliminary plan, as originally submitted, shall be revised in accordance with the plan
approved by the Plan Commission and forwarded, together with formal notification of such
approval, to the owner or subdivider.

Collector streets 300
Minor streets 150
Different connecting street gradients shall be connected with vertical parabolic curves. Minimum
length in feet of these curves shall provide a stopping sight distance of not less than 300 feet.
Minor streets shall be so aligned that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
Street jogs with center line off-sets at intersections of less than 150 feet shall be avoided.
It must be evidenced that all street intersections and confluences encourage safe and efficient
traffic flow and, in general, be at or near right angles avoiding acute angles. An intersection of
more than two streets shall be avoided unless specific conditions of design indicate otherwise.
Alleys are not permitted in residential areas, unless deemed necessary by the Plan Commission.
A cul-de-sac street in a single-family residential district shall be not more than 500 feet in length,
measured along the center line from the street of origin to the end of its right of way; provided,
however, that no more than 15 lots shall abut the cul-de-sac street. In multiple-family residential
districts, such streets shall not exceed 300 feet in length. Each cul-de-sac shall have a terminus of
nearly circular shape with a minimum diameter of 100 feet.
Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the
subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the Board of
Trustees finds it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever an existing or dedicated half street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. A half street, where
included, shall be graded at one level and the regrading or new construction of any half street
shall conform to the grade and pavement of the adjacent half street.
Provision shall be made for vehicular and pedestrian access to residential property abutting
arterial streets either by providing marginal access streets, or by backing lots to the arterial street
and providing access by a collector, minor or cul-de-sac street one lot depth removed. A
dedicated, nonaccess fence strip shall be provided along the rear property line which abuts an
arterial street. These standards are established for the purpose of providing protection to
residential properties and to separate through and local traffic.
Drainage gradients of streets shall be at least 0.4%. Street grades shall not exceed 5% on
collector streets nor 7% on minor streets. Street grades shall be such as to provide natural surface
drainage of storm water regardless of the presence or absence of storm sewer facilities. The intent
of this requirement is to avoid depressions greater than one foot in depth along any given street
profile which will flood in flash storms for which storm sewers are inadequate.
Underground drainage systems shall be required when appropriate to the land as determined by
topography and distance from drainage channels.

such other lot lines as to provide continuity of alignment from block to block. At deflection points in
these easements, additional easements shall be established for pole-line anchors if overhead
utility lines are contemplated.
Where easements are necessary to provide storm water drainage, such easements shall be at
least 10 feet wide and established in the same manner as utility easements. Where a subdivision
is transversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, sufficient right of way adjacent
to and including such watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream shall be dedicated for public
use to allow for maintenance. Such dedication shall include a strip of land at least 10 feet in width
on both sides of the defined watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream. All data required
concerning such watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream shall be provided by the
subdivider.
§ 12-4-6. Block standards.
[1983 Code]
The maximum lengths of blocks shall be 1,200 lineal feet, and the minimum length of blocks shall
be 250 lineal feet. Pedestrian ways leading to schools, parks or other common destinations may
be required by the Plan Commission.
The shape of blocks shall be dictated by topographical features, the basic street system and traffic
patterns, lot depths and areas designated for public and other nonresidential land uses.
Blocks intended for commercial, industrial and institutional use must be designated as such, and
the plan must show adequate off-street areas to provide for parking, loading docks and such other
facilities as may be required to accommodate motor vehicles.
Where a subdivision borders upon or is transversed by a railroad right of way or arterial street, the
Plan Commission may require a street (on one or both sides of such right of way or street
approximately parallel to and at a distance removed suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, i.e., park purposes, deep residential lots with a planting or fence strip established
along the rear property lines, and off-street parking, business or other uses as permitted by the
zoning regulations.[1]

§ 13-1-2. Definitions.
[7-21-2008(2)]
For the purposes of this Title, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE
A nonhabitable structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be
insured and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.
ACT
An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the State of Illinois," 615
ILCS 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT
Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application.
APPROPRIATE USE
Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and will be considered for permit
issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are as specified in § 13-1-7B.
BASE FLOOD
The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is
also known as the one-hundred-year frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation
at any location is as defined in § 13-1-5 of this Title.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)
The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT
That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING
A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above
ground, including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings, and gas or liquid storage tanks.
The term also includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than
180 days per year.
CHANNEL
Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded area, flowage,
slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully, ravine, wash, or natural or man-made drainage way, which
12/23/2019 Village of Thornton, IL
https://ecode360.com/print/TH3959?guid=33655749,33656239,33656247,33656278,33656289,33656396,33656529,33656533,33656543,33655… 484/518
has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION
Alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimensions or materials of its bed or banks.
Channel modification includes damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening,
straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom or
banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation, debris, or
trash from the channel. Canalization is a severe form of channel modification involving a
significant change in the channel cross-section and typically involving relocation of the existing
channel (e.g. straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE
An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent volume of storage within the SFHA used to
balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within
the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase off-site
floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE
Preconstruction approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map.
This preconstruction approval, pursuant to this Title, gives assurances to the property owner that
once an Appropriate Use is constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be
changed, as previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as-built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR)

flood boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood
insurance rate map, once the as-built plans are submitted and approved.
CONTROL STRUCTURE
A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes through the structure, given a specific
upstream and downstream water surface elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY
Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of the population and, if flooded, would create
an added dimension to the disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of
vital services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can put special
populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required include:
emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement
homes and senior care facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching
stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,
petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection is recommended include: sewage treatment plants, water treatment plants, and
pumping stations.
DAM
All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their abutments and appurtenant
works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams
may also include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage
tanks are not included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY
The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or
watercourse, generally depicted on the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey
the existing one-hundred-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in
stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a 10% increase in
velocities.

Mitigation includes those measures necessary to minimize the negative effects which floodplain
development activities might have on the public health, safety and welfare. Examples of mitigation
include: excavation of compensatory storage, soil erosion and sedimentation control, and channel
restoration. Mitigation may also include those activities taken to reduce a structure's susceptibility
to flooding.
NATURAL
When used in reference to channels means those channels formed by the existing surface
topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A natural stream tends to follow a
meandering path; its floodplain is not constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been
cleared, mowed or cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the area
with no substantial alteration of the course or cross-section of the stream caused by filling or
excavating. A modified channel may regain some natural characteristics over time as the channel
meanders and vegetation is re-established. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more
natural conditions by man through regarding and revegetation.

§ 13-1-3. How to use this title.
[7-21-2008(2)]
The Building Commissioner shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in § 13-1-4.
To fulfill those duties, the Building Commissioner should first use the criteria listed in § 13-1-5,
Base Flood Elevations, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain.
Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the Building Commissioner
must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or
within a SFHA or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified.
12/23/2019 Village of Thornton, IL
https://ecode360.com/print/TH3959?guid=33655749,33656239,33656247,33656278,33656289,33656396,33656529,33656533,33656543,33655… 491/518

If the site is within a flood fringe, the Building Commissioner shall require that the minimum
requirements of § 13-1-6 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Building Commissioner
shall require that the minimum requirements of § 13-1-7 be met. If the site is located within a
SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the
Building Commissioner shall require that the minimum requirements of § 13-1-8 be met.
In addition, the general requirements of § 13-1-9 shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of § 13-1-6, 13-1-7, or 13-1-8. The Building Commissioner shall assure that all
subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of § 13-1-10. If a variance is to be granted for a
proposal, the Building Commissioner shall review the requirements of § 13-1-11 to make sure they
are met. In addition, the Building Commissioner shall complete all notification requirements. In
order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this Title, the Building
Commissioner may take any and all actions as outlined in § 13-1-13.
§ 13-1-4. Duties of the enforcement official.
[7-21-2008(2)]
Determining the floodplain designation. Check all new development sites to determine whether
they are in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they
are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted
and which drains more than one square mile. Check whether the development is potentially within
an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile), indicating that the
development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which
would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be
subject to the remaining sections of this Title.
Professional engineer review. If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile, the
permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer under the employ or contract of the
Village for review to ensure that the development meets § 13-1-7 or 13-1-8. In the case of an
Appropriate Use, the P.E. shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of
§ 13-1-7.
Dam safety requirements. Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential
in the event of failure. The construction or major modification of all Class I (high hazard) and Class
II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit. Some Class III (low hazard)
dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the
height of the dam and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off-channel detention basins
that have an embankment are non-jurisdictional Class III dam. It is not required that IDNR/OWR
"sign off" on all non-jurisdictional Class III dams. A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge
can estimate a hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is required.
A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the construction or major
modification of jurisdictional dams. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or
impoundment structures.
Other permit requirements. Ensure any and all required federal, state and local permits are
received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit.
Plan review and permit issuance. Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the Village meet the requirements of this Title; and issue a floodplain development
permit in accordance with the provisions of this Title and other regulations of this community when
the development meets the conditions of this Title.
Inspection review. Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure
proper elevation of the structure and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Title; and

schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the
inspection.
Damage determinations. Make damage determinations of all damaged buildings in the SFHA after
a flood to determine substantially damaged structures which must comply with § 13-1-9A3c.
Elevation and floodproofing certificates. Maintain permit files including:
An Elevation Certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a
residential or non-residential building subject to § 13-1-9 of this Title; and/or the elevation to
which a non-residential building has been floodproofed, using a Floodproofing Certificate, for
all buildings subject to § 13-1-9 of this Title.
Records for public inspection. Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood
data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance
documentation, Conditional Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map
Amendment and "as-built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all buildings
constructed subject to this Title.
State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by IDNR/OWR, for all
development projects subject to §§ 13-1-7 and 13-1-8 of this Title, unless enforcement
responsibility has been delegated to the Village. However, the following review approvals are not
delegated to the Village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
Organizations which are exempt from this Title, as per the Illinois Compiled Statutes;
IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in § 13-1-2 and all other
state, federal or local unit of government projects, including projects of the Village and
County, except for those projects meeting the requirements of § 13-1-7A2a;
An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood
damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, per § 13-1-7A2c(5);
An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to § 13-1-7A2c(4);
Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as indicated
in § 13-1-7A2c [13-1-7A2c(1), 13-1-7A2c(2), 13-1-7A2c(8)];
Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly navigable rivers, lakes and
streams;
Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles.
Cooperation with other agencies. Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management
agencies to improve base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood and floodway data and to
improve the administration of this Title; submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed
revisions of a regulatory map within six months whenever a modification of the floodplain may
change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain map; submit reports as
required for the National Flood Insurance Program; and notify FEMA of any proposed
amendments to this Title.
Promulgate regulations. Promulgated rules and regulations as necessary to administer and
enforce the provisions of this Title, subject however to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and
FEMA for any Title changes.

This Title's protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance Study for the Village. If a base
flood elevation or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site,
then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available from federal,
state or other sources. When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit a
detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to
IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any development of the site.
The base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of Thorn Creek
shall be as delineated on the one-hundred-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of
Cook County prepared by FEMA data August 19, 2008 and such amendments to such study
and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
The base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of
unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that
may be annexed into the Village shall be as delineated on the one-hundred-year flood profiles
in the Flood Insurance Study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008
and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to
time.
The base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as
an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the countywide
Flood insurance rate map of Cook County.
The base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining
SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the countywide Flood insurance rate map of Cook
County shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other
sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant
to determine base flood elevations.
When no base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood
or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined
from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP.
The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model,
such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various
publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood
discharges. For a non-riverine SFHA, the Base Flood Elevation shall be the historic Flood
of Record plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study. For an
unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile) which has
been identified by the Building Commissioner pursuant to § 13-1-4A, the base flood
elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in § 13-1-
5A4.
§ 13-1-6. Occupation and use of flood fringe areas.
[7-21-2008(2)]
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against
the base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory
storage, and other applicable provisions of this Title. No use will be permitted which adversely
affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of § 13-1-9.
Development permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development

Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Building
Commissioner. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to
scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed
by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations, using the
North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including
basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the
development will be subject to the requirements of § 13-1-9 of this Title.
Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Building Commissioner shall
compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the
base flood elevation of the current Flood insurance rate map and which has not been
filled after the date of the site's first Flood insurance rate map without a permit as
required by this Title is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of
this Title. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current Flood insurance rate
map is subject to the provisions of this Title. The Building Commissioner shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification
that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood insurance rate
map identification.
A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan
shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary
sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This
plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and
the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.
The Building Commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies
of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for
this type of activity. The Building Commissioner shall not issue a permit unless all other
federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.
Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to
public health and safety.
If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or one-hundred-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of
map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the
floodplain.
Compensatory Storage.
Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space
which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or onehundred-
year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a
hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or
one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation.
The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost
due to the fill or structure.
In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or
adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be
replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost

above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed
ten-year flood elevation.
All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.
Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE). A person who has
obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the
floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from
the Village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood
fringe. The Building Commissioner shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has
complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsection.
Compensatory storage shall be provided per § 13-1-6A2b.
The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access
ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE).
The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum
distance of 10 feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions
are such that this requirement cannot be met, the Building Commissioner may waive the
ten-foot minimum setback if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an
alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has
been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design
analysis, which shall be submitted to the Building Commissioner for review. The Building
Commissioner may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the
proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case
shall the setback distance be less than four feet.
The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of 20 feet from
the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this
requirement cannot be obtained, the Building Commissioner may waive the twenty-foot
minimum setback distance if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an
alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures
have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter
setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted
to the Village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet.
The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this
subsection and is at least five feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this
subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was
placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar
classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML
according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes.
The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one
material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction.
All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois
Licensed Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions.
The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five below the BFE.
There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of 1/4
horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove
seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times the estimated seepage rate and
shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of
the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.

The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow.
All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in
accordance with accepted engineering practices.
If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding
paragraphs of this subsection, the Building Commissioner may allow the construction of a
basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and
structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-
01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed
structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed
engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement
study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin
10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois Licensed Professional
Engineer.
In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth
of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed 18 inches, as measured from
the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater
depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely
and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to
drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses.
The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are Appropriate Uses, which
will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health
and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the
floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for
in this Title. Only those Appropriate Uses listed in 17 III. Adm. Code Part 3708 will be
allowed. The approved Appropriate Uses are as follows:
Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private
improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality
or habitat for fish and wildlife.
Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or
shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements
related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water
dependent uses;
Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;

direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall
maximum) that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage.
Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory structures that
will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any
modification thereto;
Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
The depth of flooding at the one-hundred-year frequency flood event will not
exceed 0.1 foot; or
The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees
to restrict access during over bank flooding events and accepts liability for all
damage caused by vehicular access during all over bank flooding events.
Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a positive non-erosive slop
toward a watercourse.
Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the
construction of water tight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of
floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the
outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than 10 feet away from the exterior wall
of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to
the structure.
The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damage building, provided that the
outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50% or
more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected
from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area
of the building below the one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation, and which will
not block flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks,
patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to 50% or more of the
market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the
building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
Appropriate Uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill,
building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to
accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including
landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as
specifically defined above as an Appropriate Use.
Within the designated floodway, the construction of an Appropriate Use, will be
considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following
engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans,
calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any structure
meets the protection requirements of § 13-1-9 of this Title:
Preservation of Flood Conveyance, so as Not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream.
For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or
dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be
replaced for all flood events up to and including the one-hundred-year frequency
flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors
shall be taken into consideration:

Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR ) where "n" is Manning's
roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is
the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te Chow, Open Channel
Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959)).
The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed
conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or
local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained
or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative land cover.
Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective
designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction
ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR
through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions
may be used with the same efficiency:
When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal
for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water
should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of
one foot vertical transition for every 10 feet of stream length shall be used.
Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid
expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to
flood flows.
Preservation of Floodway Storage so as Not to Increase Downstream Flooding.
Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage
lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and
the impact of any related flood control projects.
Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times
the volume of floodplain storage lost.
Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge
shall not be required to be replaced.
The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the
proposed normal water elevation and the proposed one-hundred-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through a determination
of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage
is hydraulically equivalent.

There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway
modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at
existing structure.
Preservation of Floodway Velocities so as Not to Increase Stream Erosion or Flood
Heights.
For all Appropriate Uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the
proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or
designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including
the one-hundred-year frequency event.
In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
Construction of New Bridges or Culvert Crossings and Roadway Approaches.
The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages
greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood
events up to and including the one-hundred-year frequency event; or the
upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood
easements.
If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1
feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or
waiver.
The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated
using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater
conditions for the flood study specified in § 13-1-5 of this Title. Bridges and
Culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved
hydraulic models.
Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per § 13-1-7A2c(2).
Velocity increases must be mitigated per § 13-1-7A2c(3).
If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational
or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the
existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by § 13-1-7A2.
All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per
§ 13-1-7A2c(8).
Reconstruction or Modification of Existing Bridges, Culverts, and Approach Roads.
The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall
be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the
existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the onehundred-
year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage.

If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood
damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's
engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the
existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on
upstream and downstream properties.
The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood
damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 17 Ill.
Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and
submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
On-Stream Structures Built for the Purpose of Backing Up Water.
Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to
the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the one-hundredyear
frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within
existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design
protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood
easements.
A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow.
All dams and impoundment structures as defined in § 13-1-2 shall meet the
permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Construction and
Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the
channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated
that:
The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing
flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as
for spawning;
The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or
habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation
basin.
A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the upstream
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is
more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in
which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream
municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
The project otherwise complies with the requirements of § 13-1-7.
Floodproofing of Existing Habitable, Residential and Commercial Structures.
If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing
building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed
no further than 10 feet from the outside of the building.

Excavation in the Floodway.
When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings,
including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert
structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other Appropriate Uses,
transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an
applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations
or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same
efficiency:
When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water
should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal
for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; and
When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water
should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and
When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of
one foot vertical transition for every 10 feet of stream length shall be used;
and
Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its
purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected.
Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, flood proofing of existing
structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high
flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt.
Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions
and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly
improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed,
or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural
resource values;
The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way
which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of
water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely
as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and
sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration
of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel
modification design, where practical.
Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream
and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent
erosion.
One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal
of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the

channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of
the vegetation.
Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential
for construction of the channel.
Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1
horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual
side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high
velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization
measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are
preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or
construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable
alternatives.
All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or
otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction.
Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize
disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover.
If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep
pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in
the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics
compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate.
A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the
modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of
construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of
water into the new channel.
There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or
leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a
public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of
a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no
reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a
result of the modification; and
The project otherwise complies with the requirements of § 13-1-7.
Seeding and Stabilization Plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and
stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Measures. For all activities in the floodway, including
grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil,
soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with
the following criteria:
The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation
possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed
and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed,
removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements.

Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas
as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15
days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to
denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for
longer than 60 days.
Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading
or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off
site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences,
straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and
basins.
A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished,
where possible, along existing channels [see § 13-1-7A2c(16)].
Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream
crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion.
Necessary construction in or along channels shall be destabilized immediately.
Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and
implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion
and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book"
and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
Public Flood Control Projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting
requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate
to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed
project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the
project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the onehundred-
year frequency event.
General Criteria for Analysis of Flood Elevations.
The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study,
referenced in § 13-1-5, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the
study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall
be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions
data to use.
If the one-hundred-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
The requirements of this section for the one-hundred-year frequency flood
elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations.
If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a
downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed,
modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed,
constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be
analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing
conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood
control project is built.

submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents
necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and
receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built
plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating
activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas
and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed
conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can
be given.
No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional
approval is issued.

or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer.
For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel,
the following criteria shall be met:
A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the
ordinary high water mark of the channel.
Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an
Appropriate Use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion
of construction.
After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and
issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as
necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or
structures or other construction that is not an Appropriate Use may be placed in that
area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision
is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and
concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built" plans.
Development Activities in Delegated Communities Requiring State Review. For those
projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the following criteria shall be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence and/or permit prior to the

3. Protecting buildings.
All buildings located within a one-hundred-year floodplain, also known as a SFHA, shall
be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. This building
protection criteria applies to the following situations:
Construction or placement of a new building or alteration or addition to an existing
building valued at more than $1,000 or 70 square feet.
Substantial improvements or structural alterations made to an existing building that
increase the floor area by more than 20% or equal or exceed the market value by
50%. Alteration shall be figured cumulatively during the life of the building. If
substantially improved, the existing structure and the addition must meet the flood
protection standards of this section.
Repairs made to a substantially damaged building. These repairs shall be figured
cumulatively during the life of the building. If substantially damaged the entire
structure must meet the flood protection standards of this section.
Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an
existing site (the building protection requirements do not apply to returning a
manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to
avoid flood damage).
Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days per
year; and
Repetitive loss to an existing building as defined in § 13-1-2. This building protection
requirement may be met by one of the following methods.
A residential or non-residential building, when allowed, may be construed on permanent
land fill in accordance with the following:
The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at or above the flood protection
elevation; and
Fill requirements.
The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than six inches deep before
compaction and should extend at least 10 feet beyond the foundation of the
building before sloping below the flood protection elevation; and
The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the
ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative
method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures; and
The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by
vegetative cover, riprap or other structural measure; and
The fill shall be composed of rock or soil and not incorporate debris or refuse
materials; and
The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface drainage from or onto
neighboring properties, and when necessary, stormwater management
techniques such as swales or basins shall be incorporated.
A residential or non-residential building may be elevated in accordance with the following:

The activity is not in a designated floodway; and
The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a pattern inconsistent with the
intent of the NFIP; and
The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the area involved
including existing stream uses; and
All other required state and federal permits or waivers have been obtained.
The Building Commissioner shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the
requirements of § 13-1-9 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 per $100
of insurance coverage; and
Increase the risks to life and property; and
Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and that the applicant will
acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and liability.
Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site or historic structure as defined
in § 13-1-2 "Historic Structures," may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of §§ 13-1-11B and 13-1-11C, subject to the conditions that:
The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure; and
The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being removed as a certified historic
structure.
§ 13-1-12. Disclaimer of liability.
[7-21-2008(2)]
The degree of flood protection required by this Title is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of
