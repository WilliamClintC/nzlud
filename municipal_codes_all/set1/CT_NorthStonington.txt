PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of North 
Stonington, Connecticut. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of 
selectmen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end 
thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time 
with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the 
reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant State law have been included. A table listing the State law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and 
Ellen K. Torof, Senior Code Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is 
gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance

HISTORY OF NORTH STONINGTON 
    North Stonington, which had been named in 1724 while still a part of the Town of Stonington, had 
been incorporated as a separate town in 1807, and had become the Town of North Stonington. 
    A great many people seem not to know the many reasons why the Town of North Stonington 
became incorporated. Some seem to think that the population increase had something to do with it. There 
are others who think that distance to travel to their house of worship had something to do with it. Then 
there are others who seem to believe that the difficulty of attending Town Meetings had a great deal to do 
with it due to the great distance to be traveled to attend these meetings. The foremost and primary reason 
was none other than taxation, taxes which were considered unjust due to the fact that these taxes were 
levied against North Stonington for improvements made for the Town of Stonington. 
    To understand the reason why taxation was the issue I would like to refer you to the "History of the 
Town of Stonington" as written by Thomas Wheeler, pertaining to its ecclesiastical history, to quote: 
    The first church organized in the Town of Stonington was formed June 2, 1674. 
    The 2nd Congregational Church of Stonington was organized in 1727. The controversy over the 
boundary line, dividing the Town of Stonington into two religious societies, and the location of their first 
meeting-house, served to divide the people as to the choice of a pastor for the church. 
    After calling Mr. William Worthington, Mr. Thomas Croghead and Mr. Jabez Wright, they finally 
agreed upon Mr. Ebenezer Russell as and for their gospel preaching minister, who was ordained 
February 22, 1727, at which time the church was organized. Reverend Russell continued pastor of the 
church until his death, which took place May 22, 1731. 
    The church and society then invited Mr. Joseph Fisk, who was ordained December 27, 1732, and for 
a few years Mr. Fisk's pastorate was eminently successful. 
    "The new light" awakening, as it was generally called by the people, served to divide the church, 
which resulted in the Organization of Strict Congregational or Separatist Church September 11, 1746. 
These two Congregational Churches maintained separate religious worship until March 16, 1827, when 
they were reunited under the ministrations of Reverend Joseph Ayer, 1827-1846. 
    The next church in the Town of Stonington was the Baptist Church, organized at Pung-Hung-we-
nuck Hill in 1743, and was the outcome of the Great Awakening (so-called) which commenced under the 
preaching of Drs. Edwards and Whitfield. 
    The next church of Stonington was the Baptist Church organized 1775 at Long Point (now 
Stonington Boro) where most members resided. 
    No more churches were organized in Stonington before the division of the Town in 1807, pending the 
agitation and controversial feeling between the inhabitants of the Northern, and Southern sections of the 
Town of Stonington, relative to the Old Mail Stage Route, and the layout of the new highway from 
Stonington Boro to old Mystic, and the construction of the bridge over Lambert's Cove, Pine Tree Point to 
Quana duct. 
    In order to give the electors of the Town an opportunity to decide the matter in question, a Town 
Meeting was legally warned and held at the old meeting-house at the Road, April 5, 1807, for the express 
purpose of dividing the Town of Stonington so as to relieve the tax payers of the Northern section of the 
Town from the cost of the new highway and bridge. 
    The meeting was largely attended and after an animated and heated discussion of the matter in 
question it was voted, by a small majority thereof, to divide said Town into two separate townships by the 
old society line, and that the North part shall be called Jefferson. 
    When the General Assembly met the May following, the division of the Town was duly considered 
and adopted and divided on the line suggested, but the name of Jefferson for the new Town was not 
adopted for the reason that the society of North Stonington had been so named by the General Assembly 
and had had charge of schools therein for a great many years, and the name had become identified with 
its vital interests, so it was considered not best to change it, and the new Town was called North 
Stonington.

Sec. 6-147. - Policy statement. 
    The Town Meeting of the Town of North Stonington, Connecticut, finds: 
(1) ?Adult-oriented establishments located in the Town of North Stonington require special 
supervision from the Town's public safety and zoning enforcement agencies in order to protect 
and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishment, as well as the 
health, safety and welfare of the Town's citizens. 
(2) ?Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United 
States indicate that: 
a. ?Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such adult-oriented establishments, 
especially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for the private 
viewing of so-called adult motion pictures and/or video tapes and/or live entertainment; and 
b. ?Persons under the age of 18 may be attracted to adult-oriented establishments and seek to 
enter or loiter about them without the knowledge or permission of their parents and 
guardians; and 
c. ?Closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms within adult-oriented establishments have been 
used by patrons, clients or customers of such adult-oriented establishments for the 
purpose of engaging in certain sexual acts; and 
d. ?Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to 
provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such 
booth, cubicles, studios and rooms; and 
e. ?Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of 
such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles, 
studios and rooms are in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and 
rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes, thereby promoting and 
encouraging prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and 
urine to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and 
rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons 
who may come into contact with such deposits; and 
f. ?The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented establishments tend to 
discourage such sexual acts and prostitution, and thereby promote the health, safety and 
welfare of the patrons, clients and customers of such establishments. 
(3) ?The continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments, including, without 
limitation, those specifically cited at Subsection (1) hereof, is and would be detrimental to the 
general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of North Stonington. 
(4) ?The Constitution and laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the Town powers, especially 
police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise adult-
oriented establishments as hereinafter defined in order to protect the public health, safety and 
welfare. 
(5) ?It is not the intent of the Town Meeting, in enacting this section, to deny any person rights to 
speech protected by the United States Constitution and/or State Constitution, nor is it the intent 
of the Town Meeting to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any 
communicative materials, including sexually oriented films, video tapes, books and/or other 
materials. 
(6) ?Further, by enacting this section, the Town Meeting does not intend to deny or restrict the 
rights of any adult to obtain and/or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United 
States Constitution and/or State Constitution, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any 
constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials 
may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such material.

State Law reference Water pollution control authorities, G.S. § 7-246. 


Sec. 9-22. - Regulations established by Authority. 
    These regulations for the use of sewerage systems within the Town of North Stonington are hereby 
established by the North Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority ("Authority") in accordance with the 
provisions of G.S. Ch. 103 (specifically, § 7-247). 
(Ord. of 9-25-2000, Art. I) 


Sec. 9-23. - Purpose. 
    These regulations are established to fulfill the objectives set forth in the North Stonington Water 
Pollution Control Plan adopted by the Authority on January 18, 1994 (the "plan"), as it may be amended. 
The findings, policies and objectives set forth in that plan are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by 
reference. It is specifically the purpose of these regulations to further the policy of sewer avoidance within 
the Town of North Stonington, but to provide municipal sewerage facilities to specific and limited areas 
within the Town in order to fulfill the Town's objectives for targeted industrial and other business-related 
nonresidential growth. Therefore, these regulations provide for the extension of municipal sewers only to 
those specific properties located within the North Stonington Sewer District, as established under Section 
9-25. 
    It is further the purpose of these regulations to prevent, minimize, and remediate the pollution of 
surface water and groundwater caused by the subsurface disposal of sewage. 
(Ord. of 9-25-2000, Art. II) 


Sec. 9-24. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of these regulations, the following terms shall be defined as follows: 
    Community sewerage system shall have the meaning set forth in G.S. § 7-245 of the Connecticut 
General Statutes (1997), as amended. 
    Delegated private sewerage system shall mean a private sewerage system for which the Town of 
North Stonington has delegated the power of review and approval to the North Stonington Water Pollution 
Control Authority. 
    Municipal sewerage system shall mean a sewerage system owned or operated by the Town of North 
Stonington, the Town of Stonington, or both. 
    Private sewerage system shall mean any sewage disposal system that is designed to provide for the 
disposal of 2,000 gallons or more of sewage per day, and that is not operated or proposed to be operated 
by a municipality, or by a municipal, state or federal agency. 
    Sewage shall mean any substance, liquid or solid, that may contaminate, pollute, or affect the 
cleanliness or purity of any water. 
    Sewerage system shall mean any device, equipment, appurtenance, facility and method for 
collecting, transporting, receiving, treating, disposing of or discharging sewage. 
(Ord. of 9-25-2000, Art. III) 


Sec. 9-25. - Use of the municipal sewerage system. 
(a) ?Establishment of sewer district. The Authority hereby establishes a sewer district to be known as the 
North Stonington Sewer District (the "sewer district"). The lands comprising the sewer district are 
specifically limited to the following areas: 
(1) ?The area comprising the OR zoning district, as depicted on the official zoning map of the Town 
of North Stonington as of the effective date of these regulations (9-25-2000, and as of October 
2014, said land is now part of the Economic Development District. 
(2) ?The area comprising that portion of the HC zoning district located at the northeast corner of the 
intersection of Connecticut Routes 2 and 184, as depicted on the official zoning map of the 
Town of North Stonington as of the effective date of these regulations (9-25-2000, and as of 
October 2014, said land is now part of the Economic Development District. No other portion of 
the HC zoning district is included in the sewer district. 
(3) ?The contiguous land area owned by the State of Connecticut as of the effective date of these 
regulations (9-25-2000) and located immediately south of Connecticut Route 617 and west of 
Connecticut Route 49 (as of October 2014, said land is now part of the Economic Development 
District). 
The establishment of the sewer district is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create any private or 
public rights to connect to the municipal sewerage system. The fact that a lot or parcel of land is located 
within the sewer district shall not, in and of itself, be a sufficient basis for the authority to allow a 
connection to the municipal sewerage system. Rather, the authority shall permit such connection only for 
the following lots or parcels within the sewer district, subject, however, to the provisions of subsection (c) 
of this section: 
(1) ?Properties that have been identified by the authority as having subsurface sewage disposal 
systems that, as of the effective date of these regulations, had already failed and that are 
incapable of being repaired or replaced on-site due to physical limitations and public health 
code requirements; 
(2) ?Properties that are zoned for industrial or other business-related, nonresidential development 
and that are served by a metered water-supply system; 
(3) ?Properties allowed to be connected to the municipal sewerage system in accordance with 
subsection (b) of this section. 
It is specifically the intention of the Authority and the purpose of these regulations to exclude from 
connection to the municipal sewerage system any properties not included in the categories set forth 
above or described in subsection (b) of this section, regardless of whether such excluded properties are 
within the sewer district or are proximate to the sewer line. Such exclusion is deemed by the Authority to 
be necessary to further the policy of sewer avoidance and to reserve the available capacity of the 
municipal sewerage system, as it may be provided under any intermunicipal agreement or agreements 
between the Town of Stonington and the Town of North Stonington, for properties to be developed for 
industrial or other business-related, nonresidential uses. 
(b) ?Connection of other properties to the municipal sewerage system. As set forth in subsection (a) of 
this section, it is the intention of the Authority that no properties other than those specifically 
identified in subsection (a) of this section be connected to the municipal sewerage system, 
regardless of whether such other properties may be near, abut, or contain any portion of the 
municipal sewerage system. Nonetheless, the Authority may allow the connection of other properties 
to the municipal sewerage system if, and only if, all of the following criteria have been met: 
(1) ?The connection of such property to the municipal sewerage system must be necessary to 
remedy the failure of a subsurface sewage disposal system; 
(2) ?The Authority must be provided with written certifications by a professional engineer properly 
licensed within the State of Connecticut and by the Ledge Light Health District, or a Town 
consultant having equivalent qualifications, that it is not feasible to repair or replace the failed 
septic system on-site and that all administrative remedies under the Connecticut Public Health 
Code, including the possibility of waivers or variances, have been exhausted; 
(3) ?The failed septic system must either have been: 
a. ?In existence on the date of adoption of these Regulations; or 
b. ?Constructed after the date of adoption of these Regulations in accordance with all then-
existing local, state, and federal land-use, health, and environmental laws (including, but 
not limited to, statutes, ordinances, regulations and codes), subject to the additional 
provisions set forth below. 
(4) ?The property to be connected must either: 
a. ?Abut a portion of the municipal sewerage system already in existence; or 
b. ?Abut another lot that is already served by, or that abuts any portion of the municipal 
sewerage system already in existence, 
Provided the Authority may refuse to allow the connection of any property to the municipal 
sewerage system if the remediation of the septic-system failure on such property would require 
the extension of the municipal sewer line by more than 200 feet (not including the length of any 
private sewer lateral line necessary to connect the failed septic system to the municipal 
sewerage system); and 
(5) ?The Authority must find that there is sufficient excess capacity available in the municipal 
sewerage system to accommodate the additional wastewater flows under any intermunicipal 
agreement or agreements the Town of North Stonington may have with the Town of Stonington. 
A septic system constructed after the date of adoption of regulations shall not be deemed to have been 
constructed in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3), above, unless the applicable laws would 
have allowed the construction of the septic system regardless of the existence or planned extension of 
the municipal sewerage system. 
(c) ?Power of authority to refuse connection. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of 
this section, the Authority reserves the power and right to refuse to allow any property, whether 
within or outside of the sewer district, to connect to the municipal sewerage system. Such refusal 
may be made if, in the judgment of the Authority, the proposed connection would result in 
wastewater flows of a volume or character that would, or could reasonably be expected to, have an 
adverse effect on any portion of the municipal sewerage system, including that portion located within 
the Town of Stonington. For purposes of this section, the term "adverse effect" includes, but is not 
limited to, overloading or chemical or physical damage to any portion of the municipal sewerage 
system. The Authority may also refuse to allow the connection of any property to the municipal 
sewerage system if, in the judgment of the Authority, the projected flow volumes would use up a 
substantial portion of the excess capacity available to the Town of North Stonington under any 
intermunicipal agreement or agreements with the Town of Stonington, and the Authority determines 
that the preservation of such excess capacity is necessary or desirable to accomplish other 
development objectives of the Town of North Stonington. 
In determining whether to refuse any request for connection to the municipal sewerage system, the 
Authority may also consider any potential impact of the use for which the connection has been proposed 
on groundwater quality and quantity, groundwater recharge, and existing and potential water supplies or 
water-supply sources. 
(d) ?Orders to connect. In accordance with G.S. § 7-257, the Authority may order the owner of any 
building to which the municipal sewerage system is available to connect the building to the system. 
No such order shall be issued until after a public hearing with respect thereto after due notice in 
writing to such property owner. Any owner aggrieved by such an order may appeal in accordance 
with the provisions of the General Statutes. If any owner fails to comply with an order to connect, the 
Authority shall cause the connection to be made and shall assess the expense thereof against such 
owner. It is the intention of the Authority that all properties within the sewer district having septic 
systems that have failed, and that cannot be replaced or repaired on site, be connected to the 
municipal sewerage system as soon as practicable after such connection becomes possible. 
(e) ?No increase in flows. The Authority recognizes that the capacity of the municipal sewerage system 
to receive sanitary sewage discharges from properties located within the Town of North Stonington 
may be limited by, among other things, intermunicipal agreements between the Town of North 
Stonington and the Town of Stonington. Therefore, it is the intention of the Authority that the average 
daily wastewater flows (measured on a monthly basis) from properties connected to the municipal 
sewerage system may not be significantly increased beyond permitted flows, as defined below, 
without the express written approval of the Authority. The permitted flow for any use shall be an 
average daily wastewater flow (measured on a monthly basis) that the Authority determines to be 
reasonably necessity for the conduct of an existing or proposed use. In making a determination as to 
the amount of any permitted flow, the Authority may consider any relevant information, including, but 
not limited to, available records of actual wastewater flows for existing uses. Any increase of more 
than five percent of 500 gallons per day, whichever is less, in a permitted flow shall be considered 
significant and shall not be allowed without the express written approval of the Authority. 
In order to facilitate the Authority's review of compliance with the provisions of these regulations, the 
owners or lessees of all nonresidential properties that are connected to the municipal sewerage system 
and that have projected or actual wastewater flows of 5,000 gallons per day or more shall be required to 
provide the Authority with written, daily records of the amounts of water usage on their respective 
properties. 
Compilations of such records shall be submitted to the Authority no less than once every three months. 
(f) ?Requirement of reporting land-use changes. In order that the Authority may properly monitor 
wastewater flows from properties connected to the municipal sewerage system, it is necessary that 
information regarding any significant changes to the uses of those properties be reported to the 
Authority. Therefore, any owner of property connected to the municipal sewerage system shall, prior 
to the construction of any additional buildings or structures on the property or any alteration of an 
existing building or structure that would increase its bulk volume, file with the Authority: 
(1) ?A written notice of intent to undertake such construction or alteration, together with sufficient 
plans to enable the Authority to understand and review the nature and potential effects of such 
construction or alteration on water usage; and 
(2) ?A written statement of the extent to which such construction or alteration, and the uses to which 
such new or altered buildings or structures may be put, may be reasonably expected to 
increase the average daily wastewater flows from the property. 
The Authority may refuse to allow the additional wastewater flow if it determines that the flow would 
either: 
(1) ?Exceed the capacity of the municipal sewerage system, as permitted under any intermunicipal 
agreement or agreements; or 
(2) ?Adversely affect any part or any process of the municipal sewerage system in the Town of 
North Stonington or the Town of Stonington. 
(g) ?Penalties for noncompliance. If the Authority finds that any connection has been made to the 
municipal sewerage system, or that any flows to the municipal sewerage system have been 
increased, in violation of any provision of these regulations, the Authority may order the 
disconnection of the noncomplying property from the municipal sewerage system, or may issue such 
other orders or take such other actions as may be allowed by law to bring such properties into 
compliance with these regulations. Except as provided hereafter, no such order shall be issued until 
after a public hearing with respect thereto after due notice in writing to such property owner. The 
Authority may issue such an order without first holding a hearing if it deems the immediate issuance 
of such order to be necessary to prevent imminent and substantial harm to any portion of the 
municipal sewerage system, whether located in the Town of North Stonington or the Town of 
Stonington; however, the Authority, shall, in such circumstances, provide an opportunity for a hearing 
as soon as practicable after issuing such order and shall provide due notice of the hearing in writing 
to the property owner. 
Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the Authority from taking immediate action to remediate 
or correct any condition or conditions that, in the judgment of the Authority, pose a threat of imminent and 
substantial harm to any portion of the municipal sewerage system, whether located in the Town of North 
Stonington or the Town of Stonington. 
(h) ?Assessments and sewer use charges. The Authority is hereby authorized to levy benefit 
assessments upon the lands and buildings located in the Town of North Stonington especially 
benefited by the acquisition, construction, or extension of the municipal sewerage system pursuant 
to these regulations, whether such lands or buildings abut on such system or not, and upon the 
owners of such land and buildings, according to such rules as the Authority may hereafter adopt, 
pursuant to the powers vested in the Authority under G.S. § 7-249, as amended, and subject to the 
right of appeal provided therein. In addition, the Authority may establish and revise fair and 
reasonable charges for connection with and for the use of the municipal sewerage system in 
accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 7-255, as amended, and subject to the right of appeal set 
forth herein. 
(i) ?Sewer connection approval and fees: Nonresidential and multifamily residential uses. 
(1) ?Approval required. Whenever it is proposed that property located in the Town of North 
Stonington be used for nonresidential or multifamily residential purposes, and that such property 
be connected to municipal sewerage facilities; or whenever any such use is proposed for 
property already connected to such facilities, such proposal must be reviewed by the Authority. 
No such connection shall be made without the approval of the Authority. 
(2) ?Application for approval. Any person who proposes to connect nonresidential or multifamily 
residential property located in the Town of North Stonington to municipal sewerage facilities, or 
to use an existing connection to such facilities for nonresidential or multifamily residential 
purposes, shall submit an application to the Authority on such forms as the Authority may 
require, together with sufficient information to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Authority, 
that the proposed sewerage system will comply with all applicable local, state and federal health 
and environmental laws ad regulations. 
(3) ?Fees for processing application. 
a. ?The application for such proposed connection or use of an existing connection shall pay a 
base fee of $500.00 to the Authority at the time of application. For purposes of these 
regulations, the "time of application" shall be the date upon which the applicant presents 
plans for the proposed connection or use to the Authority for review. The base fee is 
intended to offset, in part, the Town's costs for administrative and technical review and 
processing, including, but not limited to, publication of legal notices, preliminary review by 
Town administrative and technical staff, and hearing and transcription expenses. 
b. ?The applicant shall pay any further fees in an amount equivalent to the total amount of all 
fees and expenses charged by the Town of North Stonington's consultants and attorneys 
for engineering, environmental and legal review of the proposed connection or use of 
documents to be executed by the Town, the Authority, the applicant or others in connection 
with such review. Such additional fee must be paid in full before the connection is made or 
the use is established. 
c. ?The base fee and additional fees set forth in this section shall be in addition to, and not in 
lieu of, such other charges as may be established by law or regulation for the connection of 
property located in the Town of North Stonington to municipal sewerage facilities.

Sec. 9-26. - Community and delegated private sewerage systems. 
(a) ?Approval required. No community or delegated private sewerage system shall be constructed or 
operated without the review and approval of the Authority. 
(b) ?Application for approval. An applicant for approval of a proposed community or delegated private 
sewerage system shall submit an application to the Authority on such forms as the Authority may 
require, together with sufficient information to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Authority: 
(1) ?That the proposed community or delegated private sewerage system will comply with all 
applicable local, state, and federal health and environmental laws and regulations; 
(2) ?That the proposed community or delegated or delegated private sewerage system has been 
designed by a properly qualified civil engineer or other properly qualified professional; 
(3) ?That the proposed community or delegated private sewerage system will not cause 
unreasonable pollution to surface water or groundwater within the Town of North Stonington; 
(4) ?That the proposed community or delegated private sewerage system will be owned and 
managed in accordance with the criteria set forth in G.S. § 7-246f, as amended. 
(c) ?Fees for processing application. 
(1) ?The applicant for a proposed community or delegated private sewerage system shall pay a 
base fee of $500.00 to the Authority at the time of application. For purpose of these regulations, 
the "time of application" shall be the date upon which the applicant presents plans for the 
proposed community or delegated private sewerage system to the Authority for review. The 
base fee is intended to offset, in part, the Town's costs for administrative and technical review 
and processing, including, but not limited to, publication of any required legal notices, 
preliminary review by Town administrative and technical staff, and hearing and transcription 
expenses. 
(2) ?The applicant shall pay any further fees in an amount equivalent to the total amount of all fees 
and expenses charged by the Town's consultants and attorneys for engineering, environmental 
and legal review of the proposed connection and of documents to be executed by the Town, the 
Authority, the applicant or others in connection with such review. Such additional fee must be 
paid in full before the community or delegated private sewerage system is deconstructed.

Sec. 16-3. - Schedule of fees for processing land use applications.

thereby require applicants to pay the actual expenses accrued for the review, evaluation, and 
processing of applications to the Planning and Zoning Commission, where such expenses are 
directly attributable to each individual application.

complexity of the proposed land use development; and 
(3) ?To encourage applicants to become familiar with and to review the Town of North Stonington's 
development regulations, to submit applications that comply with the Town's regulations, and to 
submit complete plans and proposals with fewer errors and omissions. 
(b) ?Fee schedule (for consultant technical review): A schedule of fees for the processing of applications 
to the Planning and Zoning Commission is hereby established as follows: 
(1) ?This article is necessary as the Town has seen many land use applications which require a 
consultant's technical review. Such technical review is necessary for the protection of the public 
health, safety, and welfare. 
(2) ?The Planning and Zoning Commission may require an applicant to bear the consultant costs 
associated with additional technical review fees for applications for site plans, special permits, 
amendments to the zoning text, amendments to the zoning map, subdivisions, and re-
subdivisions, if it finds that the nature and intensity of the development may have significant 
impact on the site and surrounding areas, or that staff will not be able to complete a technical 
review of an application in the time period prescribed by State Statute or that staff does not 
have the technical expertise to review aspects of a particular project. 
(3) ?"Consultant" may include, but is not limited to: Town Engineer, Legal Counsel, Consulting 
Planner, Transportation Engineer, Radio-Frequency Engineer, Landscape Architect, Architect, 
Hydrologist, Geologist, etc. "Consultant" does not include the Town Planner, Zoning 
Enforcement Officer, Administrative Assistant, Sanitarian, Building Inspector, Fire Marshal, 
G.I.S. Coordinator, or Public Works Director. 
(4) ?When the Commission determines that a land use application necessitates the hiring of an 
outside consultant(s) to perform a technical review, the anticipated expenses of each such 
outside consultant shall be determined by staff and/or the Commission and promptly reported to 
the applicant. Staff and/or the Commission shall determine the fee for the outside consultant 
technical review of the application by multiplying the preliminary estimate prepared by the 
qualified consultant or expert by 150 percent. The applicant shall establish a fund with the Town 
of North Stonington in an amount not less than 150 percent of the estimated review expenses 
for the total project. 
(5) ?All such applicants shall be required to sign an agreement specifically agreeing to pay the 
aforesaid technical review fees as determined by staff and/or the Commission. Such agreement 
shall state the conditions imposed and the obligations of the applicant. 
(6) ?All applications to the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be accompanied by the 
administrative fee set forth herein. Additionally, technical review fees shall be paid, and the 
above mentioned agreement shall be signed by the applicant within 14 days of the date that 
staff reports the cost of the outside consultant technical review and inspection to the applicant. 
No application will be considered complete until such fee or fees have been paid, and such 
agreement has been submitted. 
(7) ?Prior to the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission, staff may revise the estimated 
expense of outside consultants and thereupon require the applicant to sign another agreement 
and deposit additional sums to cover such fees. These sums shall be paid by the applicant prior 
to the issuance of any permits. The Zoning Enforcement Officer is hereby prohibited from 
issuing any permits, approvals or sign-offs for an application for which such additional sums 
have not been paid. 
(8) ?Upon completion of technical review and final action on the application by the Town, the Town 
shall determine the costs incurred for the technical review and refund the excess funds to the 
applicant. Documentation of consulting costs incurred shall be provided to the applicant. 
(d) ?Fee schedule (administrative): All applications to the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be 
accompanied by the administrative fee as established by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
Note: The State of Connecticut General Assembly requires that a municipal agency or legislative body 
collecting designated land use permit fees add a state fee to the established fees.

inspection and monitoring compliance with the permit conditions and/or Town orders. No 
building permit, certificate of occupancy or acceptance of any part of the project will be issued if 
the site inspector's fees are not current. 
(2) ?Evaluation of plan to determine need for inspections. Each site plan, special permit, subdivision 
or re-subdivision plan submitted to the Town for final approval will be evaluated by the 
consulting engineer to determine the need for site/subdivision inspection and an estimate as to 
the number of hours required to accomplish the inspection service in a competent, professional 
manner. 
(3) ?Construction schedule. The developer or owner shall supply a detailed construction schedule 
to the land use office indicating the starting date and completion date of all phases of site and 
subdivision construction. Notice to the land use office shall be given by phone 24 hours in 
advance of any schedule changes. If not notified, the Town may charge the developer for the 
travel time of the inspector traveling to and from the site. 
(4) ?Determination of fee. The inspection fee to be charged shall be equal to the actual hourly rate 
of pay of the assigned inspector times the number of hours, including travel time, spent by the 
inspector inspecting each project or site. 
(5) ?Payment of fee. Based on the estimated number of hours required to adequately monitor and 
inspect the site, as provided by the inspector (see paragraph (2)), an estimated total fee will be 
calculated (see paragraph (4)), and the developer or owner will be required to deposit with the 
town finance department, prior to the start of any construction on the site, 150 percent of the 
estimated inspection fee as determined. 
(6) ?Refunding fees. Upon completion of the project construction, the Commission shall determine 
the costs incurred for the monitoring and inspection and refund the excess funds to the 
permittee. Detailed documentation of the inspection expenses will be provided to the applicant.

travel the road safely, the drainage conditions of the road, and generally the ability of any 
vehicle to use the road safely. 
(3) ?Scenic roads; stone walls. Frontage improvements, as described in the proceeding subsection, 
may be modified by the Board of Selectmen in order to achieve the objectives of the Section 18-
5. In addition, the Board of Selectmen may modify any requirements for improvements 
described in this section in order to preserve existing stone walls or other historic items which 
are a part of the Town's historic character. Any modifications pursuant to this paragraph shall be

utility companies, and the 911 numbering database agency. 
(8) ?No duplication of new street names shall be allowed. As safety factors dictate, the name of any 
existing street may be changed to prevent duplication of names. Similar sounding names are 
considered to be duplication regardless of spelling. Street names will be assigned by the North 
Stonington Planning Office and recommended to the board of selectmen for approval. Upon 
obtaining approval, the North Stonington Planning Office will notify the North Stonington 
Assessor's Office, who will notify the appropriate law enforcement department, fire department,

number before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Property which is assigned a number that 
is different than the one in current use shall display the newly assigned number within 30 days of 
receiving notice of the new number. In the case of rental property, the property owner is responsible 
for posting the numbers as well as informing the tenants of their new address. 
(1) ?Property numbers shall be affixed to dwelling units or some object appurtenant thereto so as to 
be visible from and oriented toward the street from which the address is taken. When the 
structure is within 50 feet of the edge of the street, the assigned number shall be displayed on 
the front of the building in the vicinity of the front door or entry and visible from the street. If the 
structure is over 50 feet from the street or if the line of sight is obstructed by plantings or other 
objects, then the number is to be displayed on a post, fence, wall or mailbox at the property line 
adjacent to the driveway entrance.

Chapter 1  Purpose and Authority
1-1
101 TITLE
These Regulations shall be known as the Zoning Regulations, Town of North Stonington,
Connecticut, and are referred to herein as these Regulations.
102 AUTHORITY
These Regulations have been promulgated by the North Stonington Planning and Zoning
Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, in accordance with and under the authority
prescribed by Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended. The Towns initial
Zoning Regulations were adopted by the Commission on May 21, 1964.
103 PURPOSE
These Regulations are adopted to further the goals and objectives of the Plan of Conservation and
Development and to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood and
other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to
prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the
adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public
requirements; to preserve the character of the various parts of the Town; to conserve the value of
buildings; to protect historic factors; to control soil erosion and sedimentation; to encourage energy
efficient patterns of development, the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy
conservation; and to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the Town of North
Stonington. In addition, these Regulations are adopted to give consideration to the character of each
area and its peculiar suitability for particular uses; conserve the value of buildings and encourage
the most appropriate use of land throughout North Stonington; protect historic factors and
resources; protect existing and potential public surface and ground drinking water supplies; provide
for the development of housing opportunities, including opportunities for multifamily dwellings,
consistent with soil types, terrain and infrastructure capacity, for all residents of North Stonington
and the planning region; and provide for housing choice and economic diversity in housing,
including housing that will meet identified housing needs. Further, these regulations, and
subsequent amendments thereto, are enacted to carry out the purposes set forth in Chapter 124, and
particularly §8-2, of the Connecticut General Statutes.
104 ZONING DISTRICTS AND OVERLAY AREAS
The Town of North Stonington is divided into the following principal Zoning Districts:
(R40) High Density Residential District
(R60) Medium Density Residential District
(R80) Rural Residential Preservation District
(C) Commercial District
(VC) Village Commercial
(HC) Highway Commercial District
(ED) Economic Development District
(RC) Resort Commercial District
(I) Industrial District
In addition to the foregoing principal zoning districts, the following Overlay Areas have been
established:
(VPO) Village Preservation Overlay Area
(WSPO) Water Supply Protection Overlay Area
(SUO) Seasonal Use Overlay Area
Chapter 1  Purpose and Authority
1-2
(AHO) Affordable Housing Overlay Area: Meadow Court
105 ZONING MAP
The boundaries of the various Zoning Districts and Overlay Areas are as shown on the North
Stonington, Connecticut, Zoning Map which accompanies, and which, with all explanatory
matters thereon, is a part of these Regulations. A copy of the Zoning Map, indicating the latest
amendments, shall be kept up-to-date in the Land Use Office and the Office of the Town Clerk for
the use and benefit of the public.
106 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
In determining the boundaries of Zoning Districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules
shall apply.
106.1 Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways, waterways or railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended, such center
lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.
106.2 Where district boundaries are not indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways, waterways or railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended, the
boundaries shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:
A. where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the property
lines of parks or other publicly owned lands, such lines shall be construed to be
such boundaries;
B. in all cases where a district boundary line is located not farther than 15 feet away
from a lot line of record, such boundary line shall be construed to coincide with
such lot line; and
C. in all other cases where dimensions are not shown on the map, the location of
boundaries shown on the map shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing
thereon.
D. When a district boundary cannot be determined using the methods described
above, the Commission may use any reasonably available information to establish
the location of the boundary.
106.3 Lot Divided by District Boundary. If a lot is divided by a district boundary, the bulk
regulations for the district having the largest minimum lot area requirement shall be
applicable to the entire lot. For example, if a lot is divided by the boundary between the
R40 and R60 Zoning Districts, the bulk regulations for the R60 Zoning District shall apply
to the whole lot. The buffers required for any lot divided by a district boundary shall be
determined in each part by the buffer requirements for the district in which that part is
located. The uses allowed on any lot divided by a district boundary shall be determined in
each part by the use regulations for the district in which that part is located. This provision,
however, shall not be deemed, on its own, to allow multiple principal uses on a single lot.
For example, if a single-family home is already located on a lot divided by the boundary
between a residential and commercial district, no commercial use may be made of that
portion of the lot lying in the commercial district.
Chapter 1  Purpose and Authority
1-3
107 PERMITS AND APPLICABILITY
A. No building and/or portion of a building shall be erected, moved or structurally altered; nor
shall any use be established or changed; nor shall any excavation be made for a proposed
building or structure, until a Zoning Permit has been issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer
or the Commission indicating conformance:
1. with these Regulations; or
2. to a Site Plan or Special Permit approval granted by the Planning and Zoning
Commission; or
3. to a variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
B. No building and/or portion of a building shall be erected, moved or structurally altered until a
Building Permit has been issued by the Building Official and in most instances, approval has
given by Ledge Light Health District.
C. No Accessory use/structure shall be established/erected without first establishing/erecting a
principal use/structure except as provided for elsewhere in these regulations.
108 CONSISTENCY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW
These Regulations are intended to comply with all applicable provisions of state and federal law.
In particular, many of the procedural requirements set forth in these Regulations are based solely
on state requirements that were in effect at the time of adoption. In the event that state or federal
law is later modified or is determined by a court to be inconsistent with any provisions of these
Regulations, it is the intention of the Commission that the relevant provisions shall be deemed
superseded by the applicable requirements of state or federal law and that those requirements shall
be applied as though they were expressly incorporated herein.
Chapter 2  Interpretation
2-1
201 GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THESE REGULATIONS
201.1 Prohibited if not permitted
Any use of land, buildings or structures not expressly permitted by these Regulations as a
principal use in a particular Zoning District, or allowable as an accessory use to such a
principal use, is prohibited in that District.
201.2 Application of Other Laws
Except as expressly provided herein, these Regulations operate independently from laws
and regulations established by agencies other than the Commission. The fact that a use,
including a building or other structure, may comply with these Regulations does not mean
that it complies with all other applicable laws, regulations or other legal restrictions or
requirements. Therefore, the issuance of any permit or approval by the Commission or its
authorized agent(s) does not necessarily mean that a landowner has obtained all necessary
permits or approvals for the use, or that the use may be lawfully established without such
other permits or approvals. By way of example only, the Commission might issue a permit
for a use that is, nonetheless, not allowable due to private land restrictions or because state
or federal law may restrict such use. The Commission has no legal authority to determine
whether legal restrictions other than those established by these Regulations, or by the North
Stonington Subdivision Regulations, apply to any particular parcel of land. Likewise, the
Commission has no responsibility to alert an applicant or landowner about the possible
application of any other laws, regulations, or similar restrictions that may affect any parcel
of land.
201.3 Conflicting Standards
When two or more differing standards are provided in these Regulations for any use, the
most restrictive provision shall apply.
210.4 References to Statutes and Regulations
Whenever any reference is made in these Regulations to a federal or state statute or
regulation, the reference shall be interpreted to mean the statute or regulation as it may
have been most recently amended, revised or renumbered (i.e., the most current form of
the statute or regulation), unless the context of the reference to the statute or regulation
requires a different interpretation.
202 SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED USES
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are expressly
prohibited in the Town of North Stonington:
A. landfills, resource recovery facilities, and non-municipal transfer stations, recycling facilities,
junk yards, private dumps, and the dumping or incineration of toxic substances, effluent,
garbage or rubbish;
B. uses that involve any activity, or the use of any material, defined as obscene or obscene as
to minors pursuant to §53a-193 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended;
C. the mining of trap-rock and/or other quarry-type stone;
D. circuses and amusement parks as principal uses;
Chapter 2  Interpretation
2-2
E. the distillation of bones, and tanneries;
F. coal or petroleum distillation or derivation of byproducts; blast furnaces or smelting of ores or
metal, manufacture of explosives; manufacture of cement, asphalt, bituminous, lime, gypsum,
or plaster of paris, or chlorine, or carbolic, hydrochloric, nitric, picric or sulphuric acid; fat
rendering in the manufacture of tallow, grease or oil; refining and recovery of products from
fish or animal refuse; composting in excess of one hundred cubic yards per year (unless
associated with a permitted waste to energy facility or other approved biotech facility); fuel
manufacture and storage by other than a public utility company except for on-site use; and
G. the use, for permanent storage outside of a building, of trailers and all other cargo containers
customarily used for road or sea transportation. (See §306 for regulations governing temporary
storage containers).
H. No accessory structure is permitted on a lot until and unless a Principal Use of Land or Principal
Structure has already been established on the lot, except as specifically permitted in §704.1
concerning Storage Sheds in the Seasonal Use Overlay Area.
203 ENFORCEMENT
203.1 Authority
A. These Regulations may be enforced by the Planning & Zoning Commission or by any
person authorized by vote of the Commission to act as a Zoning Enforcement Officer
(ZEO).
B. Except as these Regulations may otherwise provide, a ZEO shall have all of the
enforcement powers set forth in CGS §8-12, including the authority to inspect and
examine any building, structure, place, or premises and to order the remedying of any
condition found to exist there in violation of any provision of these Regulations.
203.2 Violations
If a ZEO shall find that any provision of these Regulations is being violated, he or she shall
promptly notify the Commission of such violation(s). The Commission reserves the right
to specify the manner in which it wishes the ZEO to enforce these Regulations and may
adopt specific policies for enforcement. However, the ZEO shall have the discretion to
initiate an enforcement response without awaiting instruction or comment from the
Commission. Such responses may include, without limitation:
A. An order to discontinue any illegal use of land, buildings, structures, additions,
alterations, or structural changes thereto;
B. An order to discontinue any illegal work being done; and
C. An order to take specific actions to remedy any violations.
203.3 Penalties and Other Remedies
The Commission or a ZEO may seek any penalties or other remedies allowable under state
or federal law for violations of these Regulations.
Chapter 2  Interpretation
2-3
204 INTERPRETATION OF TERMS

legal entity.
G. The phrase these Regulations shall refer to the entire Zoning Regulations.
H. The words building, structure, lot, land, or premises shall be construed
as though followed by the words or any portion thereof.
204.2 Words and Terms Defined
Words defined in Chapter 16 of these Regulations shall be interpreted as set forth in that
Chapter.
204.3 Words and Terms Not Defined

Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-1
301 APPLICABILITY
This section shall apply to all properties in all zones. Unless another provision of these Regulations
expressly provides otherwise, no building or structure shall be erected, reconstructed, structurally
altered, or enlarged without a Zoning Permit, nor shall any building, structure or land be used or be
designed for any use other than is permitted in the zone in which such building, structure or land is
located. Applications for a Zoning Permit shall be accompanied by a plot plan or site plan
containing adequate information to allow the Zoning Enforcement Officer (ZEO) to determine
compliance with all relevant provisions of these Regulations. The ZEO may require that such plans
be certified or otherwise verified by a licensed surveyor, engineer, or other qualified professional
when necessary to determine such compliance.
302 AIRCRAFT LANDING AREAS
Aircraft landing areas are not authorized as a principal use of property under these Regulations.
However, a Special Permit may be issued for an aircraft landing area as an accessory use in an R80
Zoning District or any Commercial or Industrial Zoning District provided that all the applicable
provisions of Chapter 13 are satisfied, and further provided:
A. Such facilities must be located on lots containing at least 10 acres of land and shall be for the
use of only the owner or lessee of the property or the guests or invitees of such owner.

establishments. Beer and wine may be sold in grocery stores. Except as permitted elsewhere in
these Regulations, alcoholic beverages of all types may be sold in restaurants and other hospitality
uses only for consumption on the premises, and only if the restaurant or other hospitality use is the
primary use and the sale or consumption of alcohol an accessory use.
304 CEMETERY PRESERVATION
If, during its review of any Site Plan or Special Permit application, the Commission finds that the
lot or parcel that is the subject of the application contains a burial ground, graveyard, or cemetery,
the Commission may condition any approval of the application on modifying or limiting the
proposed activities in a manner that will prevent disturbance of, limit inappropriate access to, or
facilitate maintenance of the burial ground, graveyard or cemetery.

305 NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS
305.1 Non-conforming Uses
A. A non-conforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded except as may be expressly
allowed elsewhere in these Regulations. No non-conforming use of an existing
building shall be extended to occupy land outside such building or space in another
building.
B. A non-conforming use of land shall not be moved to another part of a lot or to an
adjoining lot. No non-conforming use of a building shall be moved or extended to any
part of the building not manifestly arranged and designed for such use at the time the
use became non-conforming. A building containing a non-conforming use shall not be
moved unless the use is changed to a conforming use and all zoning requirements are
met.
C. Except as may be expressly allowed elsewhere in these Regulations, a non-conforming
use of land or of a building shall not be changed to any other non-conforming use. A
non-conforming use once changed to a conforming use shall not thereafter be changed
to a non-conforming use.
D. Normal upkeep, maintenance, and repair in a building occupied by a non-conforming
use is permitted provided that such work does not increase or expand the nonconforming
use or the building that houses the non-conforming use.
E. See §305.3.D of these Regulations regarding the division of lots that have more than
one residence, which is a nonconforming use of a single lot under these Regulations.
305.2 Non-Conforming Buildings and Structures
A. Any nonconforming structure lawfully existing at the time of adoption of these
Regulations, or any amendments hereto, may be continued as a nonconforming
structure.
B. Any non-conforming building or structure that contains a conforming use and that is
damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, neglect, casualty, or act of nature, may be
reconstructed, repaired, or rebuilt in the same location, but only to its previous floor
area and cubical content, and only if (1) such work does not increase the nonconforming
aspect of the structure or complies with other applicable parts of these
Regulations for the specific use and zone; and (2) any such reconstruction or rebuilding
process is commenced within one year of the date of damage.
C. A structure that is non-conforming because it does not comply with current yard or
setback requirements may not be expanded in such a way as to increase the total
volume of the building that does not comply with such requirements; e.g., the structure
may not be expanded vertically or horizontally within a required yard or setback area.
D. Normal maintenance and repair to a non-conforming building or structure are
permitted provided such work does not further violate the requirements of these
Regulations.
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-3
305.3 Non-Conforming Lots
A. Except as regulated in the SUOA (§704), nothing in these Regulations shall prevent
the construction of a permitted building or structure, or the establishment of a permitted
use in the relevant zoning district, on a lawfully existing parcel that does not contain
the required minimum area, minimum buildable area, or minimum lot frontage on a
street, provided that: (1) as of the date of initial adoption of these Regulations, and
continuously thereafter, the parcel was owned separately from an adjoining lot, as
evidenced by deed(s) recorded in the land records; and (2) a previously existing lot that
does not have frontage on an accepted street must have access to an accepted street
over a permanent right-of-way or easement.
B. Where two or more nonconforming lots are contiguous, and in one ownership, and
where at least one of the parcels is undeveloped, such parcels shall be combined or
merged to create a conforming lot or a more conforming lot to the extent possible.
C. A non-conforming lot shall not be altered in such a way as to increase the degree of
non-conformity.
D. Any lot that contained more than one residence building at the time of adoption of
these Regulations may be divided and sold as separate lots, provided that (1) each such
lot or lots conforms to the bulk and area requirements of the district in which it or they
are situated, and (2) each resulting lot contains at least one of the previously existing
residence buildings.
305.4 Exceptions
A. Additions may be made to single-family detached or duplex residential dwellings that
have become non-conforming solely as a result of a zone or text amendment change
that eliminated residential uses in the zone in which the relevant lot is now located.
However, all such additions (1) shall be solely for the use of the house as a residence
or for a lawfully permitted Home Occupation (see §504.2), and (2) must comply with
current yard, setback, height and other geometrical requirements of the relevant zone.
For purposes of this §305.4, single-story, accessory attached and/or detached garages
shall be considered residential additions.
B. Where two houses exist on one residential lot, each unit will be considered nonconforming
and each may be expanded in conformance with §305.4.A above.
305.5 Abandonment of Non-Conforming Uses and Characteristics
A. When a non-conforming use of property, or of a building or other structure, has been
abandoned, that use may not subsequently be reestablished except as may be expressly
authorized by these Regulations. The abandonment of a use may be inferred from the
circumstances of its discontinuance or from later circumstances, such as, but not
limited to, the removal of characteristic equipment and/or furnishings involved in the
use, without its replacement by similar equipment or furnishings for an extended period
of time, or the replacement of a non-conforming use or structure by a conforming use
or structure.
B. When a non-conforming characteristic of a building or other structure has been
abandoned, all subsequent modifications of the structure or property shall be required
to conform to these Regulations.
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-4
C. When a non-conforming use has ceased for a continuous period of one year, the use
shall be deemed to be abandoned unless, before the end of the one-year period, the
person or persons who were making or carrying out such use record a written notice in
the land records of the Town of North Stonington stating their intention to maintain
and preserve that use and describing, with specificity, the nature of the non-conforming
use they intend to preserve. If the use is not recommended for a continuous period of
one year after any such notice is recorded, the use shall be deemed to be abandoned
unless, before the end of such one-year period, a new notice is recorded on the land
records. The failure to file any such notice as required herein shall be deemed to be
incontrovertible proof of an intention to abandon a non-conforming use.
306 PORTABLE STORAGE CONTAINERS
306.1 Definitions. A portable storage container is any box-like container transported by truck or
trailer to a desired location. Units are designed for the outdoor storage of personal property
of household goods for temporary use only.

approved accessory building.
A. Portable storage containers may be placed outside a building on a lot in any district
during the construction and/or repair of a dwelling on the lot for a period not to exceed
12 months, and only if all necessary permits and approvals for such construction or
repair have been issued. Portable storage containers may be used during construction,
site modification, and/or property renovation in all non-residential districts only after
any required Site Plan or Special Permit, as well as all other permits and approvals
necessary for the proposed use to be lawfully commenced on the property, have been
issued. Storage containers shall not be vertically stacked, and shall not be placed
between the principal structure and any street adjoining the relevant lot. All portable
storage containers shall be placed, to the extent feasible, in locations that minimize
their visibility from nearby residences.
B. Extension of time. The Commission may approve the placement of a portable storage
container in any district for more than three months, provided the property owner has
demonstrated that extenuating circumstances exist to justify the extension. Extenuating
circumstances shall include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, fire or acts of God.
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-5
C. Agricultural Exemption. Portable storage containers may be used outside of a

307 SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA REQUIREMENTS
307.1 AREAS TO WHICH THIS REGULATION APPLIES
This regulation shall apply to all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) within the Town of
North Stonington.
A. Basis for Establishing the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA):
The Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for New London,
dated July 18, 2011, accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated July 18,
2011, and other supporting data applicable to the Town of North Stonington, and any
subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must
take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map
revision is obtained from FEMA. The SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as
Zones A and AE, including areas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. SFHAs are
determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or down) and should be verified
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-6
with the BFEs published in the FIS for a specific location. Also included are areas of
potential, demonstrable or historical flooding, including any area contiguous with but
outside the SFHA identified by FEMA, and where the land surface elevation is lower
than the base flood elevation (BFE) as shown in the FIS, and the area is not protected
from flooding by a natural or man-made feature. The FIRM and FIS are on file in the
Planning and Zoning Department, Town Hall, Town of North Stonington.
B. Structures Already in Compliance: A structure or development already in
compliance with this regulation shall not be made non-compliant by any alteration,
modification, repair, reconstruction or improvement and must also comply with other
applicable local, state, and federal regulations. No structure or land shall hereafter be
located, extended, converted, modified or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this regulation and other applicable regulations.
C. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: This regulation is not intended to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However,
where this regulation and another ordinance, regulation easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.
D. Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this regulation, all provisions
shall be: 1) considered as minimum requirements; 2) liberally construed in favor of the
governing body, and; 3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under State statutes.
E. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by
this regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This regulation does not imply or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood
Hazard Area or uses permitted in such areas will be free from flooding and flood
damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of North
Stonington or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this regulation or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder. The Town of North Stonington, its officers and employees shall assume
no liability for another persons reliance on any maps, data or information provided by
the Town of North Stonington.
307.2 ADMINISTRATION
A. Designation of the local administrator: The Planning and Zoning Commission or its
designee is hereby appointed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this regulation.
B. Certification:Where required under this regulation, a registered professional engineer
or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance
with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this regulation. Such
certification must be provided to the Planning and Zoning Commission or its designee.
C. Development Permit: The flood management section of the Development Permit
must be completed in conformance with the provisions of this regulation prior to the
commencement of any development activities. Permits issued under this regulation
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-7
shall expire if actual construction of a permitted structure does not commence within
one hundred and eighty (180) days of the permit approval date.
D. Permit Application Procedures: A development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in Special Flood Hazard Areas
in this community. Prior to any development activities, application for a development
permit shall be made to the Planning and Zoning Commission on forms provided and
may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing, at a
minimum, the property lines and location of the parcel; the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; limit and extent of the 100-year
floodplain and/or floodway boundary and base flood elevation(s); existing and
proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the
foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required to be submitted to the
Planning and Zoning Commission:
1. Application Stage:
The applicant shall provide at least the following information, where applicable.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
a. Base flood elevation (BFE) for the site in question as determined in the FEMA
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The FIS
flood profiles provide more accurate BFE data than the FIRM. The extent of
the 100- year floodplain and floodway must be depicted with a boundary line
on any site plans and shown in relation to existing and proposed structures or
development;
b. Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor, including
basement, of all new construction, substantial improvements or repairs to
structures that have sustained substantial damage;
c. Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential new
construction, substantial improvements or repair to structures that have
sustained substantial damage will be dry flood-proofed;
d. Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated
as a result of the proposed development. Computations by a registered
professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate that the altered or
relocated segment will provide equal or greater conveyance than the original
stream segment. The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
materials required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
in order to officially amend or revise the Flood Insurance Rate Map. The
applicant must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
The applicant must also provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of
the altered or relocated stream segment will be maintained;
e. A statement and supporting documentation (all costs of project, market value
of structure, etc.) verifying that the proposed alterations to an existing structure
meets or does not meet the criteria of the substantial improvement and/or
substantial damage definition. If a development meets the definition of
substantial improvement and/or substantial damage, the structure must be
brought into compliance with all floodplain regulations as if it was new
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-8
construction
f. Where applicable the following certifications by a registered professional
engineer or architect are required, and must be provided to the Planning and
Zoning Commission. The design and methods of construction must be
certified to be in accordance with accepted standards of practice and with the
provisions of §307.6.
(1) Non-residential flood-proofing must meet the provisions of §307.6(B);
(2) Fully enclosed areas below the base flood elevation (BFE) must meet the
minimum design criteria in §307.6(C);
(3) No (0.00) increase in floodway water surface elevations are allowed. Any
development in a floodway must meet the provisions of §307.6(E).
2. Construction Stage
Upon completion of the applicable portion of construction, the applicant shall provide
verification to the Planning and Zoning Commission of the following as is applicable:
1. Lowest floor elevation shall be verified for:
(a) A structure in Zones A and AE is the top of the lowest floor (including
basement);
(b) A non-residential structure which has been dry flood-proofed is the elevation
to which the flood-proofing is effective (Note: For insurance purposes, a dry
flood-proofed, non-residential structure is rated based on the elevation of its
lowest floor unless it is flood-proofed to one foot above the BFE.
2. Deficiencies detected by the review of the above listed shall be corrected by the
permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted
to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections
required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
307.3 Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Administrator
Duties of the Planning and Zoning Commission or its designee shall include, but not be
limited to:
A. Review all permit applications for completeness, particularly with the requirements of
§307.2.
B. Review all permit applications to determine whether the proposed development and
building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding.
C. Review all development permits to assure that the permit requirements of this
regulation have been satisfied.
D. Review all permit applications to assure that all necessary federal or state permits have
been received. Require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file
with the permit application. Such permits include, but are not limited to, Water

3-9
days prior to a public hearing if any change of regulation or use of a flood zone will
affect an area within five hundred (500) feet of another municipality.
F. Notify the adjacent communities and the Department of Energy and Environmental
Protection (DEEP), Inland Water Resources Division, prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
G. Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
H. Obtain, record and maintain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest
floor (including basement) of all new construction, substantial improvements or repair
to a structure that has sustained substantial damage.
I. Obtain, record and maintain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the
new construction, substantial improvement or repair to a structure that has sustain
substantial damage has been flood-proofed.
J. When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular structure, the Planning and Zoning
Commission or its designee shall obtain certification from a registered professional
engineer or architect, in accordance with §307.6(B).
K. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the area of
special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Planning and Zoning Commission
or its designee shall make necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location
of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in this regulation.
L. Require the applicant to provide base flood elevation data for all proposed
development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions.
M. When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance

demonstrating compliance with the approved plans and standards set forth in §307.2,
Subpart D.
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-10
307.4 Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
307.4.1 General Standards. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) the following
provisions are required:
A. New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have
sustained substantial damage shall be constructed using methods and practices
that minimize flood damage.
B. New construction, substantial improvements, and structures that have
sustained substantial damage shall be constructed with materials and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage.
C. New construction, substantial improvements, and repairs to structures that
have sustained substantial damage shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and
hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
D. New construction, substantial improvements and repair to structures that have
sustained substantial damage cannot be constructed or located entirely or
partially over water unless they are a functionally dependent use or facility.
E. Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, HVAC
ductwork, and other service facilities, or any machinery or utility equipment
or connections servicing a structure shall be elevated to or above the base flood
elevation (BFE) to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding. This includes, but is not limited to,
furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters,
ventilation ductwork, washer and dryer hook-ups, electrical junction boxes,
and circuit breaker boxes.
F. New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
G. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharges from
the system into flood waters.
H. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
I. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or
inside of the structure must either be elevated one (1) foot above the base flood
elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down
straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe
extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the
infiltration of flood water.
J. In any portion of a watercourse that is altered or relocated, the flood carrying
capacity must be maintained. Notify adjacent communities and the
Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP),
Inland Water Resources Division (IWRD) prior to any alteration or relocation
of a watercourse.
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-11
K. If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA),
the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must
meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes
any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure
attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more
restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of
the more restrictive zone.
L. If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards
of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., Structure must be
built one (1) foot above highest BFE). The structure includes any attached
additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the
main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will
require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive
zone.)
M. Compensatory Storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except
those areas which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction
caused by filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an
increase in footprint to the structure, shall be compensated for by deepening
and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless
easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be
provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used
for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal
to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including
the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed
project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic
connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can
be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.
N. Equal Conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are
tidally influenced, as designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for
the community, encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or
substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure,
are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered
professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in
flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land
adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage
shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood stage
or flood velocity.
307.5 Standards for Watercourses without Established Base Flood Elevations (unnumbered
A Zones), Adopted Floodways and/or Flood Mapping
A. The Planning and Zoning Commission or its designee shall require base flood elevation
(BFE) data be provided with any application for new construction, substantial
improvement, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other
development in Zone A without a FEMA-published BFE (un-numbered A Zone). The
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-12
Planning and Zoning Commission or its designee shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any BFE and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source,
including data developed for subdivision proposals, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained
substantial damage or other development in un-numbered A Zones on the communitys
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) meet the standards in §307.2(D) and §307.6. If no
BFE can be determined, the lowest floor, including basement, must be elevated to two
(2) feet above the highest adjacent grade next to the structure.
B. When BFEs have been determined within Zones AE on the communitys FIRM but a
regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Planning and Zoning Commission or
its designee must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, repair to
structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development, including
fill, shall be permitted which will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
more than one (1.0) foot at any point within the community when all existing and
anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.
C. The Planning and Zoning Commission or its designee may request floodway data of
an applicant for watercourses without FEMA-published floodways. When such data
is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is available from any other source
(in response to the municipalitys request or not), the community shall adopt a
regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey
the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than
one (1.0) foot at any point within the community.
D. The Planning and Zoning Commission or its designee shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any BFE and Floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, repair
to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other development in any
area of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding within the community meet the
standards in §307.2, Subpart D and 307.6.
E. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, §65.12, of the National Flood Insurance
Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones AE and
AH, on the communitys FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base
flood by more than one (1.0) foot, provided that the community first completes all of
the provisions required by §65.12.
307.6 Specific Standards: Construction Standards in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) -
Zones A and AE.
A. Residential Construction. All new construction, substantial improvements, and repair
to structures that have sustained substantial damage which are residential structures
shall have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot (1)
above the base flood elevation (BFE). Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility
equipment that service the structure must be elevated one foot (1) above the BFE.
B. Non-Residential Construction. All new construction, substantial improvements, and
repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage which are commercial,
industrial or non-residential structures shall:
1. Have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one (1) foot
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-13
above the base flood elevation (BFE); or
2. In lieu of being elevated, non-residential structures may be dry flood-proofed to
one (1) foot above the BFE provided that together with all attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
provided that such structures are composed of structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or
develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall
certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this section. Such
certification shall be provided to the Planning and Zoning Commission on the
FEMA Flood proofing Certificate, Form 81-65.
3. Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the
structure must be elevated one (1) foot above the BFE.
C. Fully Enclosed Areas Below The Base Flood Elevation of Elevated Buildings. All
new construction, substantial improvements, or repair of substantial damage to
residential or non-residential structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by a
foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor (below base flood elevation)
of an elevated building, shall be designed to preclude finished living space and be
designed to allow for the entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls (wet flood-proofing). Designs for complying
with this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, or meet the following minimum criteria listed in sections (1)-(7) below:
1. Provide a minimum of two (2) openings (hydraulic flood vents) having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding. These hydraulic openings must be located on at least two
different walls. Only the area (square footage) that lies below the BFE can be used
in the calculation of net area of vents required. If the structure has more than one
enclosed area, openings must be installed in the exterior walls of each enclosed
area so that flood waters can enter directly from the outside;
2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. At
least one side of the structures fully enclosed area must be at or above grade. Fill
placed around the foundation walls must be graded so that the elevation inside the
enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent outside elevation on at least
one side of the building. The finished floor of the enclosed area shall be no lower
than the bottom of the foundation openings. The foundation slab of a residential
structure, including the slab of a crawlspace, must be set equal to the outside
finished grade on at least one side of the building;
3. The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or
devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters in both
directions without any external influence or control such as human intervention,
including the use of electrical and other non-automatic mechanical means. Other
coverings may be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-14
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission;
4. The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the enclosed area shall be
the minimum necessary and shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, building
access or limited storage. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for the parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior
door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not
be used for human habitation or partitioned into separate rooms;
5. All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the BFE shall be
unfinished and resistant to flood damage;
6. Electrical, plumbing, HVAC ductwork, machinery or other utility equipment and
connections that service the structure (including, but not limited to, furnaces, oil
or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation,
washers, dryers, electrical junction boxes, circuit breaker boxes and food freezers)
are prohibited in the fully enclosed area below the BFE. Utilities or service
equipment located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the
space, will subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates.
7. A residential building with a structurally attached garage having the floor slab
below the BFE is considered an enclosed area below the BFE and must meet the
standards of sections (1)-(6) listed above. A garage attached to a residential
structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed
to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in both directions. Flood
openings or vents are required in the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage
doors. The human intervention necessary to open garage doors when flooding
occurs is not an acceptable means of meeting the openings requirements. In
addition to the automatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below BFE
must be constructed with flood resistant materials. Garages attached to nonresidential
structures must also meet the aforementioned requirements or be dry
flood proofed as per the requirements of §307.6(B).
D. Manufactured (Mobile) Homes and Recreational Vehicles (RVs).
1. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), any manufactured (mobile) homes to
be newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of
substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or
above the base flood elevation (BFE). The manufactured home must also meet all
the construction standards per §307.6. This includes SFHAs outside a
manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an
expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an
existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a
result of a flood.
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-15
2. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be placed on a permanent
foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely
anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures.
Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties
to ground anchors.
3. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be installed using methods
and practices which minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should
be provided. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed
no more than ten (10) feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for piers more than
six (6) feet above ground level.
4. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either (i) be on the site
for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for
highway use, OR (iii) meet all the general standards of §307.4.1 and the elevation
and anchoring requirement listed above for a manufactured home in §307.6(D). A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system,
is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions.
E. Floodways Located within Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are areas designated
as floodways on the communitys Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which
carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, no encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, repairs to substantially
damaged structures and other developments shall be permitted unless certification,
with supporting technical data, by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice, that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00
feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences in
the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design. A permit may
be given which allows encroachments resulting in increases in base flood elevations
provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the
requirements of C.F.R. 44, Chapter 1, §§65.12.
308 TEMPORARY METEOROLOGICAL TOWER
308.1 Temporary wind monitoring or meteorological towers shall be permitted in all zoning
districts for a period of no more than 180 consecutive days, subject to issuance of a Zoning
Permit by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
308.2 The standards applicable to such towers shall be the same as those for towers associated
with small wind energy facilities pursuant to §1019.2 of these Regulations.
309 TRAILER (CONSTRUCTION OFFICE/ CONSTRUCTION TRAILER )
One or more mobile office/storage trailers may be parked on a construction site temporarily (as set
forth below) provided the location of the trailers are shown on a Site Plan or Plot Plan approved by
the Commission, and the trailers are used exclusively for temporary office or storage space related
directly to construction activities on the same site. Under no condition shall a temporary
construction trailer be used as a residence, or remain on-site as a permanent structure for storage or
office use. A temporary construction trailer must be:
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-16
A. maintained in good, safe and secure condition;
B. removed from the site within 90 days if construction work on the site has not begun;
C. removed from the site within 30 days after construction work at the site is discontinued; or
D. removed from the site within 30 days after completion of all work on the site.
The Commission may grant up to a 60-day extension for extenuating circumstances, for any
deadline specified above.
310 UNREGISTERED MOTOR VEHICLE STORAGE AND OUTDOOR STORAGE OF JUNK AND DEBRIS
310.1 Temporary storage of unregistered motor vehicles shall be allowed as follows:
A. On all properties used for single-family or two-family residential purposes, one or two
unregistered or inoperable motor vehicles may be stored outside a building provided
that:
1. unregistered vehicles are stored in the side or rear yard and must not be visible
from the street;
2. the vehicles must be capable of being restored to running condition (i.e., a
condition suitable for use on public highways) within six months of the date on
which they were placed outside of a building on the lot; and
3. such storage shall be for a period of no longer than 180 days.
B. In all non-residential zones, storage of unregistered vehicles shall be allowed as an
accessory use only to businesses having the appropriate Department of Motor Vehicles
license.
310.2 Junk and Debris. Except as provided above, no waste or scrap material, debris, motor
vehicles that are partially or wholly dismantled, motor vehicle parts, abandoned machinery,
junk or similar unsightly material (see definition of junk in Chapter 16) shall be stored or
allowed to accumulate in any open space or in anything other than a completely enclosed
building on any lot in any district other than as may be permitted in an Industrial district.
This provision shall not apply to the temporary storage of waste material from a
construction operation being legally executed on the same premises.
311 YARD SALES
Yard Sales, garage sales, tag sales, and the like are permitted in any district provided there are no
more than three on the same lot in any calendar year and provided each such sale lasts no longer
than three consecutive days.
312 SIGNS
312.1 Purposes. These Sign Regulations are intended to:
A. preserve the public health and public safety by controlling the size, location and height
of signs so they will not confuse, distract, mislead or obstruct the vision necessary for
traffic safety; and
B. preserve the general welfare by controlling the physical condition of signs in order to
protect the character of each zone; mitigate any negative impacts on adjoining
properties; assist in achieving a more desirable environment in order to maintain
Chapter 3  General Provisions
3-17
property values; encourage economic growth; and avoid negatively altering the
essential characteristics of the area.
312.2 Sign Area Measurement. The sign area shall be the smallest area that encompasses all
letters, designs, symbols, and logos, including the advertising surface. The sign area shall
include any background material if such material is designed to be an integral part of the
sign because of its texture, color or building material.
A. For a sign painted on or applied to a building, the area shall be considered to include
all lettering, wording and accompanying designs or symbols, together with any
background of a color different from the natural color or finish material of the building.
B. For a sign consisting of individual letters or symbols attached to or painted on a surface,
building, wall or window, the area shall be considered to be that of the smallest
rectangle, triangle or circle that encompasses all the letters and symbols.
C. The area of any supporting framework (for example, brackets, posts, etc.) shall not be
included in the area, provided such framework is incidental to the display and contains
no advertising material or informational material other than a street name and number.
D. When a sign has two or more faces, the cumulative area of all faces shall be included
in determining the area, except where two faces are placed back to back and are at no
point more than two feet from each other. In that case, the sign area shall be taken as
the area of the larger of the two faces, or of one face if the two faces are equal in area.
E. The height of a sign shall be measured from the ground surface directly below the sign
up to the highest point of the display area of the sign or the supporting structure of the
sign. If the top of the sign and the top of the supporting structure are of unequal height,
the higher measurement shall determine the height.
312.3 Sign Illumination. Signs may be illuminated either externally or internally provided they
comply with the outdoor illumination standards in Chapter 11 and the limitations set forth
below.
A. Signs may not have flashing or intermittent lights, lighting of varying intensity, or
exposed neon lights. Internally lit LED and/or digital change copy signs are permitted
only in commercial and industrial zones, or for non-residential uses legally existing in
a residential zone.
B. No illuminated sign shall have exposed electrical wires.
C. No sign shall be illuminated between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. unless the
premises on which it is located is open for business at that time. This prohibition does

B. no sign shall obstruct free entrance or exit from a required door, window, or fire escape;
or be located or constructed in a manner that interferes with access by fire or emergency
personnel;
C. no sign shall be constructed or located in a manner that obstructs light or air into a
building or otherwise interferes with the proper functioning of a building; and
D. no sign shall be placed in such a location as to confuse or obstruct the view or
effectiveness of any traffic sign or signal or in any way result in a hazard to the safe
and efficient flow of vehicular traffic.
312.6 Prohibited Signs
The following signs are prohibited in all zoning districts.
A. Roof signs are prohibited.
B. Signs containing moving parts are prohibited.
C. Signs containing reflective elements that sparkle or twinkle in sunlight or artificial
light, or use the words "stop," "caution," or "danger," or incorporate red, amber, or
green lights resembling traffic signals, or resemble "stop" or "yield" signs in shape or
color are prohibited. Excepted from this prohibition are traffic, regulatory, or
informational signs required and approved by governmental agencies.
D. Portable or wheeled signs are prohibited. This is not intended to prohibit bumper
stickers or lettering on registered motor vehicles; however, vehicles or trailers having
such advertising shall not be used primarily for advertising, as opposed to
transportation. Portable signs of any type judged by the Commission to circumvent
these regulations are prohibited. For the purposes of these Regulations Portable Signs
do not include Sandwich Board or A-frame Signs.
E. Non-weatherproof signs, including signs made of cardboard, paper, or other
impermanent material, except for temporary signs not to exceed two days.

313 DRIVEWAYS
313.1 Residential Driveways. The following residential driveway design standards shall apply
to all driveways used for access to single-family and two-family homes. Driveways to
residential buildings containing three or more dwelling units must comply with the Towns
standards for road construction.
A. Spacing of Driveways. Driveway openings shall be separated by at least 30 feet, as
measured from curve return to curve return.
B. Shared Driveways
1. No more than two parcels shall share a residential driveway. A driveway serving
more than two single-family, duplex, or multi-family residences (or any
combination thereof) must comply with the Towns standards for road
construction.
2. The boundaries of the shared driveway must be defined by, and the rights and
duties of the respective users must be set forth in, a proper document or documents
(for example, an easement) filed in the Town land records. Such document(s)
must provide, at a minimum, a clear allocation of responsibility for maintenance
and repair of the driveway between or among the respective users.
3. The shared portion of any driveway must be an undivided part of one of the lots
it services.
C. Driveway Location. The proposed frontage must be capable of accommodating a
driveway for access to the main part of the lot (i.e., the portion of the lot containing the
principal use or structure) and meeting these Regulations minimum driveway
standards. A right-of-way and/or a portion of a right-of-way shall not be considered
part of the required frontage. The land on which the driveway is proposed to be located
to access the parcel must be an undivided part of the parcel being developed (i.e., it
must be owned in fee by the same person or persons who owns the remainder of the
lot) unless a shared driveway meeting the standards of §313.1.B is used.
D. Driveway Width. The dimensions of driveway widths, openings, and centerline curve
radii shall be as shown in the following table:

parcels. Turnouts shall also be provided as follows:
Turnout Spacing
Length Turnouts
Less than 400 feet None
400-800 feet One turnout within 150 feet of the dwelling unit.
More than 800 feet Every 400 feet
G. Driveway Grades. Driveways shall have a maximum grade of 12 percent for singlefamily
and duplex residences. When any portion of a driveway has a grade exceeding
8 percent, all abutting portions of the driveway having a grade greater than 6 percent
shall be paved. Driveways shall provide a reasonable transition in terms of grade
between the driveway and the gutter line.
H. Surface. Driveways serving single-family residences shall have an all-weather
surface capable of vehicle loading to an AASHTO H-20 rating of 32,000 lbs.
(14,500kgs.) per axle. A driveway detail shall be provided on Site Plan/Plot Plan
demonstrating compliance with this provision.
I. Drainage. Driveway design shall make adequate provision for drainage and
prevention of erosion. Drainage from driveways shall be diverted to roadside swales
or other appropriate drainage ways. Drainage from driveways shall not flow onto

500 RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
500.1 Purpose
These Residential Zoning Districts are established to provide for residential neighborhoods
that are in harmony with the natural features of the land and the needs of present and future
North Stonington residents.
500.2 Limitation of Principal Uses
A. Only one principal use shall be permitted on a residential lot, except that agricultural
uses may be permitted, subject to the requirements of Chapter 10, in addition to a
principal residential use or other agricultural uses on the same lot.
B. See §305.3.D of these Regulations regarding the possibility of dividing lots that are
currently nonconforming solely because they have more than one residential building.
500.3 Designation of Districts
[R-40] This Zoning District focuses on the village area and contains most of the Towns
higher residential densities, as well as most of the municipal facilities and
services. It is intended that residential growth be encouraged to locate in the
southern part of the Town, and particularly in this district, rather than in the
northern area that is remote from facilities and services.
[R-60] This area of the Town, together with the High-Density Residential Zoning
District, should attract the major part of the Towns expected growth. It, too, is
confined to the southern part of Town and has excellent road access.
[R-80] This Zoning District extends throughout the northern three quarters of the Town,
and it includes most of the Towns reserved open space, agriculture, and
numerous scenic and rugged topographic features worthy of preservation in their
natural state. The majority of this area is particularly remote from municipal
facilities and services and is very lightly developed at present. The major
objectives of these Regulations with regard to this district are to maintain the low
density of development in this area, encourage a continuation of agricultural
activities, and preserve the remote feel and rural character.
[SUOA] The Seasonal Use Overlay Area (SUOA) is designed to provide flexibility to
seasonal residential uses on small lots that were created before May 21, 1964.
501 DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS (See Chapter 4 for full details)
The following dimensional requirements shall apply to lots within the specified Zoning Districts,
except as may be otherwise expressly provided in these Regulations. The lot frontage requirements
specified below shall be applicable to all lots created after the specified frontage requirement was
enacted. However, no reduction may be made in the road frontage of any lot having less than the
frontage specified below.
Chapter 5  Residential Zoning Districts
5-2
* These standards apply only to the seasonal uses allowed in the SUOA district, as specified in § 704. Year-round uses in the SUOA
district must comply with the dimensional standards of the underlying zoning district.
502 PERMITTED AND SPECIAL PERMIT USES:
The following are permitted uses in the Residential Zoning Districts:
(Note: In the VPOA, no principal building or use shall be established or changed to another use without a Special Permit.)
Residential Principal Uses R-40 R-60 R-80
Single Family Residence: (Only one SF dwelling is permitted per lot, except in the case of
permitted accessory apartments. Quonset huts, Nissen huts, tents, camper trailers, and other
potentially movable shelters, whether or not affixed to a permanent (non-movable)
foundation, shall not be considered single-family dwellings for these purposes nor
permitted as a dwelling unit.

503 RESIDENTIAL ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES
A. The residential accessory uses listed in §502 shall require the permits specified in that section.
A Zoning Permit shall not be needed for all other residential accessory uses that do not require
an additional structure or a modification to an existing structure. All accessory structures or
modifications to existing structures require a Zoning Permit.
B. The parking or storage of large machinery not associated with a home occupation shall be
considered an accessory use, but may be located only in the side or rear yard. This restriction
shall not apply to farm equipment associated with a legally permitted agricultural use.
504 INTERIOR BUILDING LOT
Establishment of a building lot lacking the amount of frontage specified in §501 is permitted in all
Residential Zoning Districts, provided the following conditions are met.
A. The proposed Interior Building Lot must lie wholly within a Residential Zoning District, and
the principal use of the lot shall be limited to one single-family dwelling or one duplex dwelling
(and proper accessory uses).
B. Only one Interior Building Lot may be established through a division from the original tract.
Such original tract must be one that was separately described on the Towns land records as of
May 21, 1964. Following any such division, the remainder of the tract must be in conformance
with the dimensional requirements of the relevant zoning district.
C. Dimensions. Interior Building Lots shall have an area at least twice as large as that prescribed
in Chapter 4 for the zoning district. The front building line shall be at least fifty feet from the
Chapter 5  Residential Zoning Districts
5-4
corridor entry to the lot. The area contained in the frontage corridor shall not be considered in
the minimum area requirement.
D. Frontage Corridor. An Interior Building Lot shall have access to a public road via a land
corridor having a minimum width of 30 feet along its entire length. The frontage corridor shall
be an indivisible part of the Interior Building Lot.
E. Application. A Site Plan Application in conformance with all requirements set forth in Chapter
13 shall be required for the creation of any proposed Interior Building Lot. In addition to any
other requirements in that chapter, the applicant must submit one or more plans, maps, or other
information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with all provisions of this §504.
505 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT FOR OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION
505.1 The Commission may, by Special Permit, approve the subdivision of a parcel of land under
a cluster development plan, within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. §§8-2 and 8-18, when
at least one-third of the parcel would be permanently preserved as open space. The
application for a Special Permit for cluster development must include a proposed
subdivision plan demonstrating that cluster development of the parcel would meet all
applicable criteria for such Special Permit.
505.2 In addition to the criteria set forth in Chapter 13 for the issuance of a Special Permit, the
approval of a Special Permit for a cluster development shall require the Commission to
find:
a. that there will be a significant community benefit resulting from the additional open
space that is being preserved in perpetuity, such as protection of important natural,
scenic, agricultural, and historic resources; preservation of a sizable area of open space;
preservation of areas along Town or State roads that will protect rural appearance or
character; establishment of an open space corridor or greenway or interconnection of
existing open spaces; and/or provision for public access; and
b. that there will be an appropriate visual buffer or separation to adjacent existing
residential development; and
c. that the open space will not result in small or fragmented open space parcels that do
not provide community benefits.
505.3 When a Special Permit is approved for a cluster development, the dimensional
requirements of §501 shall be reduced as follows:
a. the minimum lot size requirement shall be decreased by the open space surplus
percentage, as defined in Chapter 16;
b. the minimum lot width and frontage shall be decreased by the open space surplus
percentage, provided that in no event shall a frontage lot in a residential subdivision
have less than 100 feet of frontage except as may be permissible under §504;
c. the maximum permissible lot coverage shall be increased by the open space surplus
percentage, provided that in no event shall the maximum land coverage for lots in a
cluster development exceed 20 percent;
d. the minimum setback and yard dimensions may be reduced by the open space surplus
percentage, provided that in no event shall the minimum setback and yard dimensions
be reduced by more than 30 percent; and
Chapter 5  Residential Zoning Districts
5-5
e. the minimum buildable area requirement shall be decreased by the open space surplus
percentage, provided that in no event shall such minimum be reduced below 25,600
square feet.
505.4 Any lot created by cluster development may be used solely for one single-family residence
or for one duplex residence (and proper accessory uses).

all work has been completed in strict accordance with such plan except as provided in
§705.14 below.
705.14 Revisions, Extensions, and Modifications
It is recognized that because of the complexity of Affordable Housing Development
projects, certain changes might occur in the development plan between that time when
Conceptual Site Plans are submitted and that time when all permits for construction are
granted. Therefore, the following provisions shall govern how revisions, extensions, and
modifications of approved plans shall be treated.
A. After approval is granted to those elements of the Affordable Housing Development
Overlay Zone approval described in §§ 705.13A & B herein, any revision, extension,
enlargement, movement or other change in the development of the site which results
in (1) increasing or decreasing land area; (2) increasing the number of units or
bedrooms; (3) increasing the non-residential building area; (4) decreasing buffer areas
by more than 10%; (5) and/or decreasing the percentage of Affordable Units (unless
applicant can demonstrate that the reduction was warranted due to unexpected site
conditions or other circumstances beyond their control), shall require the submission
of a new Affordable Housing Development Overlay Zone Application.
B. The Site Plan as described in §705.13C herein shall clearly indicate all changes
proposed subsequent to the approval of the Conceptual Site Plan. Commission
approval of a Site Plan shall act to establish those conditions shown thereon as the
required conditions, which must be met prior to the issuance of any Building Permits.
However, in no case shall the extent of the development exceed the limitations
established within §§705.3 through 705.10 herein, except in those cases where
modifications of these requirements are permitted as part of the Affordable Housing
Development Overlay Zone approval under the provisions of §§ 05.13C and 705.14
herein.
C. Once a Site Plan has been approved, any revision, extension, enlargement, movement
or other change in the development of the site which is proposed hereafter, and which
does not exceed the limitations established within §§705.3 through 705.10 herein, shall
require the submission of a revised Site Plan which shall be acted upon in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter 13 of these regulations. Such proposed modifications
may be permitted only if approved by the Commission. Any revised Site Plan shall
clearly indicate all changes proposed subsequent to the approval of the existing Site
Plan and approval by the Commission of a revised Site Plan shall act to establish the
conditions shown thereon as the required conditions, which must be met prior to the
issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
705.15 Enforcement. A violation of the Regulations contained in this §705 shall not result in a
forfeiture or reversion of title, but the Commission shall otherwise retain all enforcement
powers granted by the Connecticut General Statutes, including the authority under §8-12
to issue notices of violation, to impose fines, and to seek injunctive relief.
Chapter 7  Overlay Areas
7 - 10
Chapter 8 - Residential Special Zoning Districts
8 - 1
801 List of Residential Special Zoning Districts. The following districts are special zoning districts;
i.e., districts for which regulations have been established herein but which, as of the time of
adoption of these Regulations, had not yet been established on any specific land within the Town.
A. Senior Housing Community
802 SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITY (SHC)
802.1 Purpose. A Senior Housing Community may be approved as an overlay district in the R-
40, R-60, C, HC and ED Zoning Districts. An application for a Senior Housing Community
shall be processed in the same manner, and subject to the same standards, as a Design
Development Overlay district. The purpose of the Senior Housing Community (SHC)
regulations is to provide residential dwellings at a greater density than otherwise permitted
for residential use in the underlying zoning district(s) for persons aged 55 years and older,
with access to medical and/or healthcare facilities and services. Adequate restrictions must
be placed on the property to limit occupancy as described in §802.6.
802.2 Application Requirements. Applications for a Senior Housing Community shall be
submitted in accordance with the Design Development District (Master Planned
Development) requirements (§901).
802.3 Bulk and Area Requirements. It is the purpose of this section to permit variations in
height, bulk, density, and residential use types in order to meet the special needs of the
elderly and handicapped, and to permit flexible site design so that development may be
constructed in harmony with and preserve natural site features.
A. Minimum Parcel Size: 5 acres.
B. Maximum Building Height: 40 feet or three stories, whichever is less.
802.4 Maintenance. The applicant shall present sufficient information to the Commission to
demonstrate that adequate provisions have been made for the sustained maintenance of the
development in general and also for the sustained maintenance of the roads and open space.
802.5 Fire Protection. An applicant shall be required to provide an automatic fire suppression
system in all projects where more than one dwelling unit is contained within the same
building.
802.6 Age Restrictions
A. Each dwelling unit may be occupied only by:
1. persons who are 55 years of age or older;
2. a spouse of, or a person joined in a civil union (civil union partner) to, a person
who is 55 years of age or older and who lives in the same unit;
3. an occupant who survives a spouse or civil union partner who resided at the same
unit immediately prior to his or her death;
4. an occupant whose spouse or civil union partner resided in the same unit
immediately before entering into a long-term continuing care facility;
5. children 21 years of age or older of a parent residing in the same unit; or
6. a paid caregiver of a person who is 55 years of age or older and who lives in the
same unit.
Chapter 8 - Residential Special Zoning Districts
8 - 2
B. In no event may a dwelling unit be occupied by more than four residents.
C. The proposed development shall be a Common Interest Ownership Community as
defined in Chapter 828 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
Chapter 9 - Business Special Zoning Districts
9-1
900 List of Business Special Zoning Districts. The following districts are special Zoning Districts;
i.e., Districts for which regulations have been established herein but which, as of the time of
adoption of these Regulations, had not yet been established on any specific land within the Town.
A. Design Development District (Master Planned Development)
B. Vacation Resort District (Master Planned Development)
901 DESIGN DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (MASTER PLANNED DEVELOPMENT)
901.1 Intent. To encourage commercial and mixed use development that reflects the vision of
the Town with respect to attracting quality development and that respects the New England
character of North Stonington, while allowing for creative design that maximizes the
economic viability and flexibility for future reuse. A Design Development District may be
approved only in the C, ED and HC Zoning Districts, except that, if any portion of a current,
legally existing lot is located within the ED, a DDD may incorporate the entire lot.
901.2 The purposes of a Design Development District are:
A. to provide flexibility in uses and site design, maximizing development potential while
ensuring aesthetically pleasing commercial and mixed use development;
B. to extend greater opportunities for traditional community living, working, housing, and
recreation to all residents of the Town;
C. to encourage a more efficient use of land and public services by promoting compact
development in appropriate locations; and
D. to provide a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, civic and open space uses.
901.3 The goal of this § 901 is to provide a process by which developers and Commission
members can collaborate on the design of a site and arrive at a final project that is both
successful for the developer and sustainable for the Town. The permitting process will
consist of three steps.
A. Informal workshop to discuss initial concepts and ideas. Some basic concept plans
should be provided to aid the discussion.
B. Approval of Master Plan and Zoning Map amendment.
C. Site Plan/Special Permit Approval (depending on the proposed uses).
901.4 Relationship to Zoning Regulations
A. Unless provided otherwise in this § 901, uses within the Design Development District
(Master Planned Development) shall be subject to all provisions and definitions of
these Regulations. However, because the intent of the DDD is to provide flexibility in
design standards in order to achieve important design objectives as described herein,
in cases of conflict with other provisions of these Regulations including the zoning
definitions, the provisions of this § 901 shall prevail.
B. As part of a Master Plan, the applicant may propose one or more modifications of any
of these Regulations that would otherwise be applicable to the underlying Zoning
District. A list of such proposed modifications must accompany the application. If the
Commission decides to approve the application to establish the DDD, it may accept,
modify and accept, or deny any of the proposed modifications. Any modifications
Chapter 9 - Business Special Zoning Districts
9-2
approved by the Commission in establishing a DDD shall be deemed to be the
regulations applicable to the DDD and shall supersede any contrary regulations for the
underlying Zoning District(s). The regulations for the underlying zoning districts shall
continue to apply to the DDD except as so modified.
C. For the purposes of this § 901, the term Master Plan shall include all elements of the
Application Requirements contained herein: i.e., the Master Plan,
Comprehensive Traffic Study, Comprehensive Stormwater Management Study,
Documentation of the Availability of Potable Water and Sanitary Sewer Service, and
the Design Guidelines, including the Pattern Book.
D. The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing in this § 901.4 shall be construed to prevent
review under the requirements and criteria of Chapter 13 of these Regulations for any
Special Permit application pursuant to § 901 that addresses a level of detail for that
Special Permit application that was not addressed in the approval of the Master Plan
and its accompanying studies. Similarly, nothing in this section shall be construed to
prevent such review for any elements of the Special Permit that differ from the
approved Master Plan. The intent of this section is that any compliance issues that can
be addressed at the level of detail afforded by the Master Plan shall not be revisited in
the individual Special Permit applications filed in compliance with such Master Plan,
while not precluding the Commission from examining the more detailed plans of the
Special Permit application in conformance with the criteria of these Regulations that
are appropriate to such detailed level of review.
901.5 Permitted Uses (SPL). Office, retail, general commercial, hospitality, personal and
professional services, manufacturing, civic, open space, and residential uses may all be
permitted in a DDD as part of a well-designed, mixed-use development that provides a
reasonable mix and balance of such uses.
901.6 Conditional Uses (SPP)
The following uses in a DDD shall require a Special Permit:
a. single-family detached housing units;
b. any commercial office or research and development use that utilizes, processes, or
manufactures chemicals or any hazardous materials;
c. drive-through windows;
d. commercial greenhouses and similar agriculturally related commercial businesses; and
e. any use in the underlying zoning district(s) that requires a Special Permit.
901.7 Design
The following regulations apply to all DDDs.
A. All uses shall employ Sustainable Development practices in accordance with § 1102
of the Zoning Regulations, including but not limited to low impact development
techniques.
B. Site design shall aim to maintain as much of the natural topography and vegetation
and, wherever possible, developments shall be internalized with no front-yard parking.
C. All utilities shall be located underground.
D. Shared and on-street parking is encouraged for residential units.
Chapter 9 - Business Special Zoning Districts
9-3
E. Total size of such a development shall be regulated by the ability to provide adequate
water and wastewater disposal in accordance with the public health code.
F. The maximum building height in any DDD shall be 50 feet or three stories, whichever
is less, except where the Commission finds that a greater height would add to the
overall architectural character, detail and vernacular style of a proposed structure. Any
proposal for such increased height must be referred to the Towns Fire Chief for review
and comment. No increase in height shall be permitted to provide additional habitable
space.
G. A Connecticut Licensed Landscape Architect shall be required to design, certify, and
sign the site development plans in association with the other necessary design
professionals. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate to the
Commission that the site design requirements have been met or exceeded.
901.8 Application Elements
The following application elements must be prepared, and all graphical plans signed and
sealed, by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Connecticut.

zoning districts but that the applicant proposes to modify for the DDD.
901.9 Approval Considerations
As an exercise of its legislative authority, the Commission may approve, approve with
modifications, or deny any application for a DDD. The Commission may also require that
certain amenities, such as improved or natural open space areas or community facilities, be
allocated to particular phases of the development so as to ensure that such amenities
proceed apace with the other components of the development. The Commission may also
require that each phase contain a minimum number or type of uses to assure that the initial
phases, standing alone, will further the purposes of the DDD as set forth in § 901; and may
require that certain buildings or certain uses within a phase receive Building Permits and
be under construction before future phases may commence construction. In considering
any application for a DDD, the Commission shall make a finding that the Master Plan,
including Master Stormwater Drainage Study, Master Parking Study, Phasing Plan, Master
Traffic Study and Design Guidelines, is consistent with the standards and purposes of a
DDD set forth in this section; and, in addition, with those criteria set forth in § 1102
(Sustainable Development) and § 1303 (Special Permit) of these Regulations that are
applicable to the Master Plan level of detail per § 901.4.D This reference to § 1303 shall
Chapter 9 - Business Special Zoning Districts
9-6
not be construed to require plans or other materials at that level of detail required for a
Special Permit application at the Master Plan approval stage.
901.10 Filing of Approved Master Plan and Zoning Map Amendment. Following approval of
a DDD, the Master Plan, together with the approved Master Parking Study, Master Traffic
Study, Phasing Plan, Master Stormwater Drainage Study, and Design Guidelines, shall be
filed in the office of the clerk of the Town of North Stonington.
901.11 Modification of Approved Master Plan. Approved DDD Master Plans may be modified
by the Commission in accordance with procedures pertinent to the nature of the proposed
modification. For instance, applications to modify the applicable regulations shall be
reviewed pursuant to § 1304; applications to modify any use requiring a Special Permit
shall be reviewed pursuant to § 1303; and so forth.
901.12 Expiration of DDO District. Site Plan and/or Special Permit approval for at least the first
phase of an approved DDDmust be obtained no later than five years following the approval
of the DDD Master Plan or, in the event of an appeal of such approval, within five years
following the final adjudication of the appeal that the DDD is valid (final approval). All
components of the DDD shall be completed no later than ten years after final approval of
the DDD, provided that the Commission may grant extensions of time where the developer
demonstrates that it is making a good faith effort to complete the development and there
are no outstanding violations of these Regulations or the Inland Wetlands and
Watercourses Regulations with respect to the DDD. Any failure to meet these deadlines
shall result in the expiration of the Master Plan, which shall become null and void. The
Commission shall place a notice of any such expiration, on the land records of the Town.
901.13 Special Permit Review. Following approval of a DDD Master Plan, all applications for
Site Plan and/or Special Permit approval for the structures and other improvements within
such Plan shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to the following process:
A. Informal Review. All applicants are encouraged to review all Site Plan and/or Special
Permit applications with Commission staff on an informal basis prior to the filing of
any application.
B. Application Process
1. Applications for Special Permit approval in a DDD must be filed with the
Commission and conform to § 1303 of these Regulations, except as provided
otherwise in this § 901 (see especially subsection C, below). Each proposed use,
Site Plan, building or structure, and other component of the application shall
include all structures and other improvements within the entire Master Plan or
within a project phase as approved by the Commission as part of its approval of
the Master Plan, and shall substantially conform to such Master Plan.
2. The Commission shall conduct a public hearing on any application for Special
Permit approval in accordance with the provisions of §§ 1303 and 1306.
C. Application Requirements. All applicants for Site Plan or Special Permit approval
shall provide the application materials required by §1302 and § 1303 respectively. The
following additional information shall also be submitted.
1. Statement of Consistency with Plans, Studies and Guidelines. A statement
shall be provided demonstrating reasonable consistency with the following
Chapter 9 - Business Special Zoning Districts
9-7
documents that were approved as part of the DDD application, and identifying any
deviations from the Master Plan and the reasons for such deviations:
a. Master Plan
b. Master Parking Study
c. Master Traffic Study
d. Master Stormwater Draining Study
e. Design Guidelines
If the Commission determines that changes have been made to the Master Plan,
including without limitation the size, density, mix of uses, site layout, appearance,
and/or design of the development that affect the applications fulfillment of the
objectives of the DDD, the application may be denied as being not reasonably
consistent with the Master Plan. In such instance, the applicant may file a revised
Special Permit application or an application to amend the Master Plan.
2. The applicant shall submit a Permanent Maintenance Plan that establishes a
yearly schedule of maintenance activities to ensure the aesthetic quality and
cleanliness of the site. The maintenance plan shall include, but not be limited to,
a timetable for all maintenance activities with respect to private storm drainage
systems, utilities and other infrastructure including, but not limited to, landscaping
and screening, roads, parking areas, sidewalks, trails and berms, lighting, signage,
storage, refuse and litter control, snow removal and other site amenities proposed
in the plans. If the development is intended to be a common interest ownership
community pursuant to the Common Interest Ownership Act (the Act), the
applicant shall submit proposed language to be included in the Declaration of the
community under the Act, binding each unit owner and the unit owners
association to the requirements of the approved maintenance plan. If the
development is intended to be something other than a common interest ownership
community, the applicant shall submit a document legally sufficient to assure
future maintenance of the DDD infrastructure, as described above.
902 VACATION RESORT DISTRICT (VRD)
902.1 Intent: To facilitate a coordinated area of luxury accommodations and amenities that
promote the enjoyment of the area's natural features and harmonize with the existing
residential uses, and to allow for creative design that maximizes the economic viability and
flexibility for future reuse. A Vacation Resort District may be approved only in the RC
zoning district.
902.2 The goal of this § 902 is to provide a process by which developers and Commission
members can collaborate on the design of a site and arrive at a final project that is both
successful for the developer and sustainable for the Town. The permitting process will
consist of three steps.
A. Informal workshop to discuss initial concepts and ideas. Some basic concept plans
should be provided to aid the discussion.
B. Approval of Master Plan and Zoning Map amendment.
C. Site Plan/Special Permit Approval (depending on the proposed uses).
Chapter 9 - Business Special Zoning Districts
9-8
902.3 Permitted Uses. All uses permitted in the RC Zone shall be permitted in a VRD as part of
a well-designed, mixed-use development that shall be identified as a Vacation Resort
Complex. The Complex may be owned and managed by one person or family, partnership,
or corporation, including condominium ownership, and shall contain a reasonable mix and
balance of dwelling units and/or guest rooms and recreational activities intended for the
primary use of its guests, administrative facilities, and maintenance and storage facilities.
A resort may also furnish services which may cater to other guests not staying at the resort
such as retail, restaurant, cocktail lounge, and convention facilities.
902.4 Minimum Lot size shall be twice that of the underlying RC Zoning District.
902.5 Application Procedure and Relationship to Zoning Regulations. With the exception of
Sections 901.1-901.3, 901.5- 901.6, and 901.7F, all requirements and procedures outlined
in Section 901 applicable to a DDO shall also apply to a Vacation Resort District.
Chapter 10  Supplemental Regulations
10 - 1
The following regulations are supplemental to uses identified with an * listed in Chapters 5 and 6.
1001 AGRICULTURE
Preserving the Towns existing farms and encouraging new farming activities are strong goals of
the Town. North Stoningtons farms are central to the communitys rural image and overall value
by providing many obvious benefits such as providing tax revenue with little demand on Town
services; providing wildlife habitats and tracts of open space, essential to maintaining the high
quality of life enjoyed by Town residents; and by providing local produce, meat and dairy products
year round. The purpose of these regulations is to clearly define agriculture and to promote the
economic and operational viability of existing agricultural operations while facilitating and
promoting new operations.
Agriculture is permitted in the R40, R60, R80 and I Zoning Districts as a principal use or in
addition to any existing permitted principal use.
1001.1 Definitions
See Chapter 16 under Agriculture for various definitions relating to agriculture and
farming. All such terms are considered agricultural uses and may require permits.
1001.2 Application Requirements
The following activities/uses require a Zoning Permit and/or Commission review:
A. the establishment of a new agricultural principal use as defined in §1600;
B. the expansion or modification of an existing farm/agricultural operation;
C. Special Agricultural Buildings (see §1001.6);
D. the excavation of farm ponds (see §1006);
E. the construction of any new structures on a property;
F. accessory uses and activities specifically identified in §§1001.3 (A  E); and
G. any other use/activity specifically identified as requiring a permit.
1001.3 Accessory uses (Ag-tivities, tourism, retail). The following activities are considered to
be accessory to an established agriculture operation. For accessory uses and activities that
may currently or in the future involve outdoor events, retail sales, and/ or potential trafficgenerating
activities, a Zoning Permit and/or Commission review is required.
A. Agricultural Tourism. The opening to the public of a working farm or any
agricultural, horticultural or agribusiness operation for the purpose of enjoyment,
education, or active involvement in the activities of the farm or operation. A Site Plan
review (SPL) shall be required when agricultural tourism is to be conducted on any
parcel six or more times in any calendar year, or when any agricultural tourism event
may reasonably be expected to require parking on any single day for ten or more motor
vehicles used by agricultural tourists. Otherwise, agricultural tourism requires only a
Zoning Permit (ZP).
B. Ag-tivities. Events of limited duration on a farm that are incidental to agricultural uses,
including (but not limited to) hayrides, corn mazes, festivals and other similar
activities; on-farm sales such as farm stands and pick-your-own operations, retailing
farm and farm-related products (farm store); recreational and/or competitive equine
enterprises, and on-farm processing operations provided they comply with all
applicable state and municipal health codes. A Site Plan review (SPL) shall be required
Chapter 10  Supplemental Regulations
10 - 2
when Ag-tivities are to be conducted on any parcel six or more times in any calendar
year, or when any Ag-tivities may reasonably be expected to require parking on any
single day for ten or more motor vehicles used by visitors to the farm. Otherwise, Agtivities
require only a Zoning Permit (ZP). Note: A temporary event permit may also
be required from the Board of Selectmen.
C. Non-agriculturally Related Uses. Activities that are part of an agricultural
operations overall offerings, but are not incidental to agriculture, or tied to agricultural
buildings, structures, equipment, and/or fields. Such uses may include, but are not
limited to, fee-based outdoor recreation such as bird watching, snow-shoeing, and other
passive recreational activities. A Site Plan review (SPL) shall be required when such
uses may reasonably be expected to require parking for ten or more motor vehicles
used by visitors to the farm. Otherwise, such uses require only a Zoning Permit (ZP).
Small Event Barns for (but not limited to) retreats, weddings, workshops, classes (i.e.
yoga, canning, wool dying etc.) are permitted by SPL, but no outdoor events or
amplified music are permitted and adequate parking must be available on site to
accommodate all expected motor vehicles.
Event Barns to be used for large-scale events, or any events in which the use of
amplified music is planned or anticipated, require a Special Permit. In order to satisfy
the conditions of a Special Permit with respect to noise, the Commission may limit the
number of events per year and/or prohibit the use of amplified music outdoors. The
Commission may impose additional restrictions on the use if it determines, after a
hearing for which the owner of the farm is given written notice that the noise levels are
causing a nuisance to nearby properties.
D. Farm-Brewery (SPL)
A Farm Brewery shall be considered to be accessory to an established agricultural
operation if the farmer makes and sells beer (including hard cider) from ingredients
primarily grown on the farm. A Farm Brewery is permitted wherever agriculture is
permitted [Note: A Brew Pub would fall under Hospitality Uses, permitted in nonresidential
Zones per §602]. In addition to the requirements of Site Plan approval, the
following additional regulations shall apply.
1. The brewery shall be considered a Pilot or Nano brewery if it has production

provide an ornamental landscaped area along the perimeter of the property, excluding areas
specifically reserved for vehicular or pedestrian access or for other accessory uses
designated on the proposed Site Plan. The landscaped areas shall be a minimum of ten feet
in width and shall be designed with a combination of grass, shrubs, flower, shade trees and
other vegetative materials skillfully designed to provide a visual landscaped buffer between
adjacent properties and to enhance the aesthetic appearance of the district.
1103.4 Landscape Buffer Requirements. When a Site Plan or Special Permit application is
submitted for the establishment of a new use, and the parcel is abutted either (1) by any
Residential Zoning District or (2) by any existing use that would be allowable as of right
or with Site Plan review in a Residential district, a landscaped buffer no less than 25 feet
in width shall be provided along all such abutting portions of the perimeter. Such buffers
shall be designed to provide appropriate screening to minimize any potential negative
impacts of noise, light, dust, vibrations, hours of operation, and substantially dissimilar
aesthetics. Due consideration should be given to the character of existing districts and uses
in determining the density and intensity of techniques and materials needed to provide
adequate, aesthetically pleasing, year-round screening. In the RC Zoning District, buffers
shall be increased to 50 feet for all Commercial Recreational facilities along any property
line that abuts a residential district. In the case of a Master Plan Approval per Section 902,
the Commission may increase but cannot decrease the 50-foot buffer requirement.
1103.5 Completion of Landscaping. All landscaping shown on the approved Site Plan shall be
completed before issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy unless the landowner provides
surety, in a form and amount satisfactory to the Commission, assuring completion within
a specific time, not to exceed one year. Such surety shall be forfeited if the work shall not
have been completed within such time limit.
1104 PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN STANDARDS
1104.1 Application and Scope. For any use hereafter established, off-street parking and loading
shall be provided in accordance with this §1104.
1104.2 Maintenance Required. All spaces required to be provided per this §1104 shall be
permanently maintained and made available for occupancy in connection with, and for the
full duration of, the use of land or structure(s) for which such spaces are required.
1104.3 Change of Use. Any change of use or the addition of one or more uses to an existing use
shall require that the aggregate off-street parking specified in this §1104 be provided. If
such changes are proposed in connection with an existing use that is already nonChapter
11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 3
conforming with respect to parking requirements, such existing use(s) shall also be brought
into compliance at such time.
1104.4 Number and Size of Parking and Loading Spaces and Berths. Plans for all existing
and proposed uses shall provide sufficient on-site parking to accommodate the motor
vehicles of all occupants and visitors that may reasonably be expected at any one time, and
sufficient loading berths to accommodate the anticipated needs of all planned uses. The
standards set forth in §1104.5, §1104.7, §1104.8, and §1104.9 shall be deemed to specify
the necessary and appropriate number and size of parking and loading spaces, berths and
areas in the absence of any contrary evidence. However, as part of a proposed Site Plan,
an applicant may submit evidence that the same or similar uses can be reasonably
accommodated with fewer or smaller spaces or berths, or that more or larger spaces or
berths will be needed. The Commission shall weigh the credibility of any such evidence in
deciding whether the proposed parking and loading plans are adequate.
1104.5 Parking Ratios. The following off-street parking ratios shall apply to all uses and
combinations of uses in the absence of any contrary evidence provided in accordance with
§1104.4. If the proposed number of parking spaces is greater than ten percent (10%) above
the minimum number of spaces required by this §1104.5, and any such spaces are located
outside of a parking garage, the applicant must demonstrate, in accordance with §1104.4,
why so many spaces would be necessary or desirable. For purposes of the following ratios,
the term maximum shift means the time or times during which the greatest number of
workers (including management, staff, and all other persons employed by the relevant
business) are located at the site on a regular (but not necessarily daily) basis. When the
calculation results in a fraction, the number shall be rounded to the next highest whole
number. The abbreviation GFA means gross floor area.
A. Motor Vehicle Sales/Service. One space per employee on the maximum shift, plus
one space per 500 square feet of internal display area, plus one space per 2,000 square
feet of outdoor display area, plus two spaces per service bay.

1104.6 Uses Not Listed
The minimum number of parking spaces required for certain uses not listed above are set
forth elsewhere in these Regulations. If no minimum number of parking spaces has been
established in these Regulations for a particular use, the minimum number shall be
determined by the Commission based on such evidence as may be provided or available in
the record. An applicant for any such use must submit sufficient information to the
Commission to allow it to estimate the number of motor vehicles of all occupants and
visitors that may reasonably be expected at any one time. Such information may include,
without limitation, evidence regarding the nature, intensity, and mix of the proposed use;
projected attendance figures; the number of anticipated employees, visitors or customers;
and the experience of similar facilities elsewhere. The Commission may deny an
application that fails to provide sufficient, credible information to enable the Commission
reasonably to determine the number of parking spaces likely to be required. The
Commission may, alternatively, require the applicant to designate an overflow-parking
area in the event the parking plan results in insufficient spaces.

Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 6
D. Where parking spaces abut a concrete or bituminous walk (minimum six feet in width),
the depth of the parking space may be reduced by two feet.
E. Reduction in parking facilities
1. Permanent shared use reduction. The Commission may permit a reduction of up
to 25% of the required parking spaces due to shared use of parking facilities when
the parking needs of the uses occur at different hours of the day.
2. Permanent compact space reduction. In parking lots in excess of 50 spaces, the
Commission may allow the installation of compact spaces, not to exceed 25% of
the total number of spaces installed, at 8 feet x 16 feet. These spaces shall be clearly
designated as compact-car parking.
F. Parking Lot and Driveway Design
1. In order to protect the public safety, where traffic volumes, patterns or street
geometry warrants, the Commission may require that only one driveway serve any
lot, regardless of the length of street frontage, and may designate the location of
any driveway. In the case of corner lots, driveways shall be located not less than
150 feet from the intersection of the street lines of the lot. In the case of a corner
lot having frontage of less than 150 feet, the driveway shall be as far from the
intersection as is practical. Driveways entering streets at a curve or near the crest
of a hill shall be located to provide the maximum sight distances possible.
2. Driveways shall be designed to be as perpendicular to the street line as possible,
and in no case may the angle between the street line and the driveway centerline
be less than 60 degrees.
3. Parking lots designed for 90-degree parking are encouraged and may be required
by the Commission. However, where a one-way circulation pattern is desired due
to traffic safety considerations, the Commission may require angle parking.
4. Parking lot aisles longer than 45 feet may not be dead-ended and must provide
continuous circulation unless the Commission finds that sufficient turnaround
areas and adequate overall site circulation has been provided.
5. For any use requiring Site Plan approval, the applicant must consider the use of
pervious material for surfacing all external parking areas. The Commission may
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 7
require the use of pervious materials if it determines that such materials would be
desirable for groundwater recharge or stormwater management.
6. No parking area or driveways shall be closer than ten feet from any portion of a
building other than its garage entrance or loading area apron. This ten-foot area
may be used for walkways and/or landscaping.
7. See §1105 for additional requirements for non-residential uses.
1104.9 Parking for Buses and other Large Vehicles
A. In addition to the required automobile parking, a minimum of one bus parking space
shall be provided for every 40 units in a hotel and for every 80 seats in a restaurant,
except that, if a restaurant is an accessory use to a hotel, the number of bus parking
spaces shall be determined by the greater of the two requirements.
B. Minimum bus parking space dimensions shall be 10 feet wide x 40 feet long.
C. The Commission may require additional parking spaces that can accommodate larger
vehicles that include, but are not limited to, shuttle vans or limousines that may be
typically associated with the proposed use, or expected to be parked on site.
1104.10 Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements. Any lot that contains parking facilities for
more than ten cars shall provide landscaped end islands and landscaped center islands
within the parking area. Such islands shall be designed and located to maximize the
attractiveness of parking lots by providing ornamental landscaped areas and shade. The
design of such islands must assure adequate circulation, aesthetic appeal, shade, and
capacity for snow storage as a result of plowing.
1105 ACCESS MANAGEMENT
1105.1 Purpose. This section is intended to control the number, size, and location of driveways
and access points for business uses in order to promote overall traffic control and promote
public safety and welfare.
1105.2 Commercial Access
A. Commercial access is defined as an access way providing a vehicular connection from
a public or private roadway to a parking area serving commercial, recreational,
institutional, office, multi-family, mixed use, or industrial land uses.
B. Commercial access shall be designed to be as perpendicular to the street line as
possible, and in no case may the angle between the street line and the access-way
centerline be less than 60 degrees.
C. No commercial access shall be located within 100 feet of the rotary (curve radius) of
Route 184 and Route 2.
D. Sightline Distance. Access shall be designed and located to provide a minimum sight
distance, clear of all obstructions, natural or man-made, of 250 feet in either direction
on secondary roads, 325 feet on primary roads, and 375 feet on primary and secondary
arterial roads, as listed in Appendix B.
E. Connection to Roads. The portion of driveway through the right-of-way connecting
the property with the physical roadway shall be the shortest perpendicular distance
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 8
possible. Any grading, filling, or drainage design in the right-of-way shall require a
Zoning Permit (unless the access is part of a road approved as part of a subdivision)
and the approval of the Town.
F. Commercial access shall be placed so the following minimum distances are
maintained to any street intersection, including a T-intersection on the opposite side of
the street from a property where access is proposed.
1. Local access or low volume road: a minimum distance of 50 feet shall be
maintained from the driveway curve return to the edge of the right-of-way at the
intersection.
2. Primary road or larger road: a minimum distance consisting of the left turn
stacking distance (described below) plus 20 feet, as measured from the intersection
curve return to the driveway curve return, shall be maintained.
3. The left turn stacking distance shall be calculated using the following formula
(or based on a traffic study, if available or required).
a. Peak Hour Traffic = Average daily traffic/10
b. Peak hour left turns = 1/6 of peak hour traffic for 4-way intersections
c. Peak hour left turns = ¼ of peak hour traffic for T-intersections
d. Driveway to intersection spacing = [1.5 x peak hour left turns x 20 feet] + 20
feet.
4. Intersection Spacing:
1105.3 Frontage Requirements. The projects frontage may be traversed by not more than one
driveway, unless the Commission finds that more than one driveway is desirable for safety
reasons. Applicants are encouraged to arrange common accesses with adjoining properties,
and the Commission may approve temporary access designs when a more desirable
permanent access serving more than one property appears achievable in the future.
1105.4 Traffic and Access. Access to the lot and internal circulation shall be designed so as to
promote the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, both on the lot and off site. The Site
Plan shall be evaluated on the following basis:
A. the effect of the development on traffic on adjacent streets;
B. circulation pattern of vehicular and pedestrian traffic on the site;
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 9
C. provision for parking and loading;
D. adequacy of sight lines;
E. relationship of the proposed circulation to circulation on adjacent property, for both
vehicles and pedestrians, with special attention to promoting pedestrian traffic among
adjacent parcels; and
F. emergency vehicle access.
1105.5 Access Driveway Design.
A. Driveway Widths. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided. Oneway
driveways, access ways, thoroughfares, entrances, and exits for nonresidential use
shall have a minimum width of 12 feet. Two-way driveways, access ways,
thoroughfares, entrances, and exits for nonresidential use shall have a minimum width
of 24 feet. An access way may be configured as a boulevard so long as each entrance
and exit lane is a minimum width of 15 feet, and the median design is appropriately
landscaped.
B. Driveways shall not be located within ten feet of a side or rear property line abutting a
lot that is in a Residential Zoning District or that is used for single-family or two-family
residential purposes.
C. In Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts, parking areas, parking spaces, and
internal access drives may be located within half of the required front yard setback
area, when screened from the street and abutting property by landscape materials,
including trees, shrubs and/or earthen berms.
D. Curbing. The front or primary driveway, entrance, and exit shall be lined, for its entire
length on both sides, with curbing of granite or Portland cement concrete unless the
Stormwater Management Plan demonstrates that stormwater will be properly
controlled without such curbing.
E. Surface treatment. All parking spaces, loading facilities, and access roadways shall
have at least six inches of process stone and 2½ inches of bituminous concrete as
surface treatment unless the applicant can demonstrate that an alternate treatment
would provide an adequate all-weather surface consistent with LID techniques.
F. Grade. Driveways serving commercial or industrial uses shall have a maximum grade
of six percent (6%). Driveways shall provide a reasonable transition in terms of grade
between the driveway and the gutter line. The driveway shall maintain a grade equal
to or less than the crown slope of the road from the point where the driveway meets
the road right-of-way to where the driveway crosses the gutter line. This transition is
needed to eliminate plows catching their blades on driveways with abrupt grade
changes in the vicinity.

handicapped persons shall be provided in all parking lots in accordance with all
applicable state and federal laws and regulations.
H. Modification of Site Plans. The Commission may require the modification of any Site
Plan if it finds such modifications necessary to satisfy the requirements of these
Regulations. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. closing existing curb cuts, limiting proposed curb cuts, or closing temporary curb
cuts when alternative access points become available;
2. limiting turning movements to right turns in or out of curb cuts;
3. aligning access drives or roads with opposing access drives or roads wherever
practical;
4. limiting direct access to Route 2 when a parcel has frontage on an adjacent street
or highway.
1106 REFUSE STORAGE
1106.1 Purpose. This section is intended to control the number, size, location, and screening of
refuse storage areas in order to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
1106.2 Requirements.

not exceed 200 square feet.
1109 ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER, AND HISTORIC AND LANDSCAPE PRESERVATION
1109.1 General Provisions. The overall character of the proposed site layout and the architectural
character of proposed structures shall be designed, to the extent feasible, to protect property
values in the neighborhood and the Town; preserve the existing historic character in terms
of scale, density, architecture, and materials used in construction of all site features; protect
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 12
the existing historic patterns of arrangement of structural and natural features, including
circulation patterns; and preserve public access to scenic views and vistas and to water
courses.
1109.2 Architectural Characteristics
In the interest of general welfare and to stabilize and protect property values, applicants are
encouraged to respect the New England character of North Stonington. Architectural styles
typical in the Town of North Stonington include the following.
1. Early colonial
2. Georgian
3. Federal
4. Jeffersonian (commercial or public building only)
5. Greek Revival
6. Gothic Revival
7. Italianate
8. Stick Style
9. Shingle Style
10. Bungalows
11. Period houses
12. International Style
1109.3 Encouraged Materials and Practices
A. Materials, texture, and color used on the exterior walls and roof should emphasize the
use of natural materials or should be those associated with traditional New England
architecture. Preferred façade materials are brick, stone, and wood, including narrowwidth
siding, clapboards, wood shingles, or a reasonable equivalent. Metal, unfinished
concrete, and concrete block, as well as asphalt siding, are discouraged. Roofing
materials, where visible, should be cedar shake, slate, copper, or a reasonable
equivalent. Tarpaper, sheet metal, plastic, or fiberglass surfaces are strongly
discouraged.
B. Architectural details characteristic of the particular style and period proposed should
be incorporated into the design for new construction and should relate harmoniously
to adjacent buildings. Architectural details of a period need not be duplicated precisely,
but they should suggest the extent, nature, and scale of the period.
C. Large structures should have well-articulated façades to reduce the appearance of
significant bulk. Provision shall be made to coordinate site architecture with the
character of the district. Rooflines should be varied to provide architectural interest.
1109.4 Resort Commercial District Design Objectives
A. When feasible, cluster new commercial buildings and parking areas on the most
developable land within the district and retain significant contiguous land areas in a
natural or landscaped condition.
B. Assure that the design of new structures, parking, access ways and landscaping
is compatible with the natural features and topography of the area.
C. Limit and control access for new development from public roads so that traffic safety
is maintained and a sense of the rural landscape is retained and enhanced.
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 13
D. Discourage uncoordinated strip commercial development consisting of
small, individual, unrelated uses varying unpredictably in type, size, style, access
arrangements and environmental impact.
1110 OUTDOOR ILLUMINATION
1110.1 Purpose. The purpose of this §1110 is to encourage lighting practices and systems that
minimize the degradation of the night-time visual environment, thereby maintaining nighttime
safety and security while preventing glare, light trespass and light pollution.
1110.2 Exempt Light. The term outdoor lighting includes all exterior lighting systems except
those associated with the following:
A. airports;
B. emergency lighting, provided such lighting is temporary and is disconnected, or
otherwise ceases, immediately upon termination of the emergency condition;
C. fossil fuel lamps; and
D. temporary residential holiday lighting, provided it is illuminated for fewer than ninety
days per year.
1110.3 Lighting Design Requirements
A. All exterior lighting systems shall be designed, installed and maintained in such a
manner as to minimize or substantially reduce disability glare at any location on or off
the property; and to minimize or substantially reduce light trespass beyond the property
lot line, minimize sky illumination, and present an overall appearance that is
compatible with North Stoningtons rural character. All searchlights are prohibited
unless expressly allowed elsewhere in these Regulations. Photometric Plans shall be
required for all site plans that contain proposed lighting and shall include a description
of the proposed lighting fixtures and shall demonstrate that the maximum foot candle
does not exceed 3.0 at any property line.
B. Poles and standards used for outdoor lighting shall not exceed 20 feet in height (the
Commission encourages 12-foot to 15-foot light poles).
C. Lighting fixtures shall be full cut-off with low glare and directed lighting.
D. All non-essential lighting for security purposes shall be turned off after hours.
E. Area illuminators for parking lots, driveways, pedestrian walkways, and yards shall be
pole-mounted or building-mounted. Flood lighting shall be avoided except for loading
areas. Building-mounted floodlights may be installed where full cut-off luminaires are
impractical, provided top and side shields are attached and maintained to prevent light
emission above a vertical cut-off angle of forty-five degrees.
F. Fixtures shall be designed and mounted such that neither the light source nor the lens
are visible from above a height of five feet at the property lot line. Luminaires with sag
lens or drop lens shall be shielded.
G. Recessed low intensity up-lights, well lights, louvered lights, and cone lights may be
used for landscaping purposes only.
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 14
H. The Commission may approve a height greater than 20 feet for sports area luminaires
and other commercial, outdoor recreational uses provided the luminaires are designed,
located and directed to prevent glare and light trespass.

1112 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT (Revised 10/16/09)
1112.1 Purpose and Authority. Increased development without proper consideration of
stormwater impacts is a significant source of pollution to surface water and ground water.
These water resources are valuable natural, economic, recreational, cultural, and aesthetic
resources, and their protection and preservation is in the public interest and essential to the
health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the Town. Stormwater management systems
shall be designed to manage site runoff to minimize or eliminate surface and groundwater
pollution, prevent flooding, control peak discharges and provide pollutant renovation.
Design of a stormwater management system shall be in accordance with the Connecticut
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Connecticut Stormwater Quality
Manual (CSQM) and the Connecticut Department of Transportation Drainage Manual.
All applicants should meet with the Town Engineer prior to submitting the formal
application if possible.
1112.2 Applicability. A stormwater management plan is required for any development requiring
a Site Plan or for a subdivision/resubdivision that involves the disruption, clearing or
removal of ground cover or soil material, or the creation of impervious surfaces in an area
greater than one acre, or one-half acre if located in the Seasonal Use or Watershed
Protection Overlay Area. The stormwater management plan is to be designed to be
consistent with the CSQM as amended. The Commission shall use the standards and
criteria for decision outlined in the CSQM when reviewing the stormwater management
plan unless it finds, based on information submitted in connection with the application and
reviewed by the Town Engineer, that alternative standards or criteria should or may
reasonably be used and that such alternative standards and criteria will be equally or more
protective of the environment.
1112.3 Design Criteria
A. Sedimentation. The system shall remove 80% of the annual solid pollutant loading.
CSQM guidelines shall be used in such calculations except as specified in §1112.2.
B. Stormwater Flow. Individual watershed stormwater flows across the site boundary
(property line) must be equal to or less than the pre-existing conditions. In other words,
flows may not be increased within any watershed after development, unless the
applicant demonstrates, after review by the Town Engineer, that there would be no
resulting onsite or downstream negative effects. Flows shall be provided for the 2, 10,
25 and 100-year, 24- hour rainfall events. The plan must include pre-development and
post-development flow calculations for each sub-catchment drainage area.
C. Stormwater Volume. For each of the design rainfall events (above), the volume of
stormwater leaving the site shall be equal to the volume of stormwater leaving the site
in its pre-existing condition to the maximum extent practical, unless the applicant
demonstrates, after review by the Town Engineer, that there would be no resulting
onsite or downstream negative effects.
D. Groundwater Recharge Volume (GRV). The GRV shall be calculated and managed
in accordance with the procedures and recommendations of the CSQM except as
specified in §1112.2.
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 16
E. Water Quality Volume (WQV). The WQV shall be calculated and managed in
accordance with the procedures and recommendations of the CSQM except as
specified in §1112.2.
In granting the plan approval, the Commission may consider the recommendations of the
Town Engineer to make modifications or impose such conditions that may be deemed
necessary to ensure compliance with the CSQM or other applicable standards and criteria.
1112.4 Permitting. A Zoning Permit shall not be issued for any development requiring a Site
Plan or a Subdivision/Re-subdivision that involves the disruption, clearing or removal of
ground cover or soil material, or the creation of impervious surfaces in an area greater than
one acre, or one-half acre if located in the Seasonal Use Overlay or Water Supply
Protection Overlay Area, unless the Commission has approved a stormwater management
plan. Where appropriate, the Commission may require, as a prerequisite to the issuance of
a Zoning Permit:
A. recorded easements for the stormwater management facility and
easements to provide adequate access for inspection and maintenance from a public
right-of-way;
B. a recorded stormwater management maintenance agreement;
C. surety; and
D. easements from adjacent property owners as necessary.
1112.5 Suspension and Revocation. Any Zoning Permit may be suspended or revoked after
written notice is given to the permittee for any of the following reasons:
A. any violation(s) of the conditions of the stormwater management plan approval;
B. changes in site runoff characteristics upon which an approval was granted;
C. construction is not in accordance with the approved plan;
D. noncompliance with correction notice(s) or stop work order(s) issued for the
construction of the stormwater management facility; and/or
E. an immediate danger exists in a downstream area.
1112.6 Surety. A surety shall be required prior to the issuance of any Zoning Permit for the
construction of a stormwater management facility. The amount of the security shall not be
less than the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management facility. The
surety required in this section shall include provisions relative to forfeiture for failure to
complete work specified in the approved stormwater management plan and other
applicable laws and regulations, and any time limitations established in the stormwater
management plan. The surety shall not be fully released without a final inspection of the
completed work by a licensed engineer and the Zoning Enforcement Officer, submission
of as-built plans, and certification of completion by a licensed engineer and the Zoning
Enforcement Officer that the stormwater management facilities comply with the approved
plan and the provisions of these Regulations.
1112.7 Inspection
A. The Commission shall designate a professional engineer licensed in the State to
conduct inspections as may be necessary or appropriate. Written inspection reports
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 17
shall be made of the periodic inspections carried out during construction of stormwater
management systems to ensure compliance with the approved plan.
B. The developer shall notify the engineer responsible for inspections at least forty-eight
(48) hours before commencing any work in conjunction with the stormwater
management plan, and upon completion of the project to set up a final inspection.
C. Written inspection reports shall be provided to the developer and the Commission and
shall include:
1. the date and location of the inspection;
2. whether construction was in compliance with the approved stormwater
management plan;
3. any variations from the approved construction specifications; and
4. any violations that exist.
D. The owner and/or developer and, as necessary, the on-site personnel shall be notified
in writing when violations are observed. Written notification shall describe the nature
of the violation and the required corrective action.
E. The inspector shall provide the owner and/or developer and the Commission with the
inspection reports as soon as possible after completion of each required inspection.
Upon issuance of a Notice of Violation, or an unsatisfactory inspection report, all work
shall cease until corrective measures are taken and approved by a licensed engineer
and the ZEO.
1112.8 Maintenance and Inspection
A. Procedures
1. The applicant shall execute an inspection and maintenance agreement binding the
property owner and all subsequent owners. Such agreement shall provide for
access at reasonable times for regular inspections by the Commission, or its
authorized representative, to ensure that the stormwater facilities are maintained in
proper working condition to meet design standards.
2. The applicant and/or owner shall record the Agreement in the land records of the
Town.
3. The Agreement shall provide that, if after notice by the Commission to correct a
violation requiring maintenance work, satisfactory corrections are not made by the
owner(s) within 30 days, the Commission shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to perform all necessary work to place the facility in proper work
condition. The owner(s) of the facility shall be assessed the cost of the work and
any penalties. Charges shall become a special assessment against the property
(e.g., a lien). Nothing herein shall make or be construed to make the Commission,
the Town, and/or Town officials, employees, representatives, or agents, legally
liable or in any way responsible for the cost, inspection, maintenance, and/or
operation of approved stormwater management facilities.
B. Responsibility
1. The owner of the property, and any other person or agent in control of such
property, shall maintain in good condition, and promptly repair and restore, all
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 18
grade surfaces, walls, drains, dams and structures, vegetation, erosion and
sediment control measures, and other protective devices. Such repairs, or
restoration and maintenance shall be in accordance with the approved stormwater
management plan.
2. A maintenance and reporting schedule shall be developed for the life of any
stormwater management facility and shall state the maintenance to be completed,
the time period for completion, and who shall perform the maintenance. This
maintenance and reporting schedule shall be developed as part of the approved
stormwater management plan.
C. Terms and Conditions. The agreement shall also provide that the applicant/developer
and/or owner and each of their respective representatives, heirs, successors and assigns,
shall hold the Town of North Stonington and its officials, employees, representatives,
agents, boards, agencies and commissions and each of their respective representatives,
heirs, successors and assigns, harmless and indemnify them from and against any
claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) from any
personal injury (including death) and property damage resulting from any act or
omission of said applicant/developer and/or owner in the design, construction,
inspection, maintenance and operation of stormwater management facilities approved
pursuant to this section of these Regulations, and from any acts or omissions, including
without limitation, negligent acts or omissions of said Town, and/or its officials,
employees, representatives, agents, boards, agencies and commissions and each of
their respective representatives, heirs, successors and assigns in the approval and
inspection of said facilities or the performance of any activities pursuant to
§1112.8.A.3 of these Regulations.
D. Any agreement shall apply to the owners and/or lessees of the property in question and
shall run with the land.
1113 CONSOLIDATED PARCELS
1113.1 Purpose and Applicability
A. This §1113 encourages the consolidated development of parcels located in the nonresidential
zoning districts to preserve the capacity and safety of existing arterial
roadways; to provide flexibility in meeting bulk requirements; to facilitate integrated
development of large areas of land; to reduce parking requirements through shared
parking; and, to facilitate consolidation of stormwater management systems among
smaller parcels.
B. Any number of contiguous parcels may be consolidated for the purposes of
development regardless of ownership, and the consolidated parcel shall be considered
to be one lot for the purposes of meeting the requirements of these Regulations.
C. Consolidated parcels shall be permitted only in the C, HC, ED, RC and I Zoning
Districts.
1113.2 Basic Requirements. The consolidated parcel must be developed with an integrated plan
for access, buildings, parking, loading, landscaping, and signage. Applicants for
consolidated parcels shall be required to:
A. provide for shared access to abutting properties through common driveways, parking
lots, service roads and/or cross-easements (whether existing or future);
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 19
B. construct all or a portion of a shared driveway or service road in order to provide for
shared access, where appropriate; and
C. file easements on the land records, acceptable to the Commission and Town Attorney,
in favor of the abutting properties and/or the Town to allow for their future
interconnection.
1113.3 Additional Requirements
A. Unless the Commission determines that buffers are needed between incompatible uses
within a consolidated parcel, the yard, buffer, parking, and building setback
requirements shall not apply to individual lots within a consolidated parcel, but shall
instead apply to the consolidated parcel as a whole.
B. The Commission may limit direct highway access to individual parcels within a
consolidated parcel in accordance with the access management requirements of
§1105.1.
Chapter 11  Site Design Requirements
11 - 20
Chapter 12  Permits by Staff
12 - 1
The following requirements/procedures pertain to all uses and activities that do not require a Site
Plan or Special Permit, and therefore may be approved by staff.
1201 Zoning Permits
A. Applicability. No building and/or portion of a building shall be constructed, reconstructed,
altered, excavated for, moved or structurally altered in whole or in part for any purpose, nor
shall any use be established or changed in the Town of North Stonington, without a Zoning
Permit from the Zoning Enforcement Officer or the Commission, issued in conformance with:
1. the provisions of these Regulations; or
2. an approval granted by the Commission; or
3. a variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals; or
4. Any combination of the above.
B. A Zoning Permit may not be issued for buildings or structures or for uses of land, buildings, or
structures not clearly permitted by these Regulations in the various districts.
C. A Zoning Permit is not required for repairs or alterations to existing buildings or structures,
provided that such work does not increase the floor area of any building or structure and does
not change the use thereof.
D. Contents of Application. All applications shall set forth such information as may be required
in order to allow the ZEO or the Commission to determine the conformance of any proposed
buildings, structures or uses, or any proposed changes thereto, with these Regulations. The
ZEO or Commission may require submission of additional information, including any
information that might be required for a Site Plan (e.g., soils data, topography, drainage
computations, etc.), and a plot plan prepared, signed, and sealed by a licensed land surveyor,
to insure compliance with these Regulations. The ZEO or the Commission may further require
that location markers for the building foundation be set by a Connecticut licensed land surveyor
in accordance with the plot plan prior to the issuance of a Zoning Permit. For new dwellings
and for commercial/business and industrial construction, the ZEO or Commission may require
the submission of a survey with Class A-2 level of accuracy in order to determine zoning
compliance and shall require that such plans be prepared by a Connecticut licensed engineer
and/or land surveyor.

conditions of approval are not adhered to strictly, the Commission may declare such
Zoning Permit null and void, provided no such decision may be made until after the
Commission has provided the permit-holder an opportunity for a hearing.
Chapter 12  Permits by Staff
12 - 2
F. Expiration of Zoning Permits. Zoning Permits issued by the ZEO for construction, erection
or alteration of a building or structure are valid until a Certification of Zoning Compliance is
issued, or until applicable time limits described herein expire. A Zoning Permit issued by the
ZEO that is not associated with any other Commission approved site work (e.g., Site Plan,
Special Permit) shall expire after one year if no work has commenced or if the site work has
ceased for a period of one year. The ZEO may grant one extension of one additional year to
allow the applicant to commence or continue approved work.
G. Building Permits. No Building Permit shall be issued by the Building Official for a building,
use or structure subject to these Regulations without certification in writing from the ZEO that
such building, use or structure is in conformity with these Regulations or is a valid nonconforming
use under these Regulations. A Zoning Permit shall constitute the required
certification of zoning compliance for purposes of issuing a Building Permit.
1202 Post Development Certifications of Zoning Compliance
A. Applicability. It shall be unlawful for any newly erected building or any structural addition
and/or use for which a Zoning Permit has been issued to be occupied or used, or for any
building, lot, or premises or part thereof to be converted or changed from one type of use or
occupancy to another, until a post-development Certification of Zoning Compliance has been
issued by the ZEO (see also §1203, Change of Use). The ZEO may require an as-built Site
Plan to facilitate this review. In the absence of the ZEO, the Chairman or other designated
agent of the Commission may issue a Certification of Zoning Compliance. A Certification of
Compliance shall remain valid only so long as the building, structure, lot, or use thereof or the
use of the land remains in full conformity with these Regulations or any relevant amendments
thereto. The Certification of Zoning Compliance shall be issued within thirty business days
after a written request is made to the ZEO, provided that:
1. any building, structure or alteration and/or use of property for which the Certification is
sought has been properly completed and is fully in compliance with these Regulations and
that all pertinent conditions of any Zoning Permit or approval for such building, structure
or use have been fulfilled; and
2. that the Health Officer or Sanitarian (Deputy Health Officer) or responsible regulatory
agency (regional/state/federal) has inspected the premises and has given written approval
of the installation of the sewage disposal facility and water supply system.
B. Application Procedures
1. A request for a Certification of Zoning Compliance shall be accompanied by plans and/or
other information that demonstrate compliance with applicable regulations and approvals.
2. Within 15 days of such application, the ZEO or other authorized official shall inspect the
premises.
3. If all requirements of these Regulations are met, including requirements of approved site
and plot plans, the Certification shall be issued within 15 days; otherwise, the Certification
shall be denied for stated reasons.
4. In the event that any permit or certificate is issued based on incorrect information or the
specific conditions of approval are not adhered to strictly, the Commission may declare
such permit or certification null and void, provided no such decision may be made until
Chapter 12  Permits by Staff
12 - 3
after the Commission has provided the permit- or certificate-holder an opportunity for a
hearing.
5. A Certification of Zoning Compliance shall remain in effect as long as the specified uses
and conditional requirements are properly maintained but shall cease whenever such
conditions and uses are terminated or no longer maintained.
C. Notice Provisions
1. In accordance with CGS §8-3(f), the recipient of a Zoning Permit or Certification of Zoning
Compliance may publish notice of issuance of the Zoning Permit or Certification in order
to establish the appeal period per CGS §8-7.
2. Any such notice to be published by the recipient shall contain:
a. a description of the building, use or structure and its location;
b. the identity of the applicant; and
c. a statement that an aggrieved person may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals in
accordance with the provisions of CGS §8-7.
D. Certificate of Occupancy. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued by the Building
Official for a building, use or structure subject to these Regulations without certification in
writing from the ZEO that such building, use or structure is in conformity with these
Regulations or is a valid non-conforming use under these Regulations
1203 Change of Non-Residential Use of Buildings and Properties
A. When any change of ownership occurs to an existing non-residential use, a Change of User
form must be submitted to update the Land Use file for the property.
B. Any proposed change to a permitted non-residential use that does not involve any enlargement
or modification to, or reconfiguration of, existing building/structure footprint, parking (lot size
or number of spaces), access drives, or overall site lay-out, shall require completion of a Change
of Use Application and subsequent review and approval by the ZEO.
C. Any proposed change in use of a non-residential use that involves any enlargement or
modification to, or reconfiguration of existing buildings/structures, parking (lot size or number
of spaces), access drives, or overall site lay-out, shall require completion of a Change of Use
Application and review by the Commission. If the Commission finds that the proposed change
of use and any related modification to existing buildings/structures and/or site lay-out would
not be considered significant, it may, at its discretion, direct the ZEO to issue a Zoning Permit.
D. All other proposed changes shall be deemed to require Site Plan or Special Permit review and
approval by the Commission per these Regulations (See Chapter 13).
E. All changes to uses existing at the time of adoption of these regulations that require a Site Plan
or Special Permit will require upgrading of signs, landscaping, lighting, access ways, common
design elements and other standards of the district to the extent possible.
1204 Property Line Adjustment/ Lot Division (Free Split)
Any and all property line adjustments or lot divisions (splits) within the Town of North Stonington
shall require a review by the ZEO to determine compliance with the Zoning and Subdivision
Regulations.
Chapter 12  Permits by Staff
12 - 4
A. A property line adjustment is any change in the location of an existing property line that does
not create an additional lot, does not result in a lot or condition that violates the Zoning
Regulations, and does not increase any existing lot nonconformities with respect to the
dimensional requirements of the Zoning Regulations. Such property line adjustment shall not
be considered a subdivision or resubdivision so long as it does not create a lot or affect a street
layout shown on an approved subdivision or resubdivision map, and does not affect any area
reserved for public use or established as open space on an approved subdivision plan.
B. A Free Split is a one-time division of land permitted on a parcel that has remained undivided,
and in the same configuration as it was on or before 10/18/1963. Any subsequent division of
land requires subdivision approval.
C. The ZEO may require one or more of the following if he/she deems it necessary to determine
whether a proposed property line adjustment or lot division is consistent with these
Regulations:
1. deeds;
2. a certified title search;
3. a property history map; and/or
4. a survey with Class A-2 level of accuracy.
D. The applicant shall record the approved survey in the office of the Town Clerk of North
Stonington, and any survey not so recorded within ninety (90) days following its approval, shall
become null and void. The applicant may request two (2) additional ninety (90) day extensions.
The request for an extension must come before the expiration for the initial time period. A signed
copy of the approved survey shall be provided by the applicant to the Zoning Enforcement Officer
and to the office of the Town Assessor.
1205 Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (SE&SC)
A soil erosion and sediment control plan shall be submitted pursuant to §1111 of these Regulations
with any application for development, or before the commencement or continuance of any activity,
in which the disturbed area of such development or activity is or would be cumulatively more than
one-half acre (21,780 sq. ft.) For purposes of this section, the term disturbed area shall mean an
area on which the ground cover is removed or destroyed, leaving the land subject to accelerated
erosion. A soil erosion and sediment control plan may be required for the construction or alteration
of a single-family dwelling that is not part of a subdivision of land as determined by the ZEO. The
ZEO may issue an order to correct or remediate any conditions that are found to be causing, or
likely to cause, unreasonable erosion or sedimentation.
1206 Land Disturbance Permit
As set forth in §1006.2.D, and subject to the exemptions in §1006.2.E, of these Regulations, a Land
Disturbance Permit may be required prior to any disturbance of land not related to an active Zoning
Permit or Building Permit or as part of an approved subdivision plan in order to determine the
location and size of the area to be disturbed, the nature of the activity, and the need for additional
review or approval (such as an excavation permit, or an SE&SC Plan).
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 1
The following requirements/procedures pertain to all uses and activities that require a Site Plan or
Special Permit, and therefore review and approval by the Commission. All applications for Site Plan
approval must show conformance with Chapter 11 (Site Design Requirements).
1301 PRELIMINARY CONCEPT PLAN
A. Applicability. If an application is of such size or nature that providing a Site Plan or other
application may be a significant expense, the applicant may submit a Concept Plan for informal
presentation to the Commission.
B. Concept Plan Review
1. A Concept Plan shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Office and shall be
accompanied by plans and sufficient information so that the Commission may informally
review the plan for general conformance with these Regulations.
3. A Concept Plan shall be considered only informational and advisory in nature and no
development rights shall attach to the review or consideration of any Concept Plan. The
Commission shall make no decision on the plan, and its review shall not be binding on the
applicant or the Commission.
4. A Concept Plan shall be placed on file in the Commissions office for continuing reference
purposes for any subsequent application.
1302 SITE PLAN APPLICATION
1302.1 Applicability
A. Except as may be expressly provided elsewhere in these Regulations, a Site Plan
application shall be submitted:
1. for any proposed new use designated in the Regulations as requiring Site Plan or
Special Permit approval. In the event that a proposed Site Plan is being submitted
in connection with a Special Permit application, the Commissions review of the
Site Plan application shall be deemed to be an integral component of the Special
Permit review;
2. in a Residential zone, for any construction, development, expansion, or major
alteration of any non-residential use; and/or
3. for any expansion or other alteration of any existing use designated in the
Regulations as requiring Site Plan or Special Permit approval if such change would
affect the layout of any structure, facility, parking or loading area, or other physical
feature shown on a previously approved Site Plan or, if no previous Site Plan was
approved for such use, if such physical feature(s) would have been required to be
shown on a Site Plan for a new use under any other provision of these Regulations.
As used in this §1302, the term expansion includes, but is not limited to, any
change that does or is likely to increase the number of parking spaces required by
§1104 of these Regulations.
B. A new or revised Site Plan shall not be required for:
1. interior remodeling work;
2. changes in exterior mechanical equipment, dumpsters or storage structures that
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 2
occupy less than 200 square feet of floor area; or
3. changes in the location of existing fences, or new fence locations.

1302.3 Proceedings
A. An incomplete Site Plan application may be denied in accordance with §§1306.C.
B. If a Site Plan application involves an activity regulated pursuant to CGS §22a-36 to
§22a-45, inclusive, the applicant shall submit an application for a permit to the Inland
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 3
Wetlands Commission not later than the day such application is filed with the Planning
and Zoning Commission.
C. If the Commission finds that any proposed new construction or other activity is
significant, the Commission:
1. may hold a public hearing on the application; and
2. if such hearing is to be held, shall require that the applicant give notice to property
owners in accordance with the requirements of §§1306.G of these Regulations.
D. Notification to adjoining municipalities may be required in accordance with the
requirements of §§1306.H.
E. Whenever a Site Plan application is required in conjunction with another application
requiring a public hearing by the Commission (such as a Special Permit application or
a Zone Change application), the time period for acting on the Site Plan application
shall coincide with the time period for acting on the related application.
F. Whenever approval of a Site Plan is the only approval required, a decision on the
application shall be rendered within 65 days after the date of receipt of such Site Plan
application, regardless of whether the Commission holds a public hearing on the
application, except that the applicant may consent to one or more extensions of such
period, provided the total period of any such extension or extensions shall not exceed
an additional 65 days.
G. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if an application involves an activity
regulated pursuant to CGS §22a-36 to § 22a-45, inclusive and the time for a decision
by the Commission would elapse prior to the 35th day after a decision by the Inland
Wetlands Commission (IWC), the time period for a decision shall be extended to 35
days after the decision of the IWC.
H. Approval of a site plan shall be presumed unless a decision to deny or modify it is
rendered within the applicable time period specified above (approval as a result of
failure of the Commission to act).
I. The applicant may, at any time prior to action by the Commission, withdraw such
application.
1302.4 Considerations
A. On a Site Plan application involving an activity regulated pursuant to CGS §22a-36 to
§ 22a-45, inclusive, the Commission shall:
1. wait to render its decision until the Inland Wetlands Commission has submitted a
report with its final decision; and
2. give due consideration to any report of the Inland Wetlands Commission when
making its decision.
B. On a Site Plan application involving notice to adjoining municipalities, the
Commission shall give due consideration to any report or testimony received from such
municipalities.
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 4
C. No Site Plan application shall be approved unless it is materially in conformance with
all applicable provisions of these Regulations, including, but not limited to, the Site
Design Requirements in Chapter 11.
D. The Commission may modify and approve any proposed Site Plan if it determines such
modifications are needed to satisfy the applicable requirements of these Regulations.
E. The Commission may, as a condition of approval of a site plan or modified site plan,
require a financial guarantee in the form of a bond, a bond with surety or similar
instrument to ensure (A) the timely and adequate completion of any site improvements
that will be conveyed to or controlled by the municipality, and (B) the implementation
of any erosion and sediment controls required during construction activities. The
amount of such financial guarantee shall be calculated so as not to exceed the
anticipated actual costs for the completion of such site improvements or the
implementation of such erosion and sediment controls plus a contingency amount not
to exceed ten per cent of such costs.
F. The Commission shall not approve any Site Plan for any property on which there exists
a zoning violation, unless the implementation of such Site Plan would remedy such
violation.
G. The submission of any application for Site Plan approval shall be deemed to represent
a certification by the applicant and property owner that the proposed use will comply
with the performance standards of §1102.3 of these Regulations, and an
acknowledgment that any approval of the Site Plan by the Commission will be made
in reliance on that certification. If the use, as actually established and operating, fails
to meet those performance standards, the Commissions approval of the Site Plan shall
not prevent the issuance of a zoning enforcement order to remediate such
noncompliance, even if such order may require a revision of the approved Site Plan.
1302.5 Action Documentation
A. Whenever it modifies or denies a Site Plan application, the Commission shall state
upon its record the reason(s) for its decision.
B. The Commission shall send, by certified mail, a copy of any decision to the applicant
within 15 days after such decision is rendered.
C. The Commission shall cause notice of the approval or denial of Site Plans to be
published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in North Stonington within
15 days after such decision is rendered.
D. In any case in which such notice is not published within the 15-day period after a
decision has been rendered, the person who submitted such plan may provide for the
publication of such notice within ten days thereafter.
E. On any application for which the period for approval has expired and on which no
action has been taken, the Commission shall send a letter of approval to the applicant
within 15 days of the date on which the period for approval expired and such letter of
approval shall state the date on which the five-year completion period expires.
1302.6 Following Approval
A. Following approval of a Site Plan application, one fixed-line mylar copy and three
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 5
paper copies of the approved plan(s) shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning
Office:
1. bearing the raised seal and signature of the appropriate professionals who prepared
the drawing(s);
2. bearing a copy of the decision letter of the Commission and any other Town
regulatory agencies authorizing the activity; and
3. containing a signature block where the Chairman of the Commission can indicate
the approval of the Commission.
B. Following signature by the Chairman, the applicant shall record the Site Plan in the office of
the Town Clerk of North Stonington, and any plan not so recorded within ninety (90) days
following its approval, or within ninety (90) days of the date upon which said plan is taken as
approved by reason of the failure of the Commission to act, shall become null and void. The
applicant may request two (2) additional ninety (90) day extensions. The request for an extension
must come before the expiration for the initial time period. A signed copy of the approved plan
shall be provided by the applicant to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and to the office of the
Town Assessor.
1302.7 Expiration and Completion
A. Any Site Plan approval under which the construction of any proposed building has not
been commenced within 12 months from the date of such approval, shall expire unless
the Commission, upon a showing of good cause for the delay, allows a longer time
period, not to exceed 24 months from the date of approval. For the purposes of this
section, the construction of a building will be deemed to have commenced when
foundation or exterior walls have begun to be emplaced or built.
B. Except as may be provided by state law, all work in connection with a Site Plan shall
be completed within five years after the date of approval of the plan. Failure to
complete all work within such five-year or other required period shall result in
automatic expiration of the approval of such Site Plan unless the Commission, upon a
showing of good cause for the delay, grants an extension of the time to complete work
in connection with such Site Plan.
C. The Commission may grant one or more extensions of the time to complete all or part
of the work in connection with the Site Plan, provided the total extension or extensions
shall not exceed ten years from the date of approval of such Site Plan, unless otherwise
provided or allowed by state law.
D. The Commission may condition the approval of such extension on a determination of
the adequacy of any bond or other surety.
1303 SPECIAL PERMIT APPLICATION
1303.1 Applicability
A. A Special Permit application shall be submitted for any activity designated in the
Regulations as requiring Special Permit approval.
B. Notwithstanding the above, a Special Permit application shall not be required for any
modifications to a previously approved Special Permit use if such modifications would
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 6
not change the essential character of the use and would not require the submission of
a new or modified Site Plan pursuant to §1302.1 of these Regulations.
1303.2 Submission Requirements
A. A Special Permit application (original & fifteen (15) copies) shall be submitted to the
Planning and Zoning Office and shall include a completed application form and the
appropriate fee.
B. Each application for a Special Permit shall be accompanied by a Site Plan application.
If the applicant believes that the proposed use will not require any changes in a
previously approved Site Plan, he or she may submit a copy of the previously approved
Site Plan and need not submit any of the additional information or materials noted in
the Site Plan Check Sheet found in Appendix D of these Regulations, except as may
be needed for the Commission to evaluate the Special Permit criteria. However, the
Commission may require the submission of additional materials or information from
the Site Plan Check Sheet if it finds that the application materials are inadequate to
evaluate the application or if the proposed Special Permit uses may require
modifications to the previously approved Site Plan.
C. The Commission may require the submission of any additional information it may
deem necessary to determine compliance with any applicable provisions of these
Regulations.
1303.3 Proceedings
A. An incomplete Special Permit application may be denied in accordance with §1306.C.

Inland Wetlands Commission not later than the day such application is filed with the
Planning and Zoning Commission.

1. publish a legal notice in accordance with the requirements of §1306.F of these
Regulations, and
2. require that the applicant give notice to property owners in accordance with the
requirements of §1306.G of these Regulations.

E. The Commission shall process the Special Permit application and any accompanying
Site Plan application within the period of time specified in §1306.D.
F. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if an application involves an activity
regulated pursuant to CGS §22a-36 to §22a-45, inclusive and the time for a decision
by the Commission would elapse prior to the 35th day after a decision by the Inland
Wetlands Commission (IWC), the time period for a decision shall be extended to 35
days after the decision of the IWC.
G. The applicant may, at any time prior to action by the Commission, withdraw such
application.
1303.4 Special Permit Criteria. In considering an application for a Special Permit, the
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 7
Commission shall evaluate the merits of the application with respect to all of the following
criteria that the Commission may determine are relevant to the application. To the extent
the Commission finds such criteria applicable, the applicant shall have the burden to prove:
A. that the application is materially in conformance with all applicable provisions of these
Regulations, including, but not limited to, the Site Design Requirements in Chapter 11,
and that the standards for approval of any accompanying Site Plan application have
been met;
B. that transportation services would be adequate and that the uses would not cause traffic
congestion or undue traffic generation that would have a deleterious effect on the
welfare or the safety of the motoring public;
C. that the proposed uses and structures would be in harmony with the appropriate and
orderly development of the Zoning District in which they are proposed to be situated,
and that the use(s) would not be noxious, offensive, or detrimental to the area by reason
of odors, fumes, dust, noise, vibrations, appearance, or other similar reasons;
D. that no adverse effect would result to the character of the district, property values, or
historic features of the immediate neighborhood;
E. that the character of the immediate neighborhood would be preserved in terms of scale,
density, intensity of use and architectural design;
F. In accordance with CGS §22a-19, that the proposed uses would not cause any
unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of the air, water and other natural
resources of the state; and
G. that all proposed uses and structures would be consistent with future development as
identified and envisioned in these Regulations and the North Stonington Plan of
Conservation and Development.
1303.5 Decision Considerations
A. Before the Commission may approve a Special Permit application, it must determine
that the application satisfies:
1. the Special Permit criteria in §1303.4 of these Regulations; and
2. all other applicable provisions of these Regulations.
B. On a Special Permit application involving an activity regulated pursuant to CGS §22a-
36 to §22a-45, inclusive, the Commission shall:
1. wait to render its decision until the Inland Wetlands Commission has submitted a
report with its final decision; and
2. give due consideration to any report of the Inland Wetlands Commission when
making its decision.
C. On a Special Permit application involving notice to adjoining municipalities under
§1306.H, the Commission shall give due consideration to any report or testimony
received from such municipalities.
D. The Commission may approve an application for a Special Permit, deny the
application, or approve the application subject to such conditions as it may deem
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 8
necessary to protect the public health, safety, welfare, property values, and natural
resources of the state. The Commission may also require that some or all conditions of
approval be met prior to the issuance of the Zoning Permit by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer.
E. The approval of any Special Permit for any property on which there exists a zoning
violation shall be deemed conditioned, whether expressly specified in the decision or
not, upon the remediation of such violation, and no Zoning Permit or Certification of
Zoning Compliance may be issued for such Special Permit uses until any such violation
has been remediated.
F. The submission of any application for Special Permit approval shall be deemed to
represent a certification by the applicant and property owner that the proposed use will
comply with the performance standards of §1102.3 of these Regulations, and an
acknowledgment that any approval of the Special Permit by the Commission will be
made in reliance on that certification and that such approval is conditioned on
continuing conformance with those standards, whether or not such condition is
expressly stated on the record. If the use, as actually established and operating, fails to
meet those performance standards, the Commissions approval of the Special Permit
shall not prevent the issuance of a zoning enforcement order to remediate such
noncompliance, even if such order may require a revision of the approved Special
Permit.
1303.6 Action Documentation
A. Whenever it acts on a Special Permit application, the Commission shall state upon its
record the reason(s) for its decision.

1. state the name of the owner of record;
2. contain a description of the premises to which it relates;
3. identify the section and/or § of the Regulations under which the Special Permit
was granted or denied; and
4. specify the nature of the Special Permit.
C. The Commission shall send, by certified mail, a copy of any decision on a Special
Permit application to the applicant within 15 days after such decision is rendered.

of the Special Permit application to be published in a newspaper having a substantial
circulation in North Stonington within 15 days after such decision is rendered.

decision has been rendered, the person who submitted such application may provide
for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter.
1303.7 Following Approval
A. Within ninety (90) days after the Commissions approval of a Special Permit and Site
Plan, the applicant shall submit to the Land Use Office two (2) sets of final plans, one
on mylar and one (1) on paper. Such plans shall be identical to those approved by the
Chapter 13  Permits by Commission
13 - 9
Commission, except that they shall incorporate any conditions or modifications
required in the Commissions approval. Such plans shall be signed and sealed by the
surveyor, engineer or other professional who has participated in the preparation of such
plans.
If such plans are found to be in accordance with the final approval, the Chairman of
the Commission shall endorse such plans. The endorsed mylar plans shall be filed by
the applicant in the land records no later than ninety (90) days after the approval by the
Commission, except that the Commission may act to extend this filing period for an
additional ninety (90) day period upon the request of the applicant.
A Special Permit granted by the Commission shall become effective only upon the
filing of a copy of the Special Permit, certified by the Commission, in the land records
of the Town, in accordance with the provisions of CGS §8-3d.
B. A Special Permit shall authorize only the particular use or uses specified in the
Commissions approval.
C. Failure to strictly adhere to the documents, plans, terms, conditions and/or safeguards
approved by the Commission shall be a violation of these Regulations and the
Commission shall have the authority to revoke the Special Permit at any time the
operation is found to be in noncompliance with the original permit, provided, however,
that no such revocation shall be ordered unless the Commission or its agent provides
written notice of the violations to the current landowner and the Commission provides
the landowner with an opportunity for a hearing on the violations.
D. A Special Permit may be amended or modified in like manner as provided above for
the granting of a Special Permit, except that amendments the Commission finds to be
of a minor nature, that result in no significant change in the use or its intensity, and that
do not materially alter the Special Permit, may be authorized with Commission
approval only, without another public hearing.

1401 FLOODPLAIN VARIANCES

rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or any locally-adopted historic district
without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section and provided
the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not result in the structure
losing its historical designation.
B. Functionally Dependent Use or Facility. Variances may be issued for new
construction and substantial improvements and other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use or facility provided the structure or other
Chapter 14  Zoning Board of Appeals
14 - 2
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage, creates no
additional threat to public safety and meet all the requirements of subpart C below.
C. Floodway Prohibition. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway
if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
1401.2 Considerations for Granting Floodplain Variances: In passing upon such applications,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
all standards specified in other sections of this regulation and the items listed below. Upon
consideration of these factors and the purposes of this regulation, the Zoning Board of
Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this regulation.
A. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others.
B. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
C. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the
effect of such damage on the individual owner.
D. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
E. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally
dependent facility.
F. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for
the proposed use.
G. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
H. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain
management program for that area.
I. The safety access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
J. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
K. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
1401.3 Conditions for Floodplain Variances
A. Variances shall only be used upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a
historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not
to destroy the historic character and design of the building and result in the loss of
historic designation of the building. Variances pertain to a piece of property and are
not personal in nature. A properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property
with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the regulation would
create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners.
Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. For example, economic or financial hardship is not sufficient cause for a
variance, nor are inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal
Chapter 14  Zoning Board of Appeals
14 - 3
preferences or disapproval of ones neighbors.
B. Variances shall only be used upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a
determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship,
and; (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisance, damage the rights or property values of other persons in the area, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, ordinances or
regulations. Only hardships that are based on unusual or unique physical
characteristics of the property in question, characteristics that are not shared by
adjacent parcels, shall quality to meet subsection (ii) above. Claims of hardship based
on the structure, on economic gain or loss, or on personal or self-created circumstances
are not sufficient cause for the granting of a variance.
C. No variance may be issued within a regulatory floodway that will result in any increase
in the 100-year flood levels. A variance may be issued for new construction,
substantial improvements and other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that there is good and sufficient cause for
providing relief; and the variance does not cause a rise in the 100-year flood level
within a regulatory floodway. The structure and other development must be protected
by methods that minimize flood damages.
D. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base
flood elevation (BFE), and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with
the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as
$25 for $100 of insurance coverage.

APPLICATION PROCESS
Section 4  Application Process Page- 7
4.1 PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION
The Commission recommends that subdivision applicants come to a Commission meeting for a preliminary discussion prior to submitting a formal application. Persons wishing to do so should notify the Commission seven (7) days prior to the meeting date. A preliminary discussion is not a substitute for a formal application, and neither an applicant nor the Commission is bound by the comments made during a preliminary discussion. The Commission can only make binding decisions after a formal application is submitted.
4.1.1 Optional Sketch Plan
A. Purpose. The Pre-application Sketch Plan is a general layout of a proposed subdivision submitted by the future subdivider for informal consideration by the Commission, prior to a formal submission of an application for approval. A Pre-application Sketch Plan shall not be required prior to submission of an application, but applicants are encouraged to use it as a means of ensuring that basic requirements can be met prior to incurring engineering, application, and legal fees involved with submission of the required application and plan. It should be clearly understood that the Pre-application Sketch Plan enjoys no official legal status and that consent with regard to feasibility of the Pre-application Sketch Plan on the part of the Commission in no way predicates approval of the required plan. A Pre-application Sketch Plan is encouraged in the interest of improved communication between the applicant and the Commission with regard to intent and general design, but it is at the sole discretion of the applicant.
B. Contents. The Pre-application Sketch Plan may be drawn on tracing paper with pencil at a suitable scale, which will show sufficient information about the subdivision to present a clear picture of its scope and impact. To be effective, the Pre-application Sketch Plan should show:
1. the subdivision name, boundaries, true north point, date, and scale;
2. the names and address of the record owner and the applicant;
3. approximate locations of all major site features such as existing streams, water bodies, stonewalls, large trees, rock ridges, outcroppings, and regulated soil;
4. the names and approximate location of existing adjacent roads and proposed roads;
5. the total site area, the total number of proposed lots, the general configuration of the proposed lot boundary lines, and approximate area of each proposed lot;
6. areas dedicated or reserved for purposes other than residential use; and
7. subsurface soil conditions based on results of random soil pit tests distributed evenly over the proposed subdivision tract.
4.2 FORMAL APPLICATION SUBMISSION
Any person intending to subdivide land in the Town of North Stonington shall submit an application as prescribed herein to the Commission. Fifteen (15) copies of the plan shall be submitted, plus a copy of the list of property owners within one hundred (100) feet of the parcel being subdivided, including the names of all property owners, street address per the Assessors

is essential to the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the Town. It is therefore, the purpose of this section to protect and preserve the resources within the Town of North Stonington by managing storm water flows in accordance with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual (CSQM), as amended. The provisions of these Regulations are pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes 8-25 inclusive and 8-2(b) and shall apply to all development occurring within the Town. The provisions of this section of the Regulations shall be the minimum requirements for stormwater management plans in the Town of North Stonington, and enactment of this Regulation shall not preclude the application of applicable town, state and/or federal regulations to the facilities regulated thereby.
5.7.2 Applicability. A Stormwater Management Plan is required for any development requiring a Site Plan or for a Subdivision/Re-subdivision that disturbs over one (1) acre of land over the total project area. The stormwater management plan is to be designed to be consistent with the CSQM (as amended). The Commission shall use the standards and criteria for decision outlined in the CSQM (as amended) when reviewing the Stormwater Management Plan.
5.7.3 Design Criteria
A. Sedimentation. The system shall remove eighty (80) percent of the annual solid pollutant loading. This can be met by providing manufacturers data sheets, or calculations verifying the adequacy of a site designed system. CSQM guidelines may be used in such calculations, or the Engineer may use other methodologies with prior approval of the Town Engineer.
B. Stormwater Flow. Provide individual watershed stormwater flows across the site boundary (property line) equal to or less than the pre-existing condition. In other words, flows may not be increased within any watershed after development. This shall be provided for the 2, 10, 25 and 100-year rainfall events.
C. Stormwater Volume. For each of the design rainfall events (above), the volume of stormwater leaving the site shall be equal to or less than the volume of stormwater leaving the site in its pre-existing condition.
In granting the plan approval, the Commission may make modifications or impose such conditions that may be deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the CSQM (as amended).
5.7.4 Review Fee. A non-refundable review fee shall be collected per the Town Ordinance Concerning Fees for Review and Evaluation of Land Use Applications and Inspection of Land Use Permit Compliance; at the time the stormwater management plan is submitted.
5.7.5 Permitting. A Zoning Permit shall not be issued for any-development requiring a Site Plan or a Subdivision/Re-subdivision that disturbs over one (1) acre of land unless the Commission has approved a Stormwater Management Plan. Where appropriate, a Zoning Permit shall not be issued without the following, as appropriate:
A. recorded easements for the stormwater management facility and easements to provide adequate access for inspection and maintenance from a public right-of-way;
SUBDIVISION PLAN REQUIREMENTS
SECTION

Page - 22 Section 5  Subdivision Plan Requirements
B. a recorded stormwater management maintenance agreement, per Section 5.7.9 (A) of these Regulations;
C. surety; and
D. easements from adjacent property owners as necessary.
5.7.6 Suspension and Revocation. Any Zoning Permit may be suspended or revoked after written notice is given to the permittee for any of the following reasons:
A. any violation(s) of the conditions of the Stormwater Management Plan approval;
B. changes in site runoff characteristics upon which an approval was granted;
C. construction is not in accordance with the approved plan;
D. noncompliance with correction notice(s) or stop work order(s) issued for the construction of the stormwater management facility; and/or
E. an immediate danger exists in a downstream area in the opinion of the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
5.7.7 Surety. A surety shall be required prior to the issuance of any zoning and/or grading permit for the construction of a stormwater management facility. The amount of the security shall not be less than the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management facility. The surety required in this section shall include provisions relative to forfeiture for failure to complete work specified in the approved Stormwater Management Plan, and other applicable laws and regulations, and any time limitations established in the Stormwater Management Plan. The surety shall not be fully released without a final inspection of the completed work by a licensed Engineer and the Zoning Enforcement Officer, submission of as-built plans, and certification of completion by a licensed Engineer and the Zoning Enforcement Officer that the stormwater management facilities comply with the approved plan and the provisions of these Regulations.
5.7.8 Inspection
A. The developer shall retain a professional engineer licensed in the State to conduct inspections. Written inspection reports shall be made of the periodic inspections necessary during construction of stormwater management systems to ensure compliance with the approved plan.
B. The developer shall notify the engineer responsible for inspections as least forty-eight (48) hours before commencing any work in conjunction with the Stormwater Management Plan and upon completion of the project when a final inspection will be conducted.
C. Written inspection reports shall be provided to the developer and the Commission and shall include:
1. the date and location of the inspection;
2. whether construction was in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan;
3. any variations from the approved construction specifications; and

6.1 LOTS
Proposed lots shall be arranged to make the best use of the natural terrain, to preserve important natural features, and to afford maximum opportunity for the use of solar energy.
6.1.1 Lots shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Regulations for the Town of North Stonington, Connecticut, as amended.
6.1.2 Where practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the road on which the lots front, or radial to curved road lines.
6.1.3 To the maximum extent possible, lots shall be generally rectangular in shape. Excessively deep or irregularly shaped lots shall be avoided.
6.1.4 Lots should be arranged in a manner that provides the best opportunity for the use of solar energy in buildings subsequently constructed on the lots. As a general rule, lot arrangements should enable principal buildings to be situated so that each longest axis lies in an east/west direction, so as to expose the front or rear of the building to the south. Attention should be given to ensuring that expected building locations are not shaded by topographic features or by buildings on adjoining properties.
6.1.5 Where a lot in a subdivision has frontage on, or potential access from more than one roadway, it shall be accessed by the lower intensity roadway unless alternative access is specifically approved by the Commission upon recommendation of the Town Engineer.
6.2 ROADS
6.2.1 All roads in any subdivision shall have free access to one or more State highways or Town approved roads.
6.2.2 Where the proposed subdivision abuts an existing Town road, the applicant shall consult with the Board of Selectmen to determine the right-of-way width along such road and the possible need to deed additional land to permit its widening. All subdivision approvals shall require that all land within a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet from the centerline of the traveled portion of existing roads be deeded to the Town of North Stonington and this shall be so noted on the map presented to the Commission for approval. In industrial and commercial subdivisions, the land required shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the road centerline.
A. No lots shall be conveyed by the applicant until the road right-of-way for the entire subdivision along its frontage with an existing Town Road, as denoted on the plan, has been deeded to and accepted by the Town or an executable deed has be submitted to the Town for recording purposes.
6.2.3 Road jogs with centerline offset of less than one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided.
6.2.4 Except where impractical because of topography or other conditions, all roads shall join each other so that for a distance of at least fifty (50) feet the road is at right angles to the road it joins and has a maximum grade of three (3) percent.
6.2.5 Four-way intersections shall generally be minimized and shall, in any event, be specifically approved by the Commission upon recommendation of the Town Engineer.

Page- 26 Section 6- Subdivision Design Standards
6.2.6 To the maximum extent possible, roads shall be laid out in a generally east/west direction to facilitate solar orientation of buildings on abutting lots.
6.2.7 The road standards presented in Table 6-1 shall be complied with unless:
A. a waiver is granted by the Commission in accordance with Section 3.5 of these Regulations, or
B. an alternative design standard (such as a boulevard or a hammerhead turnaround, for example) is found by the Commission to be acceptable in the specific circumstances.
6.2.8 Cul-de-Sac Length Limitation
A. Unless otherwise approved by the Commission, no permanent cul-de-sac shall be created that:
1. is less than two hundred and fifty (250) feet in length; or
2. exceeds six hundred (600) feet in length measured from the center of the nearest intersection, whether inside or outside of the subdivision that has two (2) means of access and egress to the center of the turnaround.
B. With receipt of approval that authorizes a modification of the provisions of the road ordinance, a greater length for a permanent cul-de-sac may be permitted by the Commission for:
1. significant preservation of open space;
2. significant preservation of natural features;
3. exemplary overall subdivision design;
4. the demonstrated likelihood of future road extension and connection to other streets providing an alternative means of access and egress; or
5. the creation of similar community benefits.
C. If allowing a greater length of cul-de-sac, the Commission may, in its sole discretion, require or accept plan modifications which offset the increased development in a less accessible location, such as:
1. increased pavement thickness and/or road shoulders that will accommodate emergency vehicles;
2. increased open space preservation and/or fewer lots in the overall development; and/or
3. other improvements such as significant community amenities.

6.4 DRAINAGE
An adequate system of storm water drainage shall be provided and no natural watercourse shall be altered or obstructed in such a way as to reduce the natural runoff capacity unless substitute means of runoff are provided. If deemed necessary by the Commission, the developer shall provide additional capacity in adjacent culverts and other drainage features for accommodating increased runoff from the proposed development. All existing and proposed drainage systems shall be indicated on plans and profile sheets as to their material, size, and location.
6.4.1 The quantity of storm water carried by drains shall be determined by the method prescribed in Technical Release No. 55 of the U. S. Soil Conservation Service, and the design storm shall be fifty (50) years except for bridges, in which case it shall be one hundred (100) years.
6.4.2 Drainage rights-of-way through lots shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide, and follow property lines wherever possible. The Commission may require culverts and other storm water drainage installations, where it deems necessary, to connect with one or more natural watercourses. All necessary easements for drainage shall be provided prior to plan approval.
6.5 FLOODING CONSIDERATIONS
The Commission shall determine that proposed subdivisions are reasonably safe from flooding. When a subdivision is proposed in an "A" Zone on the Towns Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, it shall be reviewed to assure the following:
6.5.1 That all proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone areas.
6.5.2 That all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
6.5.3 That adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
6.5.4 That new and replacement water supply systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems.
6.5.5 That new and replacement sanitary sewer systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems or discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
6.5.6 That on-site sewage disposal systems are located to avoid their impairment or contamination from them during flooding.
6.5.7 The Planning and Zoning Commission shall require the applicant to provide BFE data for all subdivision proposals, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis performed by a registered professional engineer that generates BFEs for all subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions.

6.6 OPEN SPACE, PARKS, PLAYGROUNDS, AND MUNICIPAL LAND
6.6.1 General
A. As provided for in Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-25, every subdivision of land for residential use shall provide for open space in order to:
1. protect and conserve natural features;
2. protect and conserve community resources;
3. establish greenbelts and other linkages that connect open spaces;
4. provide for parks, playgrounds, and other active and passive recreation areas;
5. supplement existing open space areas;
6. provide, protect, or enhance local trails;
7. protect and provide for the preservation of agricultural land and uses;
8. implement the open space and other recommendations in the Plan of Conservation and Development;
9. protect and preserve the rural character of the Town of North Stonington by retaining natural open space areas and scenic views where they are most visible from public roads and parks and by preventing unsightly development of ridge tops and providing natural buffers;
10. protect and preserve forest resources;
11. protect and preserve natural resources including ledge outcroppings, stands of unique trees, unusual or unique wildlife habitats and other unusual and unique topographical and physical features;
12. protect and preserve historical and cultural resources, including historic and prehistoric archaeological sites, stone walls, trails, and cemeteries;
13. protect ground water, watersheds, aquifers and other aquatic resources; and/or
14. protect important ecological resources.
B. This open space requirement may, with approval of the Commission, be met through:
1. dedication of land within the proposed subdivision or resubdivision in fee or by conveyance of a conservation easement;
2. dedication of land acceptable to the Commission elsewhere in North Stonington,
3. a fee-in-lieu-of-land donation;
4. dedication of land and a fee-in-lieu-of-land-donation; or

Page- 30 Section 6- Subdivision Design Standards
C. The Commission may solicit or accept comment regarding the proposed land dedication from any Town board or commission, Town official, land trust, or qualified consultant with respect to:
1. the need for a land dedication in the subdivision;
2. the land resources available;
3. the implications of a dedication in relation to open space system in the Town; and/or
4. preferred ownership.
6.6.36.6.2 Dedication of Land
A. Where the open space requirement shall be met through the dedication of land:
1. at least fifteen (15) percent of the total area of the subdivision shall be so dedicated; and
2. unless waived or modified by the Commission, the area reserved to meet the minimum dedication requirement shall not consist of a greater percentage of area classified as wetland, watercourse, 100-year floodplain, or slopes in excess of twenty-five (25) percent than the parcel as whole. Such information shall be provided for the overall parcel and the proposed open space by a Connecticut-licensed civil engineer or a Connecticut-licensed landscape architect.
EXAMPLE: Say a fifty (50) acre parcel of land is being subdivided and twenty (20) percent of the entire parcel is wetland, watercourse, 100-year floodplain, or steep slopes.
Regulation 6.6.2(A)(1) requires that at least fifteen (15) percent of the fifty (50) acres shall be provided as open space (at least seven and one half (7.5) acres).
Regulation 6.6.2(A)(2) requires that no more than twenty (20) percent of the seven and one half (7.5) acres can be wetland, watercourse, 100-year floodplain, or steep slopes (no more than one and a half (1.5) acres). In other words, six (6) acres of the open space must be land that is not wetland, watercourse, 100-year floodplain, or steep slopes.
More land on the parcel may be dedicated as open space but at least six (6) acres of the open space must be land that is not wetland, watercourse, 100-year floodplain, or steep slopes.
B. If an applicant/developer transfers land to the Town for municipal purposes other than for required road widening, such transfer may be considered by the Commission as a credit toward any dedication requirements.
1. Such dedication shall be in locations deemed proper by the Commission.
2. Such dedication shall be shown on the subdivision plan or on another suitable map if located elsewhere in North Stonington.
SECTION
6
SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 6- Subdivision Design Standards Page-31
C. When a subdivision abuts an existing open space, the Commission may require the lot lines of such land form a continuation of the existing open space to provide a single, unified area.
D. Land intended for dedication shall be suitable for the purpose intended.
E. The Commission may defer the requirements for the immediate provision of such land in a subdivision, which is a part of a larger tract of land, provided that the applicant/developer dedicates an area of land in the undeveloped portion of the tract equal to the requirements of this section in the developed portion.
F. In determining the appropriateness of an area proposed for open space or other public purposes, the Commission shall consider:
1. recommendations in the Plan of Conservation and Development, the presence or absence of any existing or potential dedicated open spaces in the area,
2. the opportunities to interconnect existing, proposed, and future open space dedications into a comprehensive greenway and trail system,
3. the size of the subdivision, and
4. responses to any referrals regarding need, resources, connection to the open space system of the Town and preferred ownership.
G. Fee title or a conservation easement shall be deeded in perpetuity and the applicant shall designate which entity is, or entities are, proposed to own the fee title or conservation easement to ensure its permanent protection as provided in these Regulations. The following are acceptable grantees of open space:
1. the Town for conservation or other purposes; or
2. the Town for active recreational purposes after all improvements have been completed; or
3. a recognized private organization legally constituted to accept and to maintain land for conservation purposes (such as a land trust) under terms acceptable to the Commission; or
4. a private association consisting of the owners of the lots within the subdivision (i.e. homeowners association) for specified recreational or conservation purposes upon such terms and conditions, as approved by the Commission, that will protect the public welfare and assure the continued use of the open space for the purpose intended. A copy of the homeowners deed and the by-laws of the homeowners association shall be submitted with the application.
H. Fee title or a conservation easement deeded to a private organization or a home owners association and shall provide in such deed that ownership shall revert to the Town for recreational or conservation purposes if such corporation or association shall cease to exist or shall relinquish ownership. If the land in question has been preserved as open space prior to the filing of the application via a conservation easement, it shall be sufficient that the existing conservation easement contains a reverter clause to a recognized private organization legally constituted to accept and
SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION

Page- 32 Section 6- Subdivision Design Standards
to maintain land for conservation purposes (such as land trust) or is otherwise satisfactory to the Commission.
I. The Commission may require that any land have direct access to a public road through a right-a-way dedicated to public use and that it be graded and improved to allow for pedestrian access.
J. Land areas to be dedicated for open space shall not be used as a depository for brush, stumps, earth, building materials, or debris, except as may arise from activities permitted under a conservation easement.
K. Whenever the Commission has required land areas to be dedicated for open space, standard markers (available from the Town) shall be placed in the field delineating the area. No endorsement of the approved plans shall occur, and no mylars shall be recorded with the Town Clerk until the applicant has verified in writing that the markers have been installed and the Commission, or its delegated representative, has field verified the installation.
L. Where land reserved for open space abuts land used for residential purposes or other uses that are reasonably likely to lead to encroachment, its boundaries shall be set in the field and marked by permanent, readily visible markers at the intersection of any lot line, road or perimeter lines and at intervals along the boundaries of all open space parcels deemed sufficient by the Commission to protect the open space land from encroachment and insure that its boundaries are identifiable.
M. Where open space or easements are provided without frontage or other public access, a right of way shall be granted to the recipient of the open space or easement for the purpose of maintenance and monitoring.
6.6.3 Fee In Lieu of Open Space
A. Where dedication of land as open space will not meet the purposes of this section, the Commission may:
1. authorize the applicant/developer to pay a fee to the Town, or pay a fee to the Town and transfer land to the Town in lieu of any requirement to provide land, or
2. request the applicant/developer pay a fee to the Town or pay a fee to the Town and transfer land in lieu of the requirement to provide land.
B. If payment of a fee in lieu of open space is proposed by the applicant/developer, the Commission may refuse such fee if it determines, in its sole discretion, that there are acceptable areas on the Subdivision, which merit preservation by one of the methods, set forth in these Regulations.
SECTION
6
SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 6- Subdivision Design Standards Page-33
C. The open space payment shall be placed in the Towns Open Space Fund.
D. Unless otherwise agreed by the Commission and the applicant/developer, (such as a fee based upon the assessed market value of the land or other basis), fee in lieu of open space procedures shall be in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes 8-25, as amended, provided that any required appraisal shall be performed by a Senior Residential Appraiser (SRA) or a Member Appraisal Institute (MAI).
E. The fee in lieu of open space may be paid in one lump sum by the applicant/developer or may be made in partial payments at the time of the sale of each approved lot in the subdivision. If partial payments are to be made, each payment shall be prorated in value relative to the number of approved lots in the subdivision.
F. When fractional payments are provided in lieu of open space, the applicant/developer shall execute a mortgage securing the fee-in-lieu-of-open space and such mortgage shall be recorded on the Town of North Stonington Land Records with a priority, form, and substance acceptable to the Town Land Use Attorney. Partial releases shall be provided upon the tender of each fractional payment.
6.6.4 Open Space Dedication Exemption. In accordance with Connecticutwith Connecticut General Statutes 8-25 as amended, the open space dedication requirement shall not apply if:
A. the transfer of all land in a subdivision of less than five (5) parcels is to a parent, child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, or first cousin for no consideration; or
B. the subdivision contains affordable housing, as defined in Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-39a, equal to twenty percent (20) percent or more of the total housing to be constructed in such subdivision.
6.7 ROAD SIGNS

7.1 MONUMENTS
Monuments shall be set at corners and angles of all roads and at all points of curvature and points of tangency of curved roads. Monuments shall be set plumb, in line with road lines one (1) inch above finish grade. They shall be of granite or reinforced concrete, not less than four (4) inches square and thirty (30) inches long, with a brass or copper plug or drill hole marking the center of the square. No permanent monuments shall be installed until all construction that could destroy or disturb the monuments is completed.
7.1.1 At least one (1) front corner of each lot shall be marked with a monument. Markers indicating all other lot boundaries may be solid iron rod, one (1) inch outside diameter, three (3) feet long, all set so that six (6) inches of rod is exposed above proposed grades.
7.2 ROAD GRADING
The entire area of each road within its exterior lines shall be cleared of all stumps, brush, roots, rocks, or boulders, and like material; and of all trees and shrubs not intended for preservation. Existing trees and shrubs standing within the exterior lines of the road, and suitable for preservation, shall be shown on the plan and may be preserved with the approval of the Commission.
7.2.1 Within each road, the full length and width of the roadway shall be excavated to a depth of at least eighteen and one half (18.5) inches below the finished surface or filled, as necessary, to a sub grade parallel to the finished grade herein specified. If the soil is soft or yielding, or contains rocks or boulders, clay, sand pockets, peat or other material detrimental to the sub grade, such material shall be removed to such additional depth as required by the Board of Selectmen and replaced with an approved well-compacted material, such as two and one half (2.5) inch trap rock. Where fills are very deep, the material shall be placed in layers of approximately six (6) inches and thoroughly compacted.
7.2.2 The roadway sub grade shall be inspected as provided hereafter (second inspection) prior to any further roadway construction. However, this inspection may be combined with the inspection of underground services (first inspection) at the election of the subdivider (see Section 7.16 of these Regulations).
7.2.3 Existing Roads
A. Access Improvements. Whenever any subdivision is proposed for land accessible only by an unpaved road, or by an existing Town Road that does not conform with the minimum requirements of grade, alignment, width and construction set forth in these regulations, or in the Town Road Ordinance (as amended), and the Commission determines that the subdivision plan would be contrary to the public safety unless such road was altered or improved where it fronts the proposed subdivision, the Commission may disapprove such plan or may condition its approval upon alteration of such street by and at the expense of the sub-divider, or may disapprove such plan until the Board of Selectmen has authorized expenditures for such improvements.
B. Frontage Improvements. Whenever any subdivision is proposed for land which fronts on an existing Town Road which does not conform with the minimum requirements of width and construction set forth in these Regulations, the sub-divider shall improve such frontage from the centerline of the road to the required frontage
IMPROVEMENT SPECIFICATIONS
SECTION
7
Page - 38 Section 7  Improvement Specifications
road line, in accordance with these Regulations and/or Town Road Ordinance (as amended). Where such improvement from the centerline is impractical, the Commission may require improvements of comparable value to be performed along the existing road frontage of the subdivision, or adjacent frontage impacted by the subdivision. In the alternative, the Commission may require that the cost of such improvements shall be paid to the Board of Selectmen, or its designated agent, in lieu of the completion of such improvements by the applicant. Such payment shall be held in a separate fund to be used exclusively for the improvements of the subject road in ways that directly benefit the future owners of the lots in the subdivision.
In making the determinations set forth in the preceding two (2) paragraphs, the Commission shall take into account the roads ability to handle the increased volumes of traffic which will be generated by the proposed subdivision, the ability of school buses and emergency vehicles to travel the road safely, the drainage conditions of the road, and the general ability of any vehicle to use the road safely.
C. Scenic Roads; Stone Walls. Frontage improvements, as described in the proceeding section, may be modified by the Commission in order to achieve the objectives of the Scenic Roads Ordinance (as amended). In addition, the Commission may waive any requirements for improvements described in this regulation in order to preserve existing stone walls or other historic items that are a part of the Towns historic character. Any modifications pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with the Scenic Road Ordinance (as amended) and the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations.
D. Exemption. The requirements of these Regulations (7.2.3) as they apply to a subdivision of three (3) or less building lots for conveyance to family members from the resident parcel owner, may be waived by a 3/4 vote of the Commission.
7.3 ROAD CONSTRUCTION
Roadways shall be constructed for the full length and width. The centerline of such roadways shall coincide with the centerline of the road right-of-way, unless a minor variation is specifically approved by the Commission.
7.3.1 Roadways shall be provided with a twelve (12) inch base course, a four (4) inch penetrated stone course, and a two and one half (2.5) inch wearing surface.
7.3.2 A rolled gravel base course shall be spread over the sub grade rolled and compacted in six (6) inch layers with a 10-ton roller, 15-ton in commercial and industrial subdivision, to a depth of twelve (12) inches and shall conform to the typical cross section.
7.3.3 The penetrated stone course shall be uniformly blended and shall conform to the requirements of the current edition of the Connecticut Department of Transportation, Bureau of Highways Standard Specifications for Roads, Bridges, and Incidental Construction and shall consist of clean two (2) inch course aggregate evenly applied and rolled to a depth of four (4) inches. The rolling shall be sufficient to form a uniform surface. These surfaces shall then be penetrated with penetration asphalt, applying between 1.35 and 1.75 gallons per square yard. Immediately following the applications of the penetration asphalt, sufficient one half (.5) inch keystone shall be spread to fill voids and allow a roller to pass over and not break or disturb the top of the stone course. This shall then be rolled to a smooth true surface two and one half (2.5) inches below the
SECTION

Section 7  Improvement Specifications Page-39
proposed finished grade as shown on the profile, and having a transverse grade parallel to that shown on the applicable cross-section plan. Prior to any further construction, the roadway shall again be inspected as hereinafter provided (third inspection).
7.3.4 All road-wearing surfaces shall be paved to the full width specified herein to a compacted thickness of three (3) inches with Bituminous Concrete Pavement. The aggregate shall be composed, mixed, and laid out in two courses as specified in the Connecticut Department of Transportation, Bureau of Highways Standard Specifications for Roads, Bridges, and Incidental Construction.
7.3.5 Upon completion of the pavement, the roadway shall again be inspected, as hereinafter provided (fourth inspection).
7.4 CURBING
Unless waived by vote of the Commission, curbing shall be installed along each edge of the roadway on all roads as shown on the plan.
7.4.1 When curbed intersections involve one (1) or more roads having grassed shoulders, the curbing shall be placed at the edge of the roadway and the pavement on the road or roads with such shoulders shall be widened to the full width of the roadway (thus meeting the curb) within fifty (50) feet of the intersection, tapering down to normal width within seventy-five (75) feet thereof.
7.4.2 Curbing required hereunder shall be either standard granite or Portland cement concrete curbing, as required by the Commission as specified in the Connecticut Department of Transportation, Bureau of Highways Standard Specifications for Roads, Bridges, and Incidental Construction.
7.5 SIDEWALKS AND TRAILS
Sidewalks shall be constructed as required in Section 6.3 of these Regulations.
7.5.1 Sidewalks shall have a finished grade in relation to the finished grade of the roadway as shown on the applicable cross-section plan. When unusual physical land characteristics or topographic conditions require, the Commission may approve the placement of a sidewalk at a greater distance from the roadway or at a higher or lower elevation in relation thereto, provided such variation is indicated on the plan.
7.5.2 In constructing all sidewalks, the material shall be removed for the full width of the sidewalk to the sub grade at least ten (10) inches below the approved finished grade, and also all soft spots and other undesirable material below such sub grade shall be replaced with a good binding material and rolled with a 2-ton roller or equivalent. Unless the applicant elects to install cement concrete sidewalks (built according to specifications of the Connecticut Department of Transportation), the excavated area shall be filled with at least eight (8) inches of select gravel containing some binding material and compressed and rolled to a surface with the pitch parallel to that shown on the applicable cross-section plan. Sidewalks shall then be paved to a thickness of two (2) inches with bituminous concrete pavement.
7.5.3 In residential developments, public trails interconnecting activity nodes in North Stonington and existing and potential future protected open space are preferred to

sidewalks. Public trails or sidewalks, where required by the Commission, shall be constructed as follows.
7.5.4 Public trails shall be built to a minimum width of five (5) feet with existing material removed to a depth of six (6) inches and replaced with stone dust.
7.6 DRAINAGE
The construction of the drainage system, including methods of construction and quality of materials used, shall be in conformity with the subdivision plan and the details shall conform to the details of these Regulations and of the Connecticut Department of Transportation Standards Specifications, unless specifically accepted by the Commission.
7.6.1 All catch basins shall be constructed of brick (either clay or concrete, or of cement concrete, or of cement concrete blocks, laid in mortar and plastered on the outside, and standard D frames and grates.) Granite head walls shall be installed where required by the Board of Selectmen. A granite mouth curb is to be furnished and set as directed by the Board of Selectmen. All catch basins shall have an inside diameter of at least four (4) feet, and shall be constructed to a minimum depth of four (4) feet below the invert of the outflow pipe. Joints of all drainpipes shall be sealed unless open joints are specifically approved by the Board of Selectmen. All drainage pipes shall be reinforced concrete; there shall be a minimum cover of two (2) feet.
7.6.2 Pipe drains, where used, should be designed to flow full with the hydraulic gradient at the crown. However, in flat slope areas, surcharge may be allowed with the hydraulic gradient at a minimum depth of one (1) foot below the ground level. In determining the capacity of concrete pipe drains, the Manning formula should be used with the coefficient of fraction n equal to 0.013. The minimum velocity at design flow should be two and one half (2.5) feet per second (fps) and the maximum should be fifteen (15) fps.
7.6.3 In some cases, earth and stone-paved open channels should be used. The typical section of the earth channel should have a flat bottom and side slopes of one (1) vertical on two (2) horizontal with the top of the slope at least one (1) foot higher than the design water surface. The maximum velocity allowed in an open earth channel at design flow should be six (6) fps. A coefficient of friction n equal to 0.030 should be used for both the earth and stone-paved channels.
7.6.4 Where feasible, stormwater should be directed to enter the nearest open stream channel. Stormwater shall not be permitted to cross any roadway upon the surface, but must be piped underground. Catch basins shall be located on both sides of the roadway on continuous grades at intervals of not more than three hundred (300) feet for commercial and industrial subdivisions, and four hundred (400) feet for all other subdivisions, at all sags in the roadway, and near the corners of the roadway at intersecting roads.
7.6.5 Proper connections shall be made with any existing public drainage system within four hundred (400) feet of the subdivision. Where adjacent property is not subdivided and no public drain is within four hundred (400) feet, provisions shall be made for extension of the system by continuing appropriate drains to the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at such size and grade as will allow for their proper protection.
7.6.6 All storm drains, sewers, culverts, manholes, water mains and laterals, shutoff valves, and hydrants shall be inspected prior to any back filling of trenches or other covering of
SECTION
7
IMPROVEMENT SPECIFICATIONS
Section 7  Improvement Specifications Page-41
structure. Following such inspection, the fill material shall be carefully placed around the structures and rammed and compacted to a depth of one (1) foot before completing the filling.
7.6.7 No more than fifty (50) feet of surface drainage from any driveway shall drain directly onto a State highway or Town-accepted road without specific approval from the First Selectman or Town Engineer.
7.6.8 Subdivision drainage designs should demonstrate a zero increase in the peak rate of Runoff (100 year storm) from the site after development unless such requirement is waived by the Commission upon recommendation of the Town Engineer.
7.6.9 Detention basins, which are designed to be self-draining and have a positive drainage outlet, are encouraged to mitigate the accelerated runoff, which can result from development, and to renovate storm water runoff. Retention basins are discouraged. No basin shall have a side slope steeper than 4:1 unless waived by the Commission upon recommendation of the Town Engineer.
7.6.10 Infiltration or dry well drainage systems are discouraged unless such systems are designed with a positive storm drainage outlet. It shall be the sole discretion of the Commission shall determine if such systems are appropriate
7.7 PLANTING STRIPS
Planting strips of a width required by Table 6-1, and in accordance with the layout as shown on the plan, shall be provided on each side of the roadway.
7.7.1 The finished grade of such planting strips in relation to the finished grade of the roadway shall be as shown on the applicable cross-section plan. Where unusual physical land characteristics or topographic conditions exist or where trees, shrubs, or other natural features are suitable for preservation because of their location, species, or condition, the Commission may approve the construction of a planting strip irregular or sloped in cross section, provided such variation is indicated on the plan, and that no portion of the planting strip will project above a plane sloped two horizontal to one vertical upward from the edge of the roadway or be below a plane sloped two horizontal to one vertical downward.
7.7.2 No utility poles or trees shall be placed or retained within the planting strip so as to be closer than six (6) feet from the edge of the roadway.
7.8 SIDE SLOPES
The area in back of the sidewalk or, where no sidewalk is constructed, the area in back of the required planting strip shall be graded to a point where it coincides with the finished grade of abutting lots in such a manner that no portion thereof within the exterior lines of the road will project above a plane sloped two horizontal to one vertical from the edge of the sidewalk or grass lot, or be below a plane sloped two horizontal to one vertical downward.
7.9 GUIDE RAILS
Guide rails shall be placed along all roads as deemed necessary by the Commission, and shall be of such quantity and quality, as the Commission shall direct. The Commission may require the use of wooden or core ten guard rail systems.
IMPROVEMENT SPECIFICATIONS
SECTION

Page - 42 Section 7  Improvement Specifications
7.10 LOAMING
The top four (4) inches of planting strips and side slopes shall consist of good quality loam, screened, raked, and rolled with a hand roller to grade. The loam shall be seeded with lawn grass seed applied in sufficient quantity to assure adequate coverage, rolled when the loam is moist.
7.11 ROAD SIGNS
Road signs which, in the opinion of the Commission, are of the type commonly used on public ways in the Town, and bearing the names of the road as indicated on the plan, shall be erected at all intersections of roads in the subdivision as prescribed in Section 6.7 of these Regulations.
7.12 WATER SUPPLY
Water supply and distribution systems shall be installed in accordance with the specifications of the Southeastern Connecticut Water Authority (SCWA) or the Connecticut Department of Health, whichever has jurisdiction. In accordance with Section 13 of Special Act 67-381, as amended by Special Act 73-133 of the Connecticut General Assembly, SCWA may exercise jurisdiction when it is the intention of the applicant to develop a well water supply on the basis of studies that indicate a maximum requirement in excess of fifty (50) gallons per minute, or when the tract to be subdivided contains fifty (50) acres or more and is intended to contain two (2) or more dwelling units to be served by a single water supply.
7.13 SEWAGE DISPOSAL
All sewage shall be disposed of by subsurface sewage disposal systems approved by the Town Health Officer or by other methods approved by the Department of Environmental Protection or the State Department of Health, all in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Connecticut Public Health Code.
7.14 UNDERGROUND SERVICES
Utilities on every lot within the subdivision, whether serving that lot or another lot, shall be installed underground; except where, in the opinion of the Zoning Enforcement Officer, and described in writing by him or her, this burial will cause irreversible environmental damage or could present an unsafe condition.
For all new subdivision roads, and new installations on existing roads that abut and serve the subdivision, all utilities shall be installed underground except surface-mounted transformers, connection boxes, meter cabinets, and temporary utility service lines during construction.
7.15 CLEAN UP
The entire area must be cleaned up so as to leave a neat and orderly appearance free from debris and other objectionable materials. All catch basins shall be properly cleaned out.
7.15.1 Following the completion of this and other items of work, a final inspection (fifth inspection) shall be made.
7.16 INSPECTION AND CONTROL
The applicant shall employ, at his/her own expense, an engineer to set all lines and grades in a manner satisfactory to the Commission.

SECTION 1
TITLE AND AUTHORITY
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable
and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have
been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential
to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and
control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to
the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and
watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated
use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or
obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures or other uses, all of which have
despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity
has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and
ecology of the State of Connecticut and has imperiled and will continue to imperil the
quality of the environment, thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and
recreational values and benefits of the State for its citizens now and forever more. The
preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary,
undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and
is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the State. It is, therefore,
the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the State by making provisions
for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and
watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving
water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local
authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish
and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the
natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution;
protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic,
aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the
State's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution,
misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the
economic growth of the State and the use of its land with the need to protect its
environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the State the
safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and
enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations
of the Town of North Stonington".
1.3 The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency of the Town of North Stonington was
established in accordance with an ordinance adopted 7/15/73, and shall implement the
purposes and provisions of these regulations and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses
Act in the Town of North Stonington.
1.4 These Regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in
accordance with the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these
regulations.
1.5 The Agency shall enforce all provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act
and shall issue, issue with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits
for all Regulated Activities affecting inland wetlands and watercourses in the Town of
North Stonington pursuant to Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut

INVENTORY OF REGULATED AREAS
3.1 The map of wetlands and watercourses entitled "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Map,
North Stonington, Connecticut," delineates the general location and boundaries of inland
wetlands and the general location of watercourses. Copies of this map are available for
inspection in the office of the Town Clerk or of the Inland Wetlands Commission. In all
cases, the precise location of the wetlands and watercourses shall be determined by the
actual character of the land, the distribution of the wetland soil types, and locations of
watercourses. Where soil classifications are required, such determination shall be made
by field inspection and testing conducted by a certified soil scientist. Where watercourse
determinations are required, such determination may be made by other qualified
individuals having appropriate training or experience. However, areas designated as
wetlands or watercourses on the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Map shall be
presumed to be wetlands and watercourses, respectively, unless the Agency makes a
contrary finding based on evidence it receives. The Agency may use aerial photography,
remote sensing imagery, resource mapping, soils maps, site inspection observations or
other information in determining the location of wetlands and watercourses.
-7-
3.2 The Agency or its designated agent(s) shall monitor and maintain general surveillance of
all Regulated Areas. The Agency may amend its map as more accurate information
becomes available. Any person may petition for an amendment to the map. Petitioners
shall bear the burden of proof for all requested map amendments. Such map amendments
are subject to the public hearing process outlined in Section 16 of these Regulations.
However, whenever the Agency is considering an application for a permit for a Regulated
Activity, nothing in these Regulations shall be deemed to preclude the Agency from
making a decision based upon the actual character of the land, the distribution of the
wetland soil types and locations of watercourses, where such factors have been
demonstrated by competent evidence to be different from those shown on the official
map.
SECTION 4
PERMITTED USES AS OF RIGHT AND NONREGULATED USES
Section 22a-40 of the Connecticut General Statutes contains a list of operations and uses that are
either nonregulated or permitted in inland wetlands and watercourses as of right. For
informational purposes, the operations and uses allowed by that Statute as of the date of
enactment of these Regulations are set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 below. It is the intention of
the Agency that the uses described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 shall be deemed to be coextensive
with, and not any more or less inclusive than, those specified in that Statute, as it may be
amended.
4.1 The following operations and uses were permitted in inland wetlands and watercourses,
as of right, pursuant to CGS Section 22a-40, as of the time of enactment of these
Regulations:
a. Grazing, farming, nurseries, gardening and harvesting of crops and farm ponds of
three acres or less essential to the farming operation, and activities conducted by or
under the authority of, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, for
purposes of wetland or watercourse restoration or enhancement or mosquito
control. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to include road
construction or the erection of buildings not directly related to the farming
operation, relocation of watercourses with continual flow, filling or reclamation of
wetlands or watercourses with continual flow, clear cutting of timber except for the
expansion of agricultural crop land, or the mining of top soil, peat, sand, gravel or
similar material from wetlands or watercourses for the purpose of sale.
b. A residential home (i) for which a building permit has been issued, and/or (ii) on a
subdivision lot, provided the permit was issued or the subdivision was approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission on or before July 1, 1974, and further
provided that no residential home shall be permitted as of right pursuant to this
subsection unless the building permit was obtained on or before July 1, 1987, and
has not expired. Any person claiming a use of wetlands permitted as a right under
this subsection shall document the validity of that claim by providing a certified
copy of the building permit and a site plan showing proposed and existing
topographic contours, house and well locations, septic system, driveway, approval
dates or other necessary information to document his or her right hereunder.
c. Boat anchorage or mooring, not to include dredging or dock construction.
-8-
d. Uses incidental to the enjoyment or maintenance of residential property. Such
incidental uses shall include maintenance of existing structures and landscaping,
but shall not include removal or deposition of more than one cubic yard of material
from or into a wetland or watercourse, or diversion or alteration of a watercourse
without a permit.
e. Construction and operation, by water companies as defined by Section 16-1 of the
Connecticut General Statutes or by municipal water supply systems as provided for
in Chapter 102 of the Connecticut General Statutes, of dams, reservoirs and other

connection with public water supplies, except as provided in Sections 22a-401
through 22a-410 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
f. Maintenance relating to any drainage pipe that existed before the effective date of
any municipal regulations adopted pursuant to Section 22a-42a of the Connecticut
General Statutes or July 1, 1974, whichever is earlier, provided such pipe is on
property that is zoned as residential but that does not contain hydrophytic
vegetation. For purposes of this subsection, maintenance means the removal of
accumulated leaves, soil, and other debris whether by hand or machine, while the
pipe remains in place.
4.2 The following operations and uses were permitted as nonregulated uses in wetlands and
watercourses, pursuant to CGS Section 22a-40, as of the time of enactment of these
Regulations, provided they do not disturb the natural and indigenous character of the
wetland or watercourse by removal or deposition of material, alteration or obstruction of
water flow or pollution of the wetland or watercourse:
a. Conservation of soil, vegetation, water, fish, shellfish, and wildlife. Such operation
or use may include, but is not limited to, minor work to control erosion, or to
encourage proper fish, wildlife and silviculture management practices.
b. Outdoor recreation including play and sporting areas, golf courses, field trials,
nature study, hiking, horseback riding, swimming, skin and scuba diving, camping,
boating, water skiing, trapping, hunting, fishing and shell-fishing and cross-country
skiing where otherwise legally permitted and regulated.
c. Removal or management of non-native invasive species as detailed in an approved
written plan developed by a qualified environmental professional (including but not
limited to a landscape architect, environmental engineer, soil scientist or wetlands
ecologist).
4.3 Movement of equipment in or through wetlands or watercourses must be reviewed by the
Inland Wetlands Enforcement Officer to determine whether such activity requires a
permit.
4.4 All activities in wetlands or watercourses involving filling, excavation, dredging, clear
cutting, clearing, and grading or any other alteration or use of a wetland or watercourse
that is not specifically allowed pursuant to CGS Section 22a-40 and that is defined as a
Regulated Activity by these Regulations shall require a permit from the Agency in
accordance with Section 6 of these Regulations.
-9-
4.5 To carry out the purposes of this Section, any person proposing to carry out a permitted
or nonregulated operation or use of a wetland or watercourse that may disturb the natural
and indigenous character of the wetland or watercourse shall, prior to commencement of
such operation or use, notify the Agency on a form provided by it, and provide the
Agency with sufficient information to enable it to properly determine that the proposed
operation and use is a permitted or nonregulated use of the wetland or watercourse. The
Agency or its designated agent shall rule that the proposed operation or use is a permitted
or a nonregulated use or operation or that a permit is required. Such ruling shall be in
writing and shall be made no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Agency following the meeting at which the request was received. The designated agent
may make such ruling on behalf of the Agency at any time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, if there is any change in State law regarding the definition or
qualifications of an activity to be a use permitted as of right or a nonregulated use before
such use has actually commenced, no ruling made by the Agency under this section shall
protect the proposed use from the effect of such change.
SECTION 5
ACTIVITIES REGULATED BY THE STATE
State law delegates to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection the exclusive
authority to regulate certain types of activities that may affect inland wetlands or watercourses.
For informational purposes, Sections 5.1 through 5.4 describe certain categories of activities for
which the Agency understands that such a delegation has been made to the Commissioner. It is
the intention of the Agency that the categories of activities described in Sections 5.1 through 5.4
shall be deemed to be coextensive with, and not any more or less inclusive than, the activities for
which State law, as it may be amended, has actually delegated such authority to the
Commissioner.
5.1 The Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction over activities undertaken in Regulated
Areas by any department, agency or instrumentality of the State of Connecticut, except
any local or regional board of education, pursuant to Sections 22a-39 or 22a-45a of the
Connecticut General Statues.
5.2 The Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction over activities in tidal wetlands, designated
and regulated pursuant to Sections 22a-28 through 22a-35 of the Connecticut General
Statutes, as amended.
5.3 The Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction over activities authorized under a dam
repair or removal order issued by the Commissioner under Section 22a-402 of the
Connecticut General Statutes or a permit issued by the Commissioner under Sections
22a-403 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Any person receiving such dam repair or
removal order or permit shall not be required to obtain a permit from the Agency for any
action necessary to comply with said dam order or to carry out the activities authorized
by said permit.
5.4 The Commissioner has jurisdiction over the discharge of dredged or fill materials into
wetlands and watercourses pursuant to Section 401 of the Federal Clean Water Act, for
activities regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of that Act.

Stonington, is filed with the Agency not later than fourteen days after the official date of
receipt of such application; or (3) the Agency finds that a public hearing regarding such
application would be in the public interest. The Agency may issue a permit without a
public hearing provided no petition provided for in this Section is filed with the Agency
on or before the fourteenth day after the official date of receipt of the application. Any
public hearing shall be held no later than sixty-five days after the official date of receipt
of the application. All applications and maps and documents relating thereto shall be
open for public inspection.
9.3 The Agency shall publish notice of the public hearing at least twice at intervals of not less
than two days, the first not more than fifteen days and not fewer than ten days, and the
last not less than two days before the date set for the hearing in a newspaper having a
general circulation in each town where the affected wetland or watercourse is located.
9.4 The applicant shall mail notice of the public hearing by certified mail to the owner(s) of
record, as determined by the current Assessor's files, of all abutting land and, if the
applicant is not the owner of the property that is the subject of the application, to the
owners of the property. Such notices shall be mailed no less than fifteen (15) days prior
to the day of the hearing. The applicant must give proof of such mailing to the Agency at
or before the commencement of the hearing.
9.5 In the case of any application which is subject to the notification provisions of Section
8.2 of these Regulations, a public hearing shall not be conducted until the clerk of the
adjoining municipality(s) has received notice of the pendency of the application. Proof of
such notification shall be entered into the hearing record.
9.6 If a public hearing is to be held on any application for a permit, all documentary evidence
regarding the application shall be filed with the Agency in accordance with Section 8.8 of
these Regulations.
SECTION 10
CONSIDERATIONS FOR DECISION
10.1 The Agency may consider the following in making its decision on an application:
a. The application and its supporting documentation;
b. Public comments, evidence and testimony;
c. Reports from other agencies and commissions and organizations including but
not limited to, conservation commissions, planning and zoning commissions,
building officials, health officers and conservation organizations;
d. The Agency may also consider comments on any application from the Natural
Resources Conservation Service, regional planning agencies or other regional
organizations; agencies in adjacent municipalities that may be affected by the
proposed activity, and other technical agencies or conservation organizations;
-16-
e. Non-receipt of comments from agencies and commissions listed above within
any time provided by law shall neither delay nor prejudice the decision of the
Agency.
f. Advice received from Agency staff or Agency consultants after a public hearing
regarding evidence or testimony received before the close of the public hearing.
Such advice should be limited to comments or interpretations of materials that
were received before the close of the public hearing; it should not include new or
additional factual information to which the parties to the public hearing had no
opportunity to be apprised or heard.
10.2 Criteria for Decision. In carrying out the purposes and policies of Sections 22a-36 to
22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to
regulating, licensing and enforcement, the Agency shall take into consideration all
relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. The environmental impact of the proposed action on wetlands and watercourses,
including the effects on the capacity of the inland wetlands and watercourses to
support fish and wildlife, to prevent flooding, to supply and protect surface and
ground waters, to control sediment, to facilitate drainage, to control pollution, to
support recreational activities, and to promote public health and safety.
b. The applicant's purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the
proposed Regulated Activity, which alternatives would cause less or no
environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses. This consideration should
include, but is not limited to, the alternative of taking no action, or postponing
action pending further study, and the alternative of requiring actions of different
nature that would provide similar benefits with different environmental impacts,
such as using a different location for the activity.
c. The relationship between the short-term and long-term impacts of the proposed
Regulated Activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and
enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses;
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources that would
be caused by the proposed Regulated Activity including the extent to which such
activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such
resources, and any mitigation measures that may be considered as a condition of
issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to: (1)
prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or
enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority;
restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources
e. The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the
reasonable use of property that is caused or threatened by the proposed Regulated
Activity. This criterion includes recognition of potential damage from erosion,
turbidity, or siltation, the dangers of flooding and pollution, and the destruction
of the economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and
values of wetlands and watercourses to the community; and
f. Impacts of the proposed Regulated Activity on wetlands or watercourses outside
the area for which the activity is proposed, and future activities associated with,
or reasonably related to, the proposed Regulated Activity that are made inevitable
by the proposed Regulated Activity and that may have an impact on wetlands or
watercourses.
10.3 In the case of any application that received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by the
Agency that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or
watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the Agency finds on the basis of the
-17-
record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In making this finding the
Agency shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in Section 10.2. The finding
and the reasons therefore shall be stated on the record and included in the Agencys
minutes.
10.4 If an application is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible and prudent
alternatives to the proposed Regulated Activity that may have less adverse impacts on
wetlands or watercourses, the Agency shall, to the extent required by state law, propose
on the record in writing the types of alternatives the applicant may investigate, provided
this section shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant to prove
entitlement to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed Regulated Activity.
10.5 For purposes of Section 10, the terms wetlands and watercourses include aquatic,
plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and the term habitats
means areas or environments in which an organism or biological population normally
lives or occurs.
10.6 The Agency shall not deny or condition an application for a Regulated Activity in an area
outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant, or
animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical, chemical or
biological characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses.
10.7 A conclusion that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does not create a
presumption that a permit should be issued. The applicant has the burden of
demonstrating that the application is consistent with the purposes and policies of these
Regulations and Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes.
10.8 The time within which the Agency must render a decision on an application is set forth in
Section 9.1 of these Regulations.
SECTION 11
DECISION PROCESS AND PERMIT
11.1 The Agency, or its duly authorized agent acting pursuant to Section 13 of these
Regulations, may, in accordance with Section 10 of these Regulations, grant the
application as filed or grant it upon other terms, conditions, limitations or modifications
of the Regulated Activity designed to carry out the purposes and policies of the Act, or
deny the application. Such terms may include any reasonable measures that would
mitigate the impacts of the Regulated Activity and would: (a) prevent or minimize
pollution or other environmental damage, (b) maintain or enhance existing environmental
quality, or (c) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive
wetland or watercourse resources. The time within which the Agency must render a
decision on an application is set forth in Section 9.1 of these Regulations.
11.2 To the extent required by state law, the Agency shall state upon its record and in its
minutes the reasons and basis for its decision. Such decision shall be based fully on the
materials properly received into the Agencys record and shall, as applicable and in
accordance with Section 10 of these Regulations, incorporate a statement relative to the
consideration of feasible and prudent alternatives.
-18-
11.3 The Agency shall notify the applicant and any named parties to the proceeding of its
decision within fifteen (15) days after the date of the decision by certified mail and the
Agency shall cause notice of its order in the issuance or denial of the permit to be
published in a newspaper having general circulation in the Town of North Stonington.
The failure of the Agency to provide such notice or to make such publication shall not be
deemed to nullify, invalidate or otherwise affect such decision except as may be required
by state law. In addition, state law may allow the applicant to provide for the publication
of a notice of decision in the event the Agency fails to make timely publication.
11.4 If an activity authorized by the inland wetland permit also involves an activity which
requires zoning or subdivision approval, the Agency will provide a copy of its decision
and report on the application to the Town of North Stonington Planning and Zoning
Commission as may be required by state law. The failure of the Agency to submit any
such decision or report to the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not be deemed to
nullify, invalidate or otherwise affect such decision except as may be required by state
law.
11.5 If the Agency denies the permit as incomplete or if it grants a permit with terms,
conditions, limitations or modifications, the applicant may attempt to modify the proposal
to the Agency's satisfaction. If the modifications relate to an application that was
granted, as aforesaid, the Agency shall determine whether the proposed modification
requires the filing of new application.
11.6 In accordance with C.G.S. Section 22a-42a(d)(2), any permit issued under this section for
the development of property for which an approval is required under C.G.S. Sections 8-3,
8-25 or 8-26 shall be valid for five years, provided the Agency may establish a specific
time period within which any regulated activity shall be conducted. Any permit issued
under this section for any other activity shall be valid for not less than two years and not
more than five years. If the Agency fails to designate a specific duration, the term of the
permit shall be deemed to be five years. Any such permit shall be renewed upon
application of the permit holder, as provided in Section 12 of these Regulations, unless
the agency finds that there has been a substantial change in circumstances that requires a
new permit application or an enforcement action has been undertaken with regard to the
regulated activity for which the permit was issued, provided no permit shall be valid for
more than ten years. All activities specified on a permit must be completed by the
expiration of the permit or the permittee will be in violation of the North Stonington
Inland Wetlands Regulations and may be subject to penalties as specified in the
Connecticut General Statutes.
11.7 If a bond or insurance is required in accordance with Section 14 of these Regulations, no
Regulated Activities may lawfully begin until the bond is posted according to the
requirements in Section 14.1.
11.8 General conditions on the issuance of all permits:
a. When the Agency has issued a permit, and later finds that the applicant provided
false, deceptive, incomplete or inaccurate information upon which the Agency
relied in granting the permit, the Agency may, after providing a hearing to the
applicant or the applicants successor, modify, suspend or revoke the permit.
b. The Agency has no legal power to determine ownership rights or other legal
interests in property. Therefore, in accepting, or granting any permit under, an
application in which the applicant has claimed ownership rights or other legally
-19-
sufficient interests in the property to make the application, the Agency shall
assume that the applicant has the legal right to make such application and to
conduct the proposed activities on the subject property. Nevertheless, no such
permit shall be deemed to create a property right or interest in any person would
not otherwise be entitled to claim such interest. All permits shall be subject to
any and all public and private rights and to any federal, state, and municipal laws
or regulations pertinent to the property or activity.
c. The permittee shall employ construction management practices consistent with
the terms and conditions of the permit, utilizing Connecticut DEEP regulations,
standards, policies or guidelines to control stormwater discharges and to prevent
erosion and sedimentation and to otherwise prevent pollution of wetlands and
watercourses.
d. All permits issued that have not been completed within five years from the
original date of approval, or within any period of extension granted by the
Agency pursuant to Sections 11.6 and 12, will be subject to formal review by the
Agency and will require a new application.
11.9 Schedule of Construction of Regulated Activity:
Within fifteen (15) days after receiving approval of a Regulated Activity the applicant
will forward to the North Stonington Inland Wetlands office a schedule for commencing
and completing the Regulated Activity. The Applicant shall confirm or revise the
schedule fifteen (15) calendar days prior to commencement of construction. No
Regulated Activities may begin until the sixteenth day after the schedule is submitted
unless the Agency has expressly authorized such commencement when granting the
permit.
11.10 Construction of a Regulated Activity:
The Agency may require the following as part of a condition of approval:
a. That the construction of a Regulated Activity shall be under the supervision of a
properly qualified professional engineer, wetlands scientist, or other relevant
professional. The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all such persons
shall be provided to the Agency prior to the commencement of the permitted
activities.
b. That any such professionals submit periodic reports to the Agency at intervals
chosen by the Agency. Such reports should contain a description of any work
already completed, work anticipated and scheduled for subsequent periods, and
reports of any problems. The failure to submit a required report may result in
appropriate enforcement by the Agency or its authorized Agent.
SECTION 12
EXTENSION, TRANSFER AND MODIFICATION
OF REGULATED ACTIVITY PERMITS
12.1 Any application to modify or to extend the expiration date of a previously approved
permit shall be filed with the Agency not later than sixty-five (65) days prior to the
expiration date for the permit in accordance with Section 8. The Agency may accept an
untimely application to extend the expiration date of a permit if the authorized activity is
ongoing and, during the pendency of the application, allow the continuation of work
beyond the expiration date if, in the Agencys judgment, the permit is likely to be
extended and the public interest or environment will be best served by not interrupting
-20-
the activity. Except as may otherwise be provided by law, applications for extensions or
modifications of permits granted under previous regulations shall be reviewed and
decided in accordance with the current regulations. If an application is for an extension
of time:
a. The application shall state the reason why the authorized activities were not
initiated or completed within the time originally provided in the permit;
b. The application shall describe any changes in facts or circumstances involved
with or affecting wetlands or watercourses or the property for which the permit
was issued;
c. The application shall describe the extent of work completed at the time of filing
and the schedule for completing the activities authorized in the permit.
12.2 The Agency shall evaluate any application for modification pursuant to Section 10 of
these Regulations and grant the application as filed, grant it with any appropriate terms,
conditions or limitations, or deny it without prejudice with respect to the filing of a
subsequent permit application.
12.3 Applications for renewals of expired permits shall be processed in accordance with
Section 11.6 of these Regulations.
12.4 In the event any change is made in the identity of the owners of record or of the contact
person designated on the application form under which the permit was issued, and the
current owners have not filed with the Agency a written statement identifying the new
owners and/or contact person pursuant to Section 7.5.a of these Regulations, the permit
shall be automatically suspended, and no further Regulated Activities may be conducted
until such notice is filed with the Agency.
SECTION 13
ACTION BY DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT
13.1 The Agency delegates to its Duly Authorized Agent the authority to approve or extend a
permit for an activity that is not located in a wetland or watercourse when such Agent
finds that the conduct of such activity would result in no greater than a minimal impact
on any wetlands or watercourses, provided such agent has completed the comprehensive
training program developed by the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental
Protection pursuant to Section 22a-39 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Requests for
such approval shall be made in accordance with Section 7 on the "Application for
Regulated Activity Permit", a form provided by the Agency, and shall contain the
information specified in Section 7.5 of these Regulations and any other information the
Agency or Designated Agent may reasonably require. Notwithstanding the provisions for
receipt and processing applications prescribed elsewhere in these Regulations, such
Agent may approve or extend such an activity at any time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, the Agency may, by written notice to its agent, temporarily rescind
or suspend the delegation of authority to issue permits.
13.2 Any person receiving such approval from such Designated Agent shall, within ten days of
the date of such approval, publish, at the applicant's expense, notice of the approval in a
newspaper having a general circulation in the Town of North Stonington. Any person
may appeal such decision of such Agent to the Agency within fifteen days after the
publication date of the notice and the Agency shall consider such appeal at its next
regularly scheduled meeting, provided such meeting is no earlier than three business days
-21-
after receipt by such Agency or its Agent of such appeal. Any person may appear and be
heard at the meeting held by the Agency to consider the subject appeal. The Agency
shall, at its discretion, sustain, alter, or reject the decision of its Designated Agent or
require an application for a permit in accordance with Section 7 of these Regulations.
SECTION 14
BOND AND INSURANCE
14.1 The Agency may require, as a permit condition, the filing of a bond with such surety, and
in such amount and form, as may be approved by the Agency.
14.2 The bond or surety shall be conditioned on compliance with all provisions of these
Regulations and the terms, conditions and limitations established in the permit.
14.3 For the purpose of this Section, a bond shall mean one of the following:
a. A surety bond issued by a company licensed to do business in the State of
Connecticut, accompanied by the Power of Attorney of the person executing the
bond for the company. Such company shall have offices in New London County
and must submit certification from its home office that the local office in New
London County has authority to pay out the full value of the bond.
b. A bond secured by an assigned passbook savings account or a certificate of
deposit representing funds deposited in a financial institution that is on the list of
those approved for deposit of Town funds.
c. Cash or certified check in the required amount deposited with the Treasurer of
the Town of North Stonington.
d. An irrevocable letter of credit (original document).
14.4 Bonds shall be executed in accordance with the sample forms supplied by the Agency,
with proper reference made to all maps and plans describing the Regulated Activity
covered by the bond, and shall be satisfactory to the Agency or its agent(s) and to the
Agencys legal counsel as to form, sufficiency and manner of execution.
a. Bonds secured by a passbook savings account or certificate of deposit shall be
accompanied by the savings passbook(s) or certificate of deposit passbook(s)
which shall remain in the possession of the Town until final release of the bond
b. When the bond is secured by a passbook savings account or a certificate of
deposit, the total amount in any single account or certificate may not exceed the
maximum amount per account guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. Where the total amount of the bond required exceeds FDIC
coverage for a single account, additional accounts shall be established to ensure
that all deposited funds are FDIC insured.
14.5 Where a bond has been posted and work covered by the bond has not been completed
within the terms of such bond, the Town may declare the bond to be in default and
require that all work be completed regardless of the extent of development at the time the
bond is declared to be in default.
14.6 Upon written request from the permittee, the bond shall be released by the Agency or its
Agent(s) after approval of the completed Regulated Activity. Upon written request from
the permittee and a determination by the Agency or its Agent(s) that a substantial portion
-22-
of the work guaranteed by the bond has been completed, the Agency or its Designated
Agent may approve partial release(s) of the surety.
SECTION 15
ENFORCEMENT
15.1 The Agency may appoint an Agent or Agents to act in its behalf with the authority to
issue notices of violation or cease and desist orders and carry out other actions or
investigations necessary for the enforcement of these Regulations. In carrying out the
purposes of this Section, the Agency or its Duly Authorized Agent shall take into
consideration the criteria for decision under Section 10.2 of these Regulations.
15.2 When a permit has been issued to conduct Regulated Activities, the Agency or its
Designated Agent, upon receiving the consent of the owner, or authorized agent of the
owner, of the affected property, may make regular inspections of such activities at
reasonable hours. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Agency from requiring,
as a condition of approval of any permit, the opportunity to inspect and monitor any
permitted Regulated Activities.
15.3 When a permit to conduct Regulated Activities has expired, or Regulated Activities have
been conducted without a permit, the Agency or its Designated Agent, upon receiving the
consent of the owner, or authorized agent of the owner, of the affected property, or to the
extent otherwise allowed by law, may inspect such activities at reasonable hours.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the Agency or its Designated Agent from
conducting inspections of such activities without the owners consent, to the extent such
inspections may otherwise be allowed by law.
15.4 If the Agency or its Duly Authorized Agent finds that any person is conducting or
maintaining any activity, facility or condition that is in violation of the Act or these
Regulations, the Agency or its Duly Authorized Agent may:
a. Issue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such person
conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or condition to immediately
cease such activity or to correct such facility or condition. Within ten (10)
calendar days of the issuance of such order the Agency shall hold a hearing to
provide the person an opportunity to be heard and show cause why the order
should not remain in effect. The Agency shall consider the facts presented at the
hearing and, within ten days of the completion of the hearing, notify the person
by certified mail that the original order remains in effect, that a revised order is in
effect, or that the order has been withdrawn. The Agency shall publish notice of
its decision in a newspaper having general circulation in the Town of North
Stonington. The original order shall be effective upon issuance and shall remain
in effect until the Agency affirms, revises or withdraws the order. The issuance
of an order pursuant to this subsection shall not delay or bar an action pursuant to
Section 22a-44(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended.
b. Issue a notice of violation to such person conducting such activity or maintaining
such facility or condition, stating the nature of the violation and the jurisdiction
of the Agency, and prescribing the necessary action and steps to correct the
violation including, without limitation, halting work in wetlands or watercourses.
The Agency may direct that the individual appear at the next regularly scheduled
-23-
meeting of the Agency to discuss the unauthorized activity and or provide a
written reply to the notice, or file a proper application for the necessary permit.
A notice of violation shall not be deemed to be an order of, or an official finding
of facts by, the Agency and shall not be binding on the Agency or on the person
receiving the notice. Failure to carry out the action(s) directed in a notice of
violation may result in the issuance of the order provided in Subsection "a" of
this Section or other enforcement proceedings as provided by law.
c. Suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with the
terms, conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope
of the work as set forth in the application, including application plans. Prior to
revoking any permit, the Agency shall issue notice to the permittee, personally or
by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the facts or conduct that
warrants the intended action. At the hearing the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to show compliance with the permit and any and all requirements for
retention of the permit.
15.5 The permittee shall be notified of the Agency's decision to suspend, revoke, or maintain a
permit by personal service or by certified mail within fifteen (15) days after the date of its
decision.

this subsection for the holding of the hearing and for action on such application, provided
the total of all extensions for all separate parts of the process does not exceed sixty-five
(65) days, or may withdraw such application. The failure of the Agency to act within any
time period specified in this subsection, or any extension thereof, shall not be deemed to
constitute approval of the application.
16.9 The Agency shall make its decision and state in writing the reasons why any change in
the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Map of the Town of North Stonington was made.
16.10 Within ninety (90) days following approval of a boundary change a mylar signed by the

LEVEL A AQUIFER PROTECTION AREA
Town of North Stonington -1- Aquifer Protection Regulations
1.0 TITLE AND AUTHORITY
1.1 Aquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public drinking water for the State of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will increase as the population grows and opportunities for new surface water supplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and increasingly intense development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have been contaminated by certain land use activities, and others are now threatened. To address this problem, Connecticut has established the Aquifer Protection Area Program (Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb) to identify critical water supply aquifers and to protect them from pollution by managing land use. Protection requires coordinated responsibilities shared by the state, municipality and water companies to ensure a plentiful supply of public drinking water for present and future generations. It is therefore the purpose of these regulations to protect aquifer protection areas within the Town of North Stonington by making provisions for:
A. implementing regulations consistent with state regulations and An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb (the Act);
B. delineating aquifer protection areas on the Town zoning or inland wetland and watercourse areas maps;
C. regulating land use activity within the aquifer protection area including: prohibiting certain new activities; registering existing regulated activities; and issuing permits for new regulated activities at registered facilities; and
D. administering and enforcing these regulations.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the Aquifer Protection Area Regulations (the "APA Regulations") of the Town of North Stonington.
1.3 These regulations were adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of §22a-354p of An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, the Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb and the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies §22a-354i-1 through §22a-354i-10.
1.4 The Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of North Stonington is established as the Aquifer Protection Agency (the "Agency") in accordance with the "Ordinance for the Establishment of an Aquifer Protection Agency," (the "APA Ordinance") effective May 24, 2010, and shall implement the purposes and provisions of the APA Ordinance and the Act.
1.5 The Agency shall administer all provisions of the Act and shall approve or deny registrations, issue permits, issue permits with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in aquifer protection areas in the Town of North Stonington pursuant to the Act.
