Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code
and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other
subdivision numbers;
Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this
article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting
section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections
of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance
sections inserted in the Code; but, in no case shall the codifier make any change in the

by a fine not exceeding $100. Each day any such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate
offense and shall be punishable as such.
Sec. 1-9. Conflict of provisions.
If the provisions of different chapters of this Code conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions
of each chapter shall prevail as to all matters and questions growing out of the subject of such chapter.
If conflict shall continue after the application of the aforesaid rule, the provisions which shall have the
higher standard or the more severe penalty or, failing these, the most recent date of passage, shall
prevail.
Sec. 1-10. Availability of Code and amendments.
A copy of this Code shall be kept on file in the office of the Town Clerk. It shall be the duty of the Town
Clerk to insert in their designated places all amendments when the same have been printed or
reprinted in page form and to extract from such Code all provisions which may be from time to time

place from other ordinances, laws or regulations.

clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or
section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by the valid judgment or

Sec. 2-63. Admission of liability.
[Ord. No. 06-03, § 4, 11-20-2006]
If the person who is sent notice pursuant to this article wishes to admit liability for any alleged violation,
he may, without requesting a hearing, pay the full amount of the fines, penalties, costs or fees admitted
to in person or by mail to an official designated by the Town, city or borough. Such payment shall be
inadmissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, to establish the conduct of such person or other
person making the payment. Any person who does not deliver or mail written demand for a hearing
within 10 days of the date of the first notice provided for in Section 2-62 shall be deemed to have
admitted liability, and the Town Manager, or his designee, shall certify such person's failure to respond
to the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall thereupon enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs
or fees provided for by the applicable ordinances and shall follow the procedures set forth herein.
Sec. 2-64. Request for hearing.
[Ord. No. 06-03, § 5, 11-20-2006]
Any person who requests a hearing shall be given written notice of the date, time and place for the
hearing. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days from the date of the
mailing of notice, provided the hearing officer shall grant upon good cause shown any reasonable
request by any interested party for postponement or continuance. An original or certified copy of the
initial notice of violation issued by a police officer or other issuing officer shall be filed and retained by
the Town, city or borough, be deemed to be a business record within the scope of Connecticut General
Statutes Section 52-180 and be evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the police
officer or issuing officer shall be required at the hearing if such person so requests. A person wishing
to contest his liability shall appear at the hearing and may present evidence in his behalf. A designated
Town official, other than the hearing officer, may present evidence on behalf of the Town. If such
person fails to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against him upon a
finding of proper notice and liability under the applicable statutes or ordinances. The hearing officer
may accept from such person copies of police reports, Department of Motor Vehicles documents and
other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person is
unnecessary. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such
methods of proof as he deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence
shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. The hearing
officer shall announce his decision at the end of the hearing. If he determines that the person is not
liable, he shall dismiss the matter and enter his determination in writing accordingly. If he determines
that the person is liable for the violation, he shall forthwith enter and assess the fines, penalties, costs
or fees against such person as provided by the applicable ordinances of the Town.
Sec. 2-65. Court enforcement.
[Ord. No. 06-03, § 6, 11-20-2006]

a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than 30 days nor more
than 12 months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment with the clerk of a
superior court facility designated by the chief court administrator together with an entry fee of $8. The
certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment. Within such twelvemonth

enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
Any alteration of a "historic" structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
VARIANCE
A grant of relief by the community from the terms of the floodplain management regulations.
VIOLATION
Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain
management ordinance or any requirements or conditions of a permit. A structure or other
development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, flood-proofing
certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided to the Town Engineer.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION
The height, in relation to the National American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum,
where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.

The purpose of this article is to promote public health, safety, and general welfare within the Town, to
minimize flood losses in floodway and flood fringe areas in the Town, and to protect the aquifer within
said areas by:
Restricting, prohibiting, or controlling uses, including, but not limited to, deposit, removal or
storage of materials, construction of structures or buildings, and any other works which:
Are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood,
Cause increases in flood heights or velocities, or
Are likely to pollute groundwaters;
Requiring that permitted uses vulnerable to flood, including public facilities, shall be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction, thereby reducing damage due to flooding,
and the need for investment in flood control projects;
Insuring that potential buyers will have the opportunity of identifying land within the flood hazard
area;
Minimizing surface and groundwater pollution which will affect human, animal, or plant life;
Helping to maintain a stable tax base through the preservation of property values by reducing the
potential of future flood blight areas;
Providing for public awareness of the potential for flooding, and harm to the aquifer; and
Protecting the aquifer for use as a public water supply, by limiting the amount of impervious
surface within the floodplain area, and reducing the effect of deicing salts, chemicals and other
pollutants.

applicant must also provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained;
A statement and supporting documentation (all costs of project, market value of
structures, etc.) verifying that the proposed alterations to an existing structure meet or do
not meet the criteria of the substantial improvement and/or substantial damage definition.
If a development meets the definition of substantial improvement and/or substantial
damage, the structure must be brought into compliance with all floodplain regulations as
if it was new construction;
Where applicable the following certifications by a Connecticut registered engineer or
architect are required, and must be provided to the Town Engineer. The design and
methods of construction must be certified to be in accordance with accepted standards of
practice and with the provisions of Section 3-42:
Non-residential flood-proofing must meet the provisions of Section 3-42;
Fully enclosed areas below the base flood elevation (BFE) must meet the minimum
design criteria in Section 3-42;
No (0.00 foot) increase in floodway water surface elevations is allowed. Any
development in a floodway must meet the provisions of Section 3-42.
Incremental improvements. The area of the site covered by a proposed improvement,
addition, or accessory structure, shall be no more than 25% of the area of the site
covered by the existing building or buildings of principal use, as long as the pertinent
requirements of this article are met. The applicant for a permit to extend improvements,
additions or accessory structures into the flood fringe areas may apply for approval for
such extension in increments. In addition to the other requirements of Section 3-39, the
applicant shall provide a table as part of its special exception application containing the
following baseline information:
The "baseline amount" which shall be the number of square feet in the area of the
site covered by the footprints of the existing building or buildings of principal use at
the time of the first special exception application under this subsection. Said
"baseline amount" shall not include the square footage of any existing improvement,
addition or accessory structure on the site that has previously been approved under
this article as a special exception allowing such existing improvement, addition or
accessory structure to extend into a flood fringe area.
The "maximum encroachment amount" which shall be and shall not exceed the
number which is 25% of the baseline amount at the date of the first development
permit application.
The "proposed encroachment amount" which shall be the square footage of the
proposed improvements, additions or accessory structures that are proposed to
extend into the flood fringe area.
The "remaining maximum encroachment amount" which shall be the difference in
square footage, if any, obtained by subtracting C from B.
Thereafter, and so long as any amount of said remaining maximum encroachment
amount exists, and the proposed extension meets all the other requirements of this
article, the applicant may apply to use all or a portion of such remaining maximum
encroachment amount, as it may be reduced from time to time, in connection with
future improvements, additions or accessory structures.

state, federal, or municipal government. In no case, however, will any such activity be allowed if an
increase in flood levels within the community results.
Substantial improvements or additions to existing structures or accessory structures, or fill shall be
permitted only as a special exception in the flood fringe areas, and when authorized by the Town
Engineer, and shall conform to the provisions of these regulations, provided the following provisions
are flood hazard reduction are met.
Prior to any development activities, application for a floodplain development permit shall be made to
the Town Engineer on forms provided and shall meet the requirements of Section 3-39.
General standards. In all special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) the following provisions are required:
Substantial improvements, additions, and accessory structures that have sustained
substantial damage shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
Substantial improvements, additions, and accessory structures that have sustained
substantial damage shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.
Substantial improvements and repairs to structures that have sustained substantial damage
shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Substantial improvements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage
cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water.
Electrical, heating, ventilation plumbing, air conditioning equipment, HVAC ductwork, and
other service facilities, or any machinery or utility equipment or connections servicing a
structure shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE) to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This includes,
but is not limited to, furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water
heaters, ventilation ductwork, washer and dryer hookups, electrical junction boxes, and circuit
breaker boxes.
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the system into floodwaters.
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them
or contamination from them during flooding.
Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) that are located outside or inside of the
structure must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or
be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the
top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for
the infiltration of floodwater.
In any portion of a watercourse that is altered or relocated, the flood carrying capacity must
be maintained. Notify adjacent communities and the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP), Inland Water Resources Division prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse.
If any portion of a structure lies within the special flood hazard area (SFHA), the entire
structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction
requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages,

decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that
extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards
of the more restrictive zone.
If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the construction standards of the most
restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e. V zone is more restrictive that A zone;
structure must be built to the highest BFE). The structure includes any attached additions,
garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or
porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the
requirements of the more restrictive zone.
Compensatory storage. The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas
which are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling or
substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure, shall be
compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided
on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be
provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage;
it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of
floodwater at each elevation, up to and including the one-hundred-year flood elevation, which
would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an
unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory
storage can be provided off-site if approved by the Town Engineer.
Equal conveyance. Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as
designated on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments
resulting from filling or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the
structure, are prohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered
professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall
not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the
floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory
storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood storage or
flood velocity.
In the event that elimination of a structure takes place, by reason of fire or other catastrophe,
replacement with a structure of like kind and intended use will be allowed to the extent that
the building coverage will not exceed 125% of the displaced building coverage, to the extent
that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or regulation, as long as all requirements
of Sections 3-39 and 3-42 are met.
Standards for watercourses without established base flood elevations (un-numbered A Zone),
adopted floodways and/or flood mapping.
The Town Engineer shall require base flood elevation (BFE) data be provided with any
application for substantial improvement, repair to structures which have sustained damage or
other development in Zone A without a FEMA-published BFE (un-numbered A Zone). The
Town Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any BFE and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data developed for subdivision
proposals, as criteria for requiring that substantial improvements, repair to structures which
have sustained substantial damage or other development in un-numbered A Zones on the
community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) meet the standards in Sections 3-39 and 3-
42(1). If no BFE can be determined, the lowest floor, including basement, must be elevated to
two feet above the highest adjacent grade next to the structure.
When BFEs have been determined within Zones A1-A30 and AE on the community's FIRM
but a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Town Engineer must require that no
substantial improvements, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or
other development, including fill, shall be permitted which will increase the water surface

elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community when all
existing and anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed
development.
The Town Engineer may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses without
FEMA-published floodways. When such data of an applicant or whenever such data is
available from any other source (in response to the municipality's request or not), the
community shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be
able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation
more than one foot at any point within the community.
The Town Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any BFE and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, as criteria for requiring that substantial
improvements, repair to structures which have sustained substantial damage or other
development in any area of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding within the community
meet the standards in Sections 3-39 and 3-42(1).
Specific standards.
Construction standards in special flood hazard areas (SFHA), Zones A, A1-A30, AE.
Residential construction. All substantial improvements and repair to structures that have
sustained substantial damage which are residential structures shall have the bottom of
the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE).
Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the structure must
be elevated to or above the BFE.
Non-residential construction. All substantial improvements and repair to structures that
have sustained substantial damage which are commercial, industrial or non-residential
structures shall have:
The bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base
flood elevation (BFE); or
In lieu of being elevated, non-residential structures may be dry flood-proofed to one
foot above the BFE provided that together with all attendant utilities and sanitary
facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and provided that such
structures are composed of structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic ad hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Connecticut
registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural
design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design
and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice
for meeting the provisions of this section. Such certification shall be provided to the
Town Engineer on the FEMA Floodproofing Certificate, Form 81-65.
Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that service the structure
must be elevated to or above the BFE.
Fully enclosed areas below the base flood elevation of elevated buildings. All substantial
improvements or repair of substantial damage to residential or non-residential structures
that include fully enclosed areas formed by a foundation and other exterior walls below
the base flood elevation (BFE) of an elevated building, shall be designed to preclude
finished living space and be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls (wet flood-proofing).
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a Connecticut
registered professional engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria listed
in Sections A. through G. below:

Provide a minimum of two openings (hydraulic flood vents) having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. These hydraulic openings must be located on at least two different walls.
Only the area (square footage) that lies below the BFE can be used in the
calculation of net area of vents required. If the structure has more than one enclosed
area, openings must be installed in the exterior walls of each enclosed area so that
floodwaters can enter directly from the outside;
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. At least
one side of the structure's fully enclosed area must be at or above grade. Fill placed
around the foundation walls must be graded so that the elevation inside the enclosed
area is equal to or higher than the adjacent outside elevation on at least one side of
the building. The finished floor of the enclosed area shall be no lower than the
bottom of the foundation openings. The foundation slab of a residential structure,
including the slab of a crawlspace, must be set equal to the outside finished grade
on at least one side of the building;
The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or
devices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in both
directions without any external influence or control such as human intervention,
including the use of electrical and other non-automatic mechanical means. Other
coverings may be designed and certified by an engineer registered in the State of
Connecticut or approved by the Town Engineer;
The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the enclosed area shall be
the minimum necessary and shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, building
access or limited storage. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for the parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior
door) or entry to living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not be
used for human habitation or partitioned into separate rooms;
All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the BFE shall be
unfinished and resistant to flood damage;
Electrical, plumbing, HVAC ductwork, machinery or other utility equipment and
connections that service the structure (including, but not limited to, furnaces, oil or
propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation, washers,
dryer, electrical junction boxes, circuit breaker boxes and food freezers) are
prohibited in the fully enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the space,
will subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates; and
A residential building with a structurally attached garage having the floor slab below
the BFE is considered an enclosed area below the BFE and must meet the
standards of Section 3-42(3)A through G. A garage attached to a residential
structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to
allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in both directions. Flood
openings or vents are required in the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage
doors. Human intervention necessary to open garage doors when flooding occurs is
not an acceptable means of meeting the openings requirements. In addition to the
automatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below the BFE must be
constructed with flood resistant materials. Garages attached to non-residential
structures must also meet the aforementioned requirements or be dry flood-proofed
as per the requirements of Section 3-42(3)a.2.
Recreational vehicles (RVs). Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall be:
On the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, AND

Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect
type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
Floodways. Located within special flood hazard areas (SFHA) are areas designated as
floodway on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps (FBFM). Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, no
encroachments, including fill, substantial improvements, repairs to substantially damaged
structures and other developments shall be permitted unless certification, with supporting
technical data, by a Connecticut licensed professional engineer is provided demonstrating
that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during
occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences in the floodway must be aligned with the flow
and be of an open design. A permit may be given which allows encroachments resulting in an
increase in base flood elevations provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway
revision by meeting the requirements of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Subsection 65.12.
Standards for development in areas of shallow flooding (Zones AO and AH). Located within
the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) are areas designated as shallow flooding areas (AO
and AH Zones). These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate. In AO and AH zones, the following provisions apply:
For residential structures, all substantial improvements and repair to structures that have
sustained substantial damage shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to the depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above
the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
basement, shall be elevated, at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
For non-residential structures, all substantial improvements and repair to structures that
have sustained substantial damage shall:
Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet above the highest adjacent grade.
If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be
elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely flood-proofed to
or above the depth number, in feet, specified on the FIRM above the highest
adjacent grade, or if no depth number is specified at least two feet above the highest
adjacent grade, so that any space below that level is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. Designs for complying with this requirement must be certified by either a
Connecticut licensed professional engineer or architect.
On-site drainage for all proposed structures in AO and AH Zones located on slopes
shall provide adequate drainage paths to guide floodwaters around and away from
such structures.

environmental remediation; elimination of blight conditions; brownfield redevelopment; transitoriented
development; and neighborhood or village revitalization.
The reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed in the National Registry of
Historical Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or any locally-adopted historic district
provided the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not result in the structure losing
its historical designation.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure
will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation
(BFE) and the elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation.
Variances to this article allowing construction within the special flood hazard areas shall not be
issued if the granting of such variance would result in increased flood heights and velocities,
increased or additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances,
create fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
If a variance is issued to construct a principal structure and/or accessory structure within the flood
fringe area, construction standards described in Sections 3-39 and 3-42 must be met.
If a variance is issued to construct a principal structure and/or accessory structure within the flood
fringe area, increased premium rates for flood insurance will result as such construction within the
flood fringe area increases risk to life and property.
Applications for a variance shall be made to the Town Engineer, on forms provided by the Town
Engineer, and all data supplied shall be certified to be substantially correct and a true
representation of existing conditions by a professional engineer registered in the State of
Connecticut.

The Town Manager is hereby authorized and directed to determine the condition of dwellings,
dwelling units, rooming units, and premises located within the Town, in order to perform such
officer's duty of safeguarding the health and safety of the occupants of dwellings and of the
general public. For the purpose of making such inspections the Town Manager is hereby
authorized to enter, examine, and survey at all reasonable times all dwellings, dwelling units,
rooming units and premises.
The owner or occupant of every dwelling, dwelling unit, and rooming unit, or the person in charge
thereof, shall give the Town Manager free access to such dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit
and its premises, at all reasonable times for the purpose of such inspection, examination and
survey.
Such inspection, examination or survey shall not have for its purpose the undue harassment of
said owner or occupant, and such inspection, examination or survey shall be made so as to cause
the least amount of inconvenience to said owner or occupant consistent with an efficient
performance of the duties of the Town Manager.
To ensure further that the policy of this article, which is to achieve compliance through cooperation
of owners and occupants, be successfully maintained, it shall be the practice of the Town Manager
whenever practicable, to provide reasonable advance notice to owners and/or occupants of
projected blanket inspection or inspections of a routine nature.
Whenever an owner, occupant or person in charge of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or
premises shall deny the Town Manager right of entry for the purpose of inspection, examination or
survey, the Town Manager shall not so enter until such officer presents a duly issued search
warrant, describing the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises, to the owner, occupant or
person in charge thereof.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the entry of the Town Manager at any time,
when, in such officer's judgment, an emergency tending to create an immediate danger to the
public health, welfare or safety exists, or when such entry is requested by the owner, occupant or
person in charge of the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises, or when the Town
Manager presents a duly issued search warrant to said owner, occupant or person in charge
thereof.
Each occupant of a dwelling or dwelling unit shall give the owner thereof, or the owner's agent or
employee, access to any part of such dwelling or dwelling unit or its premises, at all reasonable

units located on premises where more than two dwelling units share the same premises.
Every owner of a multiple dwelling who lets any dwelling unit to the public shall equip every

dwelling in a rodentproof or reasonably insectproof condition, extermination shall be the
responsibility of the owner.
Whenever infestation exists in two or more of the dwelling units in any dwelling, or in the
shared or public parts of any dwelling containing two or more dwelling units, extermination

Municipalities in the State of Connecticut are required to comply with a number of both state and
federal laws, regulations and permits which require a municipality to address the impacts of
construction and post-development stormwater runoff quality and non-point source pollution.
Therefore, the Town of Windsor has established this set of stormwater management policies to
provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the
purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the
public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and
minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and
sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with postdevelopment
stormwater runoff.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety,
environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control
the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source
pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that
proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize the damage to public
and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and
general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources.

[Ord. No. 09-01, 1-20-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater
management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage
stormwater by an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property
legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of
stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by
on-site practices and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and
maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be
implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage
channels from the site to the off-site facility.
Sec. 3-155. Post-development stormwater management
performance criteria.
[Ord. No. 09-01, 1-20-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless
otherwise provided for in this article:
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before
discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this
requirement if:
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in
the Connecticut Guidelines for Stormwater Quality Management;
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or non-structural practices are selected, designed,
constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Connecticut
Guidelines for Stormwater Quality Management; and
Runoff from "establishments" (as defined in Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-134) is
adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater
controls, non-structural practices and pollution prevention practices.
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and
degradation shall be provided by using all of the following approaches:
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream
buffer;
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage for the one year, twenty-four-hour return
frequency storm event; and
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be
provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the predevelopment
rate for the fifty-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the
one year, twenty-four-hour storm under subsection (b) is exempted, then peak discharge rate
attenuation of the two-year through twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be
provided.
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by
controlling and safely conveying the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm

event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
Drainage system guidelines. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and
designed using the appropriate criteria from the Connecticut Guidelines for Stormwater Quality
Management.
The requirements in subsection (c) and (d) may be adjusted or waived by the Town Engineer for
sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled postdevelopment
conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the
requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled postdevelopment
conditions.
Sec. 3-156. Construction inspections of post-development
stormwater management systems.
[Ord. No. 09-01, 1-20-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater
management system construction shall be conducted by the Town Engineer or conducted and
certified by a professional engineer who has been approved by the Town Engineer. Construction
inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management plan for establishing compliance.
Final inspection and as-built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of
occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is
in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to
submit actual "as-built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final
construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater
management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final
inspection by the Town Engineer is required before the release of any performance securities can
occur.
Sec. 3-157. On-going inspection and maintenance of stormwater
facilities and practices.
[Ord. No. 09-01, 1-20-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
Long-term maintenance inspection of stormwater facilities and practices. A stormwater
management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in
accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement. In the event that the
stormwater management facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public
safety or public health, the Town Engineer shall notify the person responsible for carrying out the
maintenance plan by registered or certified mail to the person in the inspection and maintenance
agreement. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the
plan and shall specify the time within which measures shall be completed. If the responsible
person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement,
the Town Engineer may correct the violation as provided in subsection (d) hereof.
Right-of-entry for inspection. The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall
provide for the Town Engineer to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable
manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when the Town
Engineer has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has
occurred and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a
violation of this article.

Sec. 3-169. Discharge prohibitions.
[Ord. No. 09-03, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the
municipal storm drainage system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to
pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable
water quality standards, other than stormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drainage system is prohibited except as described below:
The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article:
Naturally occurring discharges such as rising groundwaters, uncontaminated
groundwater infiltration (as defined at 40 CFR 35.2005(20)), springs, diverted stream
flows, and natural riparian habitat or wetland flows;

prior to the time of the test.
The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES
permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the
authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency or CT DEP, provided that the
discharge is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drainage system.
Prohibition of illegal connections.
The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm

Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The Town Engineer may, without
prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the
United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
Town Engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge.
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Town Engineer
will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition
the Town Engineer for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the Town Engineer.
Sec. 3-171. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
[Ord. No. 09-03, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a
form acceptable to the Town Engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
Sec. 3-172. Monitoring of damages.
[Ord. No. 09-03, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
Applicability. This section applies to all premises that have stormwater discharges associated with
industrial and/or construction activities.
Access to premises.
The Town Engineer shall be permitted to enter and inspect premises subject to regulation
under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a
discharge has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the Town Engineer.
Persons shall allow the Town Engineer ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
The Town Engineer shall have the right to set up on any premise such devices as are
necessary in the opinion of the Town Engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
premise's stormwater discharge.
The Town Engineer has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The premise's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices
used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the premise to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the person responsible for

maintaining the premise at the written or oral request of the Town Engineer and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the person responsible for
maintaining the premise.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town Engineer access to a premise is a violation of a
stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a premise
with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the Town Engineer reasonable access to the premise for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
If the Town Engineer has been refused access to any part of the premise from which
stormwater is discharged, and he is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this article; or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any
order issued hereunder; or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the Town Engineer may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
Sec. 3-173. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce
stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices.
[Ord. No. 09-03, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
The Town Engineer will implement requirements identifying best management practices for any activity,
operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the
storm drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drainage system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person
responsible for a property or premise which is or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to
prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance
with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the
provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with the requirements of the NPDES permit.
Sec. 3-174. Watercourse protection.
[Ord. No. 09-03, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property tree of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned
structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the
use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
Sec. 3-175. Notification of spills.
[Ord. No. 09-03, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or
operation has information of any known, or suspected release of materials which, are resulting or may
result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or
waters of the United States; said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,

person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence. Additionally, in the
event of a release of hazardous and/or non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Town
Engineer in person or by phone no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Town Engineer within three
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from commercial
or industrial activities, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written
record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained
for at least three years.
Sec. 3-176. Enforcement.
[Ord. No. 09-03, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 09-07, 9-8-2009]

failed to meet a requirement of this article he shall order compliance by written notice of violation
to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
The elimination of illicit discharges or connections;

Sec. 6-9. Where water supply required.
An approved water supply capable of supplying the required fire flow for fire protection shall be
provided to all premises upon which facilities, buildings, or portions of buildings are hereafter
constructed or moved into the jurisdiction. Where available, a municipal water supply shall be utilized.
Where municipal water is available, fire hydrants shall be installed at the developer's expense.

exceed 500 feet, unless greater space between hydrants is approved by the Fire Marshal.
For all other occupancies, hydrants shall be placed at intervals not to exceed 250 feet, unless
a greater space between hydrants is approved by the Fire Marshal.
Private fire service mains and appurtenances shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 24.
Water tanks for private fire protection may be required in buildings where the municipal water
supply is insufficient to meet the required fire flow and shall be installed in accordance with NFPA
22.
Buildings equipped with a Fire Department connection installed in accordance with the State
Building Code and Connecticut State Fire Safety Code shall have a hydrant within 100 feet of the
Fire Department connections.
Exception: The distance shall be permitted to exceed 100 feet where approved by the Fire
Marshal.
Where no adequate or reliable municipal water distribution system exists to provide adequate fire
protection, all buildings shall be protected throughout by an automatic sprinkler system with stored
water, to be installed in accordance with the applicable codes.
Sec. 6-10. Installation of new fire hydrants; notice of public
hearing.
Whenever the Town Manager shall determine that public convenience and interest require the
installation of any new fire hydrant, such Director shall notify the Council, which shall thereupon hold a
public hearing. Notice of such hearing shall be given by publication and by notice sent by mail to all
record owners of property located within such distances in any direction from the proposed hydrant
location which shall be benefitted.
Sec. 6-11. Assessment of costs of hydrant installation.
In the event that the Council shall determine that public convenience and necessity require the
installation of such hydrant, the Council shall thereupon instruct the Town Manager to contract with the
Water Bureau of the Metropolitan District for the installation of said hydrant and shall assess so much
of the cost of the installation of said hydrant as the Council deems necessary and proper equitably
among the owners of property which shall be benefitted by said hydrant, having in mind the nature and
use of the land and the state of improvement thereof. At all such hearings, the Council may receive
and consider the testimony of expert appraisers.

determined, and the same shall be a lien upon the premises of such owner, provided that the Town
Manager shall cause a certificate of lien to be recorded in the Town Clerk's office within 60 days from

the assessment, together with fees and charges, is fully paid, and may be foreclosed in the same
manner as tax liens; and the Town shall not be required to file for record any further certificate of such
lien.
Sec. 6-13. Deferment of hydrant assessment.

If the deferment request is approved by Council, the amount of the deferment plus interest at
the same rate as delinquent property taxes will be secured by placing a lien against the
property for which the deferment was granted.
The deferred assessment and interest will be due and payable whenever the land is sold,
subdivided, or built upon. Upon payment in full of the amount due, the lien shall be released
by the Town.

containers subscribed by the customer for collection. The price structure shall be unit-based to
encourage customer's reduction in refuse requiring removal, while maximizing the amount of
recyclables separated for collection. The collector shall determine a single standardized refuse
collection container size, and establish a standardized price to be charged for the disposal of this
base volume. Should a residential customer desire a container that is of a different size than the
standard size, then the collector shall provide such a container, for which the collector may charge
a different amount than the standardized price for disposal of the refuse by the customer. Lesser
amounts shall be charged for smaller containers, with higher amounts being charged for servicing
containers larger than the standard. The collector shall offer and advertise a minimum of two
container sizes to residential customers.
Collectors may establish rules and regulations regarding the safe maximum weight of the contents
of approved containers. A collector may refuse to collect any approved container which is
overloaded or which contains a volume of refuse or solid waste greater than the rated or specified
volume of such container. The collector may also determine to account for and bill the customer
for the collection of such excess refuse or solid waste.
In the event the collector elects to perform collection of materials provided for in this chapter
through subcontractors or agents, such agency relationship shall not relieve the collector of
responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation
promulgated hereunder.
Nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit licensed collectors from charging additional fees for
providing services in addition to refuse collection and disposal. These services may include bulky
waste, yard waste, and land-clearing debris collection and disposal.
No person or collector shall receive, dispose of, transport, or process solid waste, refuse or
recyclable materials at any solid waste facility, volume reduction plant, solid waste disposal area,
recycling facility or composting facility unless such facility complies with the provisions of C.G.S.
§ 22a-208a, or the provisions of a permit issued by another state.
When a collector delivers solid waste, refuse or recyclable materials to a facility that has obtained
a permit or authorization from the state, then, upon delivery, such collector shall identify to the
receiving facility for each load of such materials from Windsor that the materials originated from
the Town.
Any person, other than a collector, who dumps more than one cubic foot in volume of solid waste
in a refuse collection container without the authorization of the owner of such container, or dumps
any material into a recycling collection container used to collect another type of material for
purposes of disposal by a collector shall be guilty of an infraction.
Every customer who generates solid waste and/or refuse from a business or multifamily dwelling
shall make provision for and cause the separation of recyclable materials from other solid waste
through the use of separate collection containers for the designated items versus the containers
for solid waste and refuse.
Each contract between a licensed collector and a customer from a business or multifamily dwelling
for the collection of solid waste shall make provision for the collection of recyclable materials,
either by providing for the collection of the recyclable materials by the same collector who is a
party to the solid waste contract, or by including an identification by the customer of the collector
with whom the recyclable materials collection contract exists. The provisions of this section shall
not be construed to require a customer to contract exclusively with one collector for the collection
of both the recyclable materials and solid waste. Each collector shall provide each customer with
clear written and/or pictorial instructions on how to separate the recyclable materials in
accordance with the provisions of C.G.S. § 22a-241(b).
Collectors that collect solid waste, refuse and/or recyclable materials from multifamily or business
customers shall offer such services with a frequency as is necessary to prevent overflow from the

Article VII. Adult-Oriented Establishments
Sec. 11-110. Findings and purpose.
[Ord. No. 96-1, § 1, 2-20-1996]
The Town Council of the Town of Windsor, Connecticut, finds:
There are a number of "adult-oriented establishments" located in towns in the United States which
require special supervision from the towns' public safety agencies in order to protect and preserve
the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishments, as well as the health, safety
and welfare of the towns' citizens.
Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States
indicate that:
Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such "adult-oriented establishments,"
especially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studies and rooms for the private
viewing of so-called "adult" motion pictures and/or video tapes and/or live entertainment;

Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons, clients or
customers of such "adult-oriented establishments" for the purpose of engaging in certain
sexual acts;
Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to
provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such
booths, cubicles and rooms;
Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of
such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles,
studios and rooms are in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and
rooms to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes and/or with other members of the
same sex, thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the Commission of sexual
acts which cause blood, semen and urine to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such
booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and
safety of other persons who may come into contact with such deposits; and
The reasonable regulation and supervision of such "adult-oriented establishments" tends to
discourage such sexual acts and prostitution, and thereby promotes the health, safety and
welfare of the patrons, clients and customers of such establishments.
The Appellate Court in Connecticut has found that establishments which feature female topless
dancers have a higher rate of public disturbance (fights, prostitution, public indecency) than those
that do not offer such entertainment (Dryden v. Department of Liquor Control, 15 Conn. App. 455,
464 (1987)).
The unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments including, without limitation, those
specifically cited at paragraph (a) hereof, is and would be detrimental to the general welfare,
health and safety of the citizens of Windsor.
The Constitution and laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the Town powers, especially police
power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise "adult-oriented
establishments" as hereinafter defined in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
It is not the intent of the Council, in enacting this article, to deny to any person rights to speech
protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions, nor is it the intent of the Council to
impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented films, video-tapes, books and/or other materials. Further, by enacting
this article, the Council does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain and/or
view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States and/or state constitutions, nor
does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors
of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such materials. This
article further has no applicability to any place or location to which a constitutional right of privacy
shall be applicable.

ARTICLE V. Newsracks
Sec. 15-70. Intent and purpose.
[Ord. No. 07-01, § 1, 3-19-2007]
Findings.
The uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in public rights-of-way presents
an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons entering and leaving
vehicles and buildings, and persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency
services.
Newsracks so located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public rightsof-
way, and unsightly newsracks located therein, constitute public nuisances.
It is a matter of public necessity that the Town protect children and non-consenting adults in
and on its public streets, sidewalks, transportation facilities and other public rights-of-way
from viewing public displays of offensive sexual material. Such displays are thrust
indiscriminately upon unwilling audiences of adults and children and constitute assaults upon
individual privacy.
These factors constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of
public rights-of-way, constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, are injurious to
health, offensive to the sense, and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of property
as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community.
The Council recognizes, however, that the use of such rights-of-way is so historically
associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to those
areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The interests require a reasonable
accommodation which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this article
which is designed to accommodate such interests regulating the time, place and manner of
using such newsracks.
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide uniform guidelines for and to regulate the
installation, operation and maintenance of newsracks in public rights-of-way in the Town so that
such newsracks shall not unduly obstruct sidewalks, interfere with the public's right to
unhampered passage therein, create traffic congestion or illegal parking or stopping by motorist in
order to purchase newspapers, damage municipal property because of the chaining of newsracks
to poles, traffic standards, trees or other fixtures, interfere with the performance of municipal
services, create unsightly conditions and endanger the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the
Town so as to:
Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience;
Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including
ingress to, or egress from, any place of business or from the street to the sidewalk;
Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic
signs and signals, hydrants, mailboxes, and similar appurtenances, and access to locations
used for public transportation purposes;
Reduce visual blight on the public rights-of-way, protect the aesthetics and value of
surrounding properties, and protect the quiet of residential areas;
Reduce exposure of the Town to personal injury of property damage claims and litigation; and

PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
These Regulations are adopted and may be amended from time to time
under authority of Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statutes for
the purposes of promoting the health, safety, morals and general welfare
of the community; reducing traffic congestion in the streets; ensuring
adequate light and air; preventing the overcrowding of land; avoiding
excessive concentration of population; facilitating adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public
requirements; and conserving the value of property and encouraging the
most appropriate use of the land, based on its suitability for particular
uses and structures, with reasonable consideration for the character and
property values of the area, in accordance with the adopted Plan of
Conservation and Development. These Regulations are intended to
provide the Town Planning and Zoning Commission the authority to give
reasonable consideration for the protection of historic factors in its
evaluations and decisions.

Interpretation of Boundaries
In interpreting the boundaries of districts as shown on the Zoning Map,
the following rules shall apply:
boundaries abutting street or highway right-of-way lines shall extend to
the centerline of such streets or highways;
boundaries following railroad lines shall be interpreted as midway
between the main track(s);
boundaries following shorelines shall move with natural changes in the
shore line and boundaries following streams, rivers or other linear bodies
of water shall follow their centerlines;
in cases of uncertainty, the Commission shall determine the location of
the boundary;
in the case of a lot, separately described in the latest deed of record prior
to the effective date of these Regulations, situated in more than one
zone, the Commission may allow the provisions of either zone to be
applied into the other zone for a distance not to exceed 20 feet without
the requirement for a zone change public hearing if it finds that doing so
will improve the proposed development and not negatively impact
surrounding properties; and
in cases where the standards or requirements applicable to a zone shown
on the Official Zoning Map have been deleted from these Regulations,
the Commission shall determine the most appropriate standards.
ZONING REGULATIONS

except in conformity with the provisions of these Regulations.
No height, coverage, or other maximum requirement shall be increased,
except in conformity with the provisions of these Regulations.

underground irrigation system shall be installed in landscaped areas
primarily visible from the street for developments greater than one acre
involving a new building(s) or addition(s) that more than doubles the
existing floor area. The Commission may waive this requirement during
its review of a site plan application if it finds that the unique soil
composition, drainage characteristics, and/or proposed plant species do
not require irrigation to survive.
Specific Landscaping Requirements
Required Buffer Strips
In order to provide additional screening and separation between
potentially incompatible uses, planted buffer strips of the indicated width
shall be provided on the following zoned properties when their
development occurs adjacent to any residential or AG Zone, or any NZ
Zone when used for purposes that the Commission determines are
incompatible:
Business and Professional Zones: 20 feet
Restricted Commercial Zone: 50 feet
Industrial and Warehouse Zones: 50 feet

OUTDOOR LIGHTING
In order to maximize the effectiveness of site lighting, avoid unnecessary
upward illumination, prevent light trespass onto adjacent properties, and
to reduce glare, the following outdoor lighting standards shall apply.
3.2.1 General Requirements
A
Lighting for new site plans and applicable design developments shall
comply with these regulations. Cumulatively changing more than 25% of
the luminaires; their mounting heights; or their location on an existing
site plan or design development after May 11, 2016 requires a site plan
or detailed plan modification with a photometric plan to determine that
such changes do not increase any non-conformity.
Any aforementioned changes up to 25%, or changes to sites that have
five outdoor light fixtures or fewer, shall provide sufficient detail for the
Town Planner and Zoning Enforcement Officer to jointly determine that
such changes comply with all applicable regulations and will not increase
any non-conformity, which may require a photometric plan in accordance
with Section 3.2.4B at the Town Planner and Zoning Enforcement
Officer’s discretion, depending on the sensitivity of adjacent land and the
degree of difficulty in evaluating potential light trespass and/or glare.

The maximum mounting height of any luminaire shall be 24 feet from the
average surrounding grade in all zones, except that the Commission, by a
two-thirds vote, may increase the maximum height of luminaires if the
Commission finds that:
(1) the unique nature of the facility (such as an outdoor recreational
facility) requires higher lighting supports to achieve acceptable
light levels within the illuminated area;
(2) the luminaires comply with the maximum allowable BUG ratings
found in Section 3.2.2;
(3) the combination of height and/or topography will not create an
objectionable direct glare source from adjacent properties or
more distant residential areas (site sections may be required to
determine compliance);
(4) the applicant must request the height increase in writing at the
time of application; and
(5) a report and plan indicating actual results from the lighting
installation shall be provided to the Zoning Enforcement Officer
by the applicant to ensure compliance with these regulations.
C
Light poles within parking lots shall be located within curbed landscaped
islands and their foundations recessed at least three feet from any curb
to avoid potential contact with vehicles (see Appendix 1, page 15).
Foundations for all light poles shall not exceed six inches above the
average surrounding grade.
D
All wiring shall be placed underground as per Section 14.1.15
E
Canopy lighting (e.g., beneath a fuel filling station canopy or a portecochere)
shall be recessed or flush with the underside of the canopy.
F
Floodlighting is prohibited. Wall-packs, external sign lighting, and
architectural lighting shall be shielded to limit light to the intended
surface and prevent glare and light trespass above the horizontal plane
of the top of the wall or sign surface being illuminated. Downward
architectural and sign lighting is encouraged wherever feasible.

**To be considered 'ideally oriented', the luminaire must be mounted with the backlight portion of
the light output oriented perpendicular and towards the property line of concern. Luminaires that
are not ideally oriented within two mounting heights of the property line of concern shall be
evaluated in accordance with Section 3.2.3B.
*** Any luminaire that cannot be mounted with its backlight perpendicular to any property line
within 2X the mounting heights of the luminaire location shall meet the reduced Allowed Glare Rating
in above table.
B
If BUG ratings are not available or luminaires within two mounting
heights of a property line are not ideally oriented, the performance of the
lighting plan or of any less than ideally oriented luminaires shall be
evaluated in accordance with Section 3.2.3B.
C
Unless obstructed by buildings, evergreen vegetation, or other visual
obstructions, when a site abuts a lower lighting zone, the BUG ratings, or
where applicable, the vertical illuminance at the property line, shall meet
the standards for the lower lighting zone.
3.2.3 Horizontal and Vertical Illuminance
Uniform site lighting in vehicle and pedestrian areas reduces the contrast
between bright and dark areas that can impair visibility and reduce
safety. Maintaining minimum levels of light and appropriate average
light levels throughout vehicle and pedestrian areas ensures uniform site
lighting. Controlling vertical illuminance at property boundaries reduces
light trespass and protects the enjoyment and use of neighboring
properties.
A
The following maintained horizontal illuminance recommendations,
measured in footcandles on the ground, shall be met to the extent
practical. Average and minimum footcandle estimates should be
calculated separately limited to the paved surfaces used exclusively by
vehicles and shared by vehicles and pedestrians to avoid zero footcandle
estimates off the pavement that will nullify the uniformity ratio (u-ratio)
due to division by zero. Relief from these recommendations may be
provided under Section 3.2.3C.

Recognizing that outdoor lighting design is a complex and inexact process
dependent upon a number of independent factors such as: the
availability of suitable landscaped areas or structures for installing
luminaires; the location of existing poles and/or mounting walls; the nonconforming
nature of existing lighting, which may be improved as a result
of proposed modifications; and the fact that strict adherence to the
above recommended maintained horizontal and vertical illuminance
levels may be impractical, the Town Planner and Zoning Enforcement
Officer may jointly allow for flexibility in the outdoor lighting plan,
provided that the applicant submits evidence to support the need for
flexibility and that the proposed lighting addresses any concerns to the
extent practical. If there is disagreement on any issue between the staff
and the applicant, the plan will be referred to the Commission for
consideration as a Site Plan Modification.
3.2.4 Lighting Plans
Site plans shall include lighting plans with the following information:
A
The following measures of maintained horizontal illuminance (in
footcandles) shall be calculated separately for both exclusive vehicle
areas (i.e. access drives and loading areas) and shared vehicle and/or

The design of off-street parking lots shall comply with the following
requirements and standards.
General Requirements
Whenever practical, parking lots in the required front yard area shall be
avoided, but in cases where Sections 3.1.2, 5.2.2B, 8.2.1, 14.2.4B(1), and
14.2.4B(2) apply, they shall be prohibited.
Required parking spaces shall be located either on the same lot with the
principal use or on other land owned or leased by the same owner or
tenant and within a radius of 1,000 feet of any part of the building that it
is intended to serve, provided that the remote parking is surplus to the
required parking for the remote site and remains available for the
duration of the intended use.
The use of land for access to, or for parking in connection with, a use shall
be accessory to and part of that use.
Except as provided for in Section 15.2.6, shared off-street parking
facilities between the two or more properties are allowed, provided that
there are sufficient parking spaces to meet the cumulative parking
requirements of all uses located on both properties.

(1) Recognizing the availability of mass transit and public parking,
the mixed-use nature, and the walkability of Windsor Center; to
create a more vital village environment and promote
reinvestment in and adaptive reuse of existing floor area in the
B-2 in Windsor Center and its Fringe Area, as depicted in the Plan
of Conservation and Development (see Appendix, page A-28):
changes in the use of existing gross floor area (build prior
to July 15, 2016) may be approved without the provision
of additional parking, as may otherwise be required; and
so as not to discourage the provision of additional
parking, any parking spaces added subsequent to the
adoption of this regulation shall be credited towards
potential new floor area on the subject property, which
floor area may be approved subsequent to the approval
of the parking spaces.
(2) Except as provided in (1) above, for residential and commercial
uses, and mixed-use developments utilizing existing floor area

described above;
the proposed site is located near on-street or other
public parking of a sufficient amount and within
reasonable proximity to justify the reduction; and/or
the proposed site is located within one-quarter mile of a

determine an appropriate standard based on surveys by the American
Planning Association, Institute of Transportation Engineers, or similar
organizations.
To minimize impervious surfaces as well as reduce stormwater runoff and
non-point pollution in parking lots of 50 or more spaces, the Commission
may require parking spaces in excess of the minimum requirements of
these regulations to be constructed with a pervious pavement system
approved by the Town Engineer. Where minimum parking requirements
exceed the needs of a particular establishment, after taking into account
the ability to defer parking under Section 3.3.1H(2), parking lots may also
be constructed with a pervious pavement system approved by the Town
Engineer.
Depending on the parking needs of a particular tenant, the Commission
may authorize a phased development of the off-street parking area in
compliance with the following criteria.
(1) The total number of spaces required to be shown on the site plan
shall be determined in accordance with the standards for the
proposed use(s).
(2) The construction of the parking area and installation of the
spaces may be phased according to short- and long-term needs
of the proposed use(s). Up to 50 percent of the total required
spaces may be deferred in reserve parking, except that for
buildings housing computer equipment and operations and
warehouse uses, this deferred percentage may be increased to
70 percent. This approval shall become invalid if the use changes.
(3) Spaces not intended for construction as part of the short term
shall be labeled "Reserve Parking" on the plan and shall be
properly designed and shown as an integral part of the overall
parking layout and must be located on land suitable for parking
area development.
(4) If at any time after the Certificate of Occupancy is issued the
Zoning Enforcement Officer determines that additional spaces
may be needed, he shall notify the Commission and the owner of
the property concerning his finding.

shown on the approved site plan as "Reserve Parking" be
constructed.
The provision of shared driveways, parking areas, or facilities on unified
sites shall require proof of all necessary easements and other agreements
that may be necessary to ensure continued cooperation and
responsibility over the shared facilities.
Where all or part of a parking lot serving uses on a parcel is leased to or
accepted by the Town or other quasi-public entity for use as a public
parking lot, the number of existing parking spaces, or the number of
parking spaces possible on the parcel under these regulations, shall
continue to be credited toward meeting the parking requirements of the
parcel, provided that the land is leased or transferred at no cost to the
Town or other quasi-public entity.
Pavement Standards
All parking areas and drives shall be constructed in accordance with the
Town of Windsor Engineering Standards and Specifications unless the
Commission requires a greater thickness where needed, grants a waiver
to the bituminous concrete paving requirement when the Town Engineer
finds another material to be equivalent or superior for the site, or
requires pervious pavement in accordance with Section 3.3.1G.
Required off-street parking facilities shall be properly maintained as long
as the use or structure that the facilities are designed to serve exists.
Unless shared parking is approved in accordance with Section 15.2.6,
required parking areas developed for specific structures and uses shall be
reserved at all times for those persons who make use of the premises.
Stalls shall be laid out according to approved plans.
In order to maintain proper access for emergency vehicles and to protect
the general public health and safety, all aisles and drives shall be kept
clear for movement of cars and emergency vehicles, and all potholes,
drainage problems, etc. shall be adequately repaired. If the Zoning
Enforcement Officer or his/her designee finds a condition (e.g., a pothole)
within the paved area that may endanger health or safety, the condition
shall be repaired or eliminated by the owner or other responsibility party
as soon as weather permits.

Driveway Standards
No lot shall have more than one curb cut and driveway for each 150 feet
of frontage. In order to protect public safety where traffic volume,
patterns, or street geometry warrants, the Commission may require that
only one curb cut and driveway serve any lot regardless of the length of
street frontage. In the case of corner lots, driveways shall be located at
least 150 feet from the intersection of the street lines of the lot or, in the
case of a lot with frontage of less than 150 feet, the driveway shall be as
far from the intersection as practical. Driveways entering streets at a
curve or at the crest of a hill shall be located to provide the maximum
sight distances possible. Joint use of driveways by adjacent lots is
encouraged.
Driveways shall not be more than 30 feet wide, measured at and parallel
to the street line, unless otherwise approved by the Town Engineer. A
curbed landscaped island may be required to define a separate entrance
and exit if a driveway wider than 30 feet is allowed.
Driveways shall not cross the street line (or its tangent in the case of a
curved street) at an angle of less than 45 degrees. Where a driveway
meets the street pavement, it shall be flared by curbs with radii of 20 feet
or more, tangent to the street curb (or outer edge of the shoulder when
the road is not curbed) and the driveway, or as specifically determined by
the Town Engineer or the State of Connecticut, where applicable.
Where there are two driveways serving the same lot, they shall be at least
100 feet apart, unless they are one-way driveways. The Director of Public
Safety or Legal Traffic Authority may require that any driveway be
suitably marked for entrance or exit only.
Feeder Drives
Except as per Section 3.3.4D, feeder drives adjoining standard parking
spaces, or two-way feeder drives adjoining oblique parking spaces shall
be no less than 24 feet in width (see Appendix, page A-15). Feeder drives
that adjoin oblique parking spaces or that are longer than 45 feet shall
provide continuous directional circulation. The Commission may waive
this requirement for non-retail/service uses if a turnaround area and
adequate on-site circulation is provided.

Collector Drives
Collector drives shall be no less than 30 feet in width and shall provide
continuous circulation. The Fire Marshal shall designate collector drives
(see Appendix, pages A-15 and A-16).
Vehicle Turnaround
Except for residential driveways serving individual dwelling units,
driveways and parking lots that require vehicles to back over a sidewalk
or street line are prohibited. The Commission may waive this
requirement for conversions of single-family dwellings to include two or
more dwelling units, after taking into consideration the intensity of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the street.
Traffic Flow Markings
Traffic flow patterns within a parking lot shall be marked with painted
arrows where required by the Director of Public Safety or Legal Traffic
Authority.
Parking Space Standards
In order for a parking space to be credited as a required space, it shall not
obstruct the use of another parking space and shall have access to a drive
that meets at least the feeder drive width standard (see Section 3.3.3E).
For parking spaces that require physical wheel stops, curbing shall be
provided. Bumper guards may be allowed only where excessive grade
changes require them for auto and driver safety. Precast wheel stops
may be permitted only where drainage flow between the wheel stops is
necessary.
If a standard parking space (i.e. a 9 ft. x 18 ft. perpendicular parking space)
does not front on a curbed wheel stop that a vehicle can overhang by at
least two feet (e.g., it fronts on another parking space, a bumper guard,
or a wall), the length of the parking space shall be 20 feet.
If necessitated by the geometry of the lot, the width of a two-way feeder
drive may be reduced to 22 feet, provided that the width of adjoining
standard parking spaces is increased by one foot.

ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
Provisions for Pedestrians
All sidewalks within parking areas or along their perimeter shall have a
net width of at least four feet, exclusive of any two-foot car overhang
area.
Unless waived by the Commission in accordance with Section 3.5.1F,
sidewalks shall be required along the street frontage of all new site
developments.
To encourage pedestrian circulation, the Commission may require a
sidewalk or trail connecting the principal building(s) to the required
sidewalk along the street or an alternative trail permitted under Section
3.5.1F below.
In Windsor Center, its Fringe Area, and the Wilson Study Area (south of
Putnam Memorial Highway), as depicted in the Plan of Conservation and

The stormwater drainage system required under the Stormwater
Management Ordinance shall be included with and considered as part of
the accompanying development application.
Drainage systems shall be designed and constructed to prevent runoff
from parking lots, roofs, and driveways from flowing over sidewalks.
In order to prevent flood damage within the site, in adjacent areas, and
downstream, the runoff flows of a 100-year, 24-hour return frequency
storm event extending across any property line shall not exceed the level
of flow prior to development.
Drainage devices may include, but shall not be limited to, one or more of
the following: drywells, catch basins or retention ponds, and shall be
approved by the Town Engineer.
In order to prevent water from entering buildings, the elevations of the
lowest floor and all at-grade openings, which shall be clearly shown on
the plans, shall be properly related to the final grading.
Grading
The grading plan shall show proposed finished contours at two-foot
intervals and proposed spot grades at the corners of all buildings, at lot
corners, and along the centerline of streets at no less than three points.
The proposed grading shall be verified in accordance with Section 16.8.2.
Elevations shall be based on either the Connecticut State Plane
Coordinate System (NGVD 29 and NAVD 88) or MDC datum.
The grading shall provide for proper drainage of the area. No
embankment shall exceed a slope of 2h:1v, unless suitable stabilization
procedures are provided by the applicant and approved by the Town
Engineer.
At the completion of the re-grading operation, the area re-graded, except
portions affected by structural or parking improvements, shall be
covered with four or more inches of soil capable of supporting a perennial
vegetative cover of suitable type and quantity to prevent erosion and to
restore its compatibility and harmony with its natural surroundings.

SIGNS
Intent
The Town of Windsor has established a rich and distinguished historical
identity within the State and an aesthetic character and scale of
development that is appropriate to that identity. It is the intent of this
Section to provide for appropriately designed signs that are suitable to
perform designated functions within a particular zone; compatible with
adjacent developments and land uses; and do not detract from property
values or threaten the public health, safety, or welfare.
General Requirements
Signs other than temporary public interest, public warning, and billboard
signs are classified as accessory uses.
Billboards are only permitted by special use in the Industrial and
Warehouse Zones as the scale of development in these zones is more
compatible with billboards than development in other zones where
billboards can be aesthetically incompatible, create visual clutter, and
diminish the character and quality of life in those areas, subject to the
following provisions.
(1) Any billboard structure shall be classified as the primary use of
the site on which it is constructed. The relevant requirements of
the zone on which the lot exists shall be adhered to for billboard
use.
(2) The sign area of any billboard shall be no larger than 400 square
feet and the total height of both the sign and structure shall not
exceed 35 feet.
(3) In order to take into account the relationship of travel speed,
distance, and comprehension of written messages, and in order
to minimize aesthetic harm, visual distractions, and the traffic
hazards that they may cause, the following location standards
shall be adhered to:
the placement of any billboard structure shall not be
within 1,500 feet (measured in a straight line) from any

major arterial (as defined in the POCD) and Archer Road;
and
billboards shall not be constructed within 1,500 feet
(measured in a straight line) of one another.
(4) The placement of any billboard structure shall not be such that it
is visible during any time of the year from any residential zone,
including residential zones in abutting towns, and shall not be
within 100 feet of any such property or town line.
(5) In order to protect the scenic beauty of two of our most
important natural resources, the placement of any billboard
structure shall not be within 3,000 feet (measured in a straight
line) from the Connecticut and Farmington Rivers.
(6) No more than 30 percent of existing trees 15 feet or taller shall
be cut down on a billboard site to accommodate any
development under this Section.
(7) Applications under this Section shall comply with the relevant
provisions of Section 15.
(8) There shall be a one-year time limit for all developments under
this Section.
(9) The fee for a billboard application shall be five dollars per square
foot of sign area.
Animated signs and electronic message centers are prohibited.
Signs painted directly on the surface of any wall are prohibited unless the
Commission finds that the sign will be in harmony with surrounding
developments, that the removal of the sign can be reasonably achieved
without harming the surface of the wall, and that the sign conforms to
sign area requirements.
Roof signs are prohibited.

Planner and Zoning Enforcement Officer may allow one additional
freestanding business or identification sign in lieu of a wall sign oriented
to be visible primarily from the limited access highway up to a maximum
of 200 square feet in area, to be subtracted from the wall sign area
permitted under Section 3.7.5B. If the Town Planner and Zoning
Enforcement Officer do not determine a need for a freestanding signs
based on the above criteria, at the applicant’s request, they may refer the
sign application to the Commission for their determination.
No site shall be allowed more than two types of business signs (i.e.
freestanding, projecting, or wall signs).
(reserved for future use)
Wall signs intended to be viewed from a limited access highway shall
comply with the following, as determined by the Town Planner and

Sign Illumination Regulations
Sign illumination that simulates traffic lights or emergency warning lights
is prohibited.
With the exception of internally illuminated channel letters and/or logos,
and internally illuminated signs with opaque backgrounds, where only
the copy and/or logos are illuminated at night, internally illuminated
signs are not a permitted accessory use.
The Commission may approve an internally illuminated sign with a
transcluscent background by special use if the applicant demonstrates
and the Commission finds that:
(1) the establishment for which the sign is intended is open a
significant number of hours after dark;
(2) the display of a background color is critical to the identification
of the establishment during nighttime business hours;
(3) the sign will not cause excessive glare or be overly distracting to
drivers;
(4) the sign is compatible with the building, the site and the
surrounding area;
(5) no sign faces are directed towards an abutting residential
property;
(6) the sign will not negatively affect abutting property values; and
(7) the Commission may limit sign illumination to only during normal
business hours.
To minimize the negative impacts of internally illuminated signs with
transluscent backgrounds, the permitted sign area shall be reduced by 50
percent.
All indirect illumination sources shall be shielded so that the light will not
shine in the eyes of pedestrians and motorists, nor cause unnecessary
glare into adjacent residential properties or the night sky.
Internally illuminated signs designed for viewing from only one side shall
be opaque on the opposite side.

Design
(1) Signs shall be designed in harmony with the building and
established surrounding development (see Appendix, pages A-18
and A-19),
(2) Signs that block the public's visibility of pedestrian or vehicular
traffic, public information signs, or traffic signals are prohibited.
Area
(1) In all zones, except single-family residential zones, the following
shall apply:
the maximum total area of all combined projecting and
wall sign(s) is calculated by multiplying the length of the
front wall of the building or establishment by the area
factor specified in (i), (ii) and (iii) below:
(i) one square foot of sign for each linear foot of the
front wall of buildings or establishments located
less than 100 feet from the street right-of-way;
(ii) one and one-half square feet of sign for each
linear foot of front wall of buildings or
establishments located between 100 feet and
200 feet from the street right-of-way; and
(iii) two square feet of sign for each linear foot of
front wall of buildings or establishments located
more than 200 feet from the street right-of-way.
for the purposes of this Section, the front wall of a
building or establishment shall be the wall containing the
main entrance.
if a site contains no occupied principal building (e.g., a
park or a construction site), the maximum allowable sign
area shall be limited to the maximum area for each
appropriate freestanding sign permitted in the zone, as
per Sections 3.7.7 through 3.7.15.
(2) The area of an actual or proposed sign shall be calculated by
measuring the area of the smallest rectangle that encompasses

integral part of the background of the sign or any color used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure that it is
placed on, but not including any supporting structure, bracing,
decorative fence, or wall that otherwise complies with these
Regulations and is clearly incidental to the sign itself.
(3) (reserved for future use)
(4) For freestanding and projecting signs, all sides containing text,
logos, or other graphics shall be included in the calculation of the
total sign area.
(5) Except as per Section 3.7.2B, the maximum allowable sign area
of permitted freestanding signs located on a lot that is greater
than the minimum lot width required in the underlying zone may
be modified according to the following formula, provided that no
sign exceeds two times the permitted area and the Town Planner
and Zoning Enforcement Officer find that larger signs will not
have an adverse impact:
D = (Y/X) x C
Where X = the minimum lot width
Y = the actual lot width
C = the maximum allowable freestanding sign
area and
D = the adjusted maximum allowable
freestanding sign area.
(See Appendix, page A-27, Example 2)
(6) Directional signs shall not be subtracted from the permitted
freestanding sign allocation, provided that a sign does not exceed
12 square feet and is not intended to be viewed from a street, or
where intended to be viewed from a street, does not exceed six
square feet and not more than 25 percent of the sign area is used
for a business name and/or logo. A sign permit must be obtained
and, if not approved at the time of site development approval,
the size and location of directional signs must first be jointly
approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and Town Planner
under Section 3.9 of these Regulations.
Approval and Violations
No signs shall be permitted in a public right-of-way unless the location is
approved by the Director of Public Safety or other relevant authorities.

INTERPRETATION AND
DEFINTIIONS
The average depth of the front yards in a subdivision shall not be less than
the required front yard depth.
The distribution of varied front yards shall be arranged to provide the
maximum variety of yard depths.
The Zoning Enforcement Officer and Town Planner may jointly authorize
an on-site change to any front yard depth setback modified under this
Section if they determine that a proposal constitutes a minor change, that
the average depth of the front yards in the subdivision will not be less
than the required front yard depth, and that some desirable site feature
will be preserved as a result of the change. An application shall be filed
under Section 3.9 to approve the change.
The Commission may waive the varied front yard requirement only when
it finds that:
(1) the road curvature, grade or the topography of the area
adequately breaks up the visual appearance of the line of homes
with the same front yard depth; and
(2) grading that results in excessive environmental damage would be
required to achieve varied front yards.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to flag lots.
One Principal Building Per Lot
Except as provided in Sections 4.5.3 and 13.2.5, in all single-family
residential zones, only one principal building is permitted on a lot.

the following.
Width Requirements
(1) For lots without a garage, driveways shall not exceed 18 feet in
width (measured parallel to the street).
(2) For lots with front entry garages, driveways shall not exceed a
width equal to the face of the garage or 18 feet, whichever is
greater, for a distance of 20 feet from the door(s), and shall be
tapered, if necessary, to 18 feet in width or less (measured
parallel to the street) for the remainder of the driveway.
(3) For lots with side entry garages, driveways shall not exceed 35
feet in width (measured perpendicular to the face of the garage)
across the face of the garage and shall be tapered to 18 feet in
width or less (measured parallel to the street) for the remainder
of the driveway.
In addition to the requirements of Section 4.4.12A, the driveway width
within 5 feet of the garage door may be increased by an additional 4 feet
total to catch drainage such as downspout flows, etc.
Unless jointly approved by the Town Planner and Zoning Enforcement
Officer, or the Commission, driveways shall be no closer than 6 feet from
a side property line. Upon proof of written notification to the affected
abutting property owner(s) by the applicant, the Town Planner and
Zoning Enforcement Officer may jointly approve driveways less than six
feet but greater than three feet from a side property line by utilizing the
Section 3.9 approval process without a fee, provided that the location of
the driveway and its use are appropriate to the lot configuration and
character of the surrounding area. Upon proof of written notification to
the affected abutting property owner(s) by the applicant, the

Section 4.5, shall comply with the provisions of Sections 4.5.6 and 15,
except 4.5.6A(4) if not a professional office building.
Conversion of Existing Buildings
The Commission may allow the conversion of existing buildings to
professional offices, home-based businesses, and residential uses in
Windsor Center and its Fringe Areas, as described in the Plan of
Conservation and Development, which for the purpose of this Section will
be defined as the Central Business District (CBD). The Commission may
also allow any use specified for residential zones within the CBD, in
buildings with frontage along Windsor Avenue in Wilson, from the
Hartford City line to I-291, which for the purpose of this Section will be
defined as the Wilson Business District (WBD).
Intent
The intent of this section is to:
(1) channel small but significant increases in residential densities to
the CBD and WBD;
(2) maximize the advantage of proximity to critical retail and mass
transit facilities in order to reduce dependence on automobiles;
(3) minimize the conflicts and allow for appropriate transitions at the
interface between business and residential areas;
(4) rehabilitate buildings and sites and stabilize property values; and.
(5) achieve objectives of the Plan of Conservation and Development.
Conditions
(1) The Commission shall determine that the physical characteristics
of the subject property (including site location, size, and
geometry) and the building size and design can be used as
proposed within the intent of these Regulations and that it will
not result in excessive impacts on adjacent properties.
(2) The applicant shall show and the Commission shall determine
that the building will be in acceptable exterior and interior
condition. Acceptable exterior condition shall mean, in part, that
the building will have no physical evidence from the exterior of
cracks in walls, foundations, or chimneys; no peeling or peeled
paint; nor no broken, misplaced, or damaged parts, members,

part, that interior spaces will be subdivided to appropriately
provide for the intended uses and that reasonable equipment,
appliances, etc. will be installed. The applicant may be required
to repaint, re-side, point masonry, and take whatever other
rehabilitation measures are necessary to achieve the intent of
this Section.
(3) The Commission shall determine that the site will be in
acceptable condition at project completion. Acceptable
condition shall mean that the minimum requirements of Section
3 are met, with the exception of the following requirements.
No new parking facility or drives shall be located within
ten feet of any property line. The ten-foot areas shall be
landscaped with fences, walls, and/or evergreen hedges
to screen the parking area and block auto headlight glare
to adjacent properties. The ten-foot area may be
reduced as per Section 3.1.2C(1).
The Commission may modify vehicle turnaround
requirements for single-family residential building
conversions to additional residential units as per Section
3.3.3G.
(4) Intensity of Use
For the purpose of this Section, each professional office
or major home-based business use shall be equivalent to
a dwelling unit for intensity of use-to-lot area and
interior area calculations.
One additional dwelling unit may be allowed if the
Commission finds that the intensified use is appropriate
for the building, site, and neighborhood, and that the site
and building meet zoning and other relevant code
requirements. More than one additional unit may be
allowed if an additional amount of land is available on
the site, equal to the minimum lot size requirement for
each additional unit.
(5) The lot must conform to the minimum area requirements of the
underlying zone.
(6) There shall be no exterior storage of material and no other
exterior indication of the major home-based business or
professional office, except for signs in accordance with Section
3.7.8G.

Open Space and Cluster Subdivisions
At its discretion, the Commission may allow development of open space
or cluster subdivisions that permit a reduction in lot requirements while
preserving land for open space, recreational, and/or other purposes in
specified zones on sites consisting of 10 acres or more, as provided
below.
Open Space Subdivisions
The Commission may allow the development of open space subdivisions
for single-family dwellings in AA and A Zones, provided that the following
conditions are met.
(1) The Commission shall determine that the proposed subdivision
site contains an area desirable for open space or for other public
purposes, based on the recommendations of relevant town
agencies and consideration of the land's size, shape, natural
features, location, and public access. The size and location of the
open space shall be determined by the Commission. Open space
shall be dedicated to the Town as per Section 14.1.21 or the
Commission may accept an alternate grantee such as a
homeowners' association, Windsor Land Trust, or other
responsible group.
Prior to issuing any Building Permits, appropriate
agreements, restrictions, and documents shall be
provided ensuring that the open space will be
maintained in perpetuity.
(2) The Commission shall find that the subdivision plan is designed
appropriately in relation to soil types, wetland areas,

(3) Except as provided below, the maximum number of lots
permitted in the proposed subdivision shall be determined by
multiplying the acreage of developable land by a density factor
of 1.3 for AA-Zoned land and by 1.6 for A-Zoned land.
(4) The lots in AA open space and A open space subdivisions shall
conform to the area, yard, and height requirements of Section
4.1.2 and Section 4.1.3, respectively.
(5) In addition to any open space required under Town of Windsor
Subdivision Regulations Section 4.7, the minimum amount of
land dedicated to the Town, a private residents’ association,
Windsor Land Trust, or other responsible entity shall be
determined by multiplying the acreage of the entire tract by the
percentage that the required minimum lot area is to be reduced.
The Commission may allow the area required for dedication to
be reduced by no more than ten percent if it finds that, if left as
part of individual lots to provide for screening and privacy, it
would result in a more desirable and appropriate development
than if it were dedicated. This area shall be protected by scenic
or conservation easements as per Section 14.1.22. The
percentage of undevelopable land to be dedicated shall not
exceed that of the entire subdivision.
(6) Additional scenic or conservation easements may also be
required as per Section 14.1.22.
Cluster Subdivisions
A cluster subdivision is a unique form of open space subdivision, intended
to provide a harmonious relationship between natural amenities and
residential developments. The Commission may approve cluster
subdivisions under Sections 4.5.2B(2) and (3) below, subject to the
following conditions.
(1) Overall Requirements
A cluster subdivision shall comply with the following overall
requirements.
The site shall be located within any single-family
residential zone(s).

INTERPRETATION AND
DEFINTIIONS
Except as provided below, the maximum number of lots
permitted shall be determined by multiplying the
acreage of developable land by a density factor of 1.3.
The site shall contain existing wooded areas of sufficient
density and size and of appropriate species to provide
adequate screening and privacy between proposed
dwellings and between proposed dwellings and public
areas or areas to be owned in common by the residents.
In specific cases, the Commission may find that
equivalent privacy and screening may be provided by
other unique natural site features (e.g., dramatic
topography). All cluster subdivision applications shall
clearly outline the method to reasonably ensure the
survival of natural site features critical to the provision of
screening and privacy (e.g., tree wells, mounds, root area
drainage systems, retaining walls).
All streets shall be built in accordance with both the
Town of Windsor Engineering Standards and
Specifications and the Town of Windsor Subdivision
Regulations, except that sidewalks may be provided in
alternative pedestrian travel locations through the open
space as acceptable to the Commission, and, in cul-desac
or loop streets, clearing and grading of more than 30
feet of the street right-of-way shall be discouraged,
unless site conditions require greater clearing or grading;
the resulting street pattern shall be as follows (see
illustrative sketch, Appendix, page A-25):
(i) Cul-de-sac or loop streets shall have vehicular
access only from distributor streets and other
cul-de-sac or loop streets unless the Commission
allows access from existing streets under Section
4.5.2B(1)(d)(iii); provide frontage and access to
at least three-quarters of the total number of
lots in the subdivision; be at least 500 feet apart
(measured between their center lines) if located
on the same side of the distributor street that
they have access to, unless the Commission finds
that because of the high density of trees or
topographic changes between certain cul-de-sac
or loop streets, a shorter distance will provide
equivalent screening and privacy as intended
under this Section; have at least a 50-foot buffer
strip of natural screening between distributor
streets and lots with frontage and access on culde-
sac or loop streets; and be owned and

maintained by a homeowners' association,
unless otherwise specifically recommended by
the Commission.
(ii) Distributor streets: for the purpose of this
Section, distributor streets (to be built as part of
the proposed subdivision) shall be those streets
that provide access to cul-de-sac or loop streets
but provide direct access and frontage to no
more than one-quarter of the dwelling units in
the subdivision.
(iii) Existing streets shall provide access only to
proposed distributor streets, except that the
Commission may allow no more than 15 percent
of cul-de-sac or loop streets in a proposed
subdivision to gain access directly from existing
streets if: (a) it is undesirable to gain access from
the proposed distributor streets because of
topographic and/or environmental reasons; (b) a
minimum 100-foot wide buffer strip of natural or
landscaped screening is provided between the
existing street and lots with frontage and access
on the proposed cul-de-sac or loop street; and
(c) the existing street serves in a distributor
street capacity (i.e., not a higher capacity street,
for example, an arterial street). No access shall
be provided directly to any dwelling from an
existing street and no dwelling unit shall be
located within 50 feet of the existing street rightof-
way line(s). This 50-foot area shall provide
natural or landscaped screening between the
dwellings within the cluster subdivision and the
existing street.
(iv) The total length of any combination of cul-de-sac
or loop streets shall not exceed 850 feet as
measured along the center line of the right-ofway
of said streets from the center line of the
nearest through street to the point where the
right-of-way begins to flare into a cul-de-sac or
loop street unless a greater length is authorized
by the Commission because of adverse
topographical conditions, difficult site
configuration, future road extension, or other
good cause.

INTERPRETATION AND
DEFINTIIONS
The Commission determines that the plan is designed
appropriately in relation to soil types, wetland areas,
watercourses, topography, scenic vistas, and other
natural features.
Because the allowed reduction of lot sizes makes
building and site design critical elements in ensuring
compliance with the intent of this Section, as part of its
review and evaluation of any cluster subdivision
application, the Commission shall factor landscaping and
the design and location of all buildings into their decision.
The minimum amount of land dedicated to the Town, a
private residents’ association, Windsor Land Trust, or
other responsible entity shall be determined by
multiplying the acreage of the entire tract by the
percentage that the required minimum lot area is to be
reduced from the AA lot area standard. The Commission
shall determine whether or not the land will be
dedicated entirely to the Town, entirely to another
responsible entity, or to a combination of the two.
Portions of dedicated land may exist as appropriately
landscaped, oversized cul-de-sacs or as loop streets. The
Commission may allow the area required for dedication
to be reduced as per Section 4.5.2A(5). The percentage
of undevelopable land to be dedicated shall not exceed
that of the entire subdivision.
(i) The dedication of land for public purposes shall
be as per Section 14.1.21.
(ii) The dedication of land (including that within
street[s]) to a private homeowners' association
shall be as per Section 14.1.21.
Additional scenic or conservation easements may also be
required as per Section 14.1.22.
Maximum building height: 2-1/2 stories, or 35 feet.
(2) Single-Family
Where the Commission finds that a site has characteristics meeting the
overall requirements and intent of this Section and that its development
with similar dwelling types would be more appropriate and desirable
than with a variety of dwelling types, the Commission may approve a
single-family cluster subdivision, as provided below:

amount of land dedicated to be determined by multiplying the acreage
of the entire tract by the percentage that the average lot area is reduced
from the AA lot area standard. For the purpose of calculating the average
lot area, no lot shall be considered to contain more than 27,500 square
feet.
Single-Family, Two-Family, and Multi-Family Dwellings
The intent of this Section is to provide greater flexibility in determining
the most appropriate residential development form for relatively small
sites restricted by natural or man-made physical conditions, adjacent
development, or property lines. A proposed development must be in
harmony with the surrounding area, designed and sited to protect
neighboring property values while respecting the site's natural or manmade
features, in compliance with the intent of this Section and the Plan
of Conservation and Development, and appropriately related to the
town's general needs regarding housing, community facilities, and open
space.
Miscellaneous Standards
The following shall be required for all developments proposed under this
Section.
(1) The maximum area shall be ten acres.
(2) All developments under this Section may be permitted in all
residential zones other than AA.
(3) All developments under this Section shall meet all relevant
standards of these Regulations and the Town of Windsor
Subdivision Regulations.
(4) The open space requirements of Section 4.7 of the Town of
Windsor Subdivision Regulations shall apply to all developments
under this Section. For calculating the fee in lieu of open space
for lot(s) with more than one dwelling unit, the required fee shall
be multiplied by the total number of dwelling units.
(5) The Commission shall review building elevations to ensure the
development is in harmony with the general character of the
neighborhood.
(6) Structures or paved areas for active recreation or for parking
areas of greater than five spaces shall not be permitted within
the required yards of the underlying zone.

(7) Regardless of the provisions in Subsection (6) above, no parking
areas shall be located closer than ten feet from any property line.
(8) Through paths, common parking areas, or drives shall not be
closer than 20 feet to any window or door of a residential unit.
(9) Drives and curb cuts shall be minimized. Whenever possible,
combined driveways shall be used for semi-attached or attached
dwellings.
(10) Lot area and yards or setbacks greater than permitted for the rest
of the proposed development may be required for lots along
some or all property lines in order to more appropriately relate
to existing or potential conventional single-family development
surrounding the site.
(11) Any density calculation under the subsection below shall exclude
areas identified in Section 4.2.1 of these Regulations.
Specific Standards
The following specific standards shall be complied with for each type of
development.
(1) Two-family dwellings on the same lot provide an opportunity for
rental units in owner-occupied structures, where both units
receive maximum privacy due to their side-by-side construction
(even if used to provide for "in-law" apartments).
The density of occupancy shall be as specified in the next
lower zone (e.g., in an A Zone, the density of occupancy
shall be 2.2 dwelling units per acre of developable land),
except that in the R-13 and R-8 Zones, the density of
occupancy shall be 2.7 and 3.3 dwelling units per acre of
developable land, respectively.
The lot area, yards, width, building coverage, and
building height standards shall be the standards for the
next higher zone. If the Commission determines that the
remaining land is not needed for public purposes, this
land shall be redistributed in the most appropriate
manner to any combination of lots.
In calculating number of dwelling units permitted, where
the area-density of occupancy calculation results in an
odd number and a fraction of a unit (e.g., 13-1/4), the
number may be rounded up to the next highest even
number (e.g., 14); for cases where the density calculation

whole even number shall be used (e.g., 12).
The building design standards shall comply with Section
13.2.5D(3).
The living area requirement of one of the two units shall
comply Section 4.2.2A(2). The minimum living area of
the other unit shall be as per Section 13.2.5D(1)(b).
(2) Single-family and two-family dwellings on separate lots intended
to provide economies of scale in terms of construction and land
costs, subject to the following requirements.
The density of occupancy shall be that specified in the
next lower zone (e.g., in an A Zone, the density of
occupancy shall be 2.2 dwelling units per acre of
developable land), except that in cases involving the R-13
and R-8 Zones, the density of occupancy shall be 2.7 and
3.0 dwelling units per acre of developable land,
respectively.
The lot area, yards, width, building coverage, and
building height standards shall be the standards for the
next lower zone, except that there shall be no required
side yard where the dwelling units are attached and the
required front yard shall be that of the underlying zone.
In cases involving the R-8 Zone, the requirements for that
zone shall apply. In A, R-13 and R-11 Zones, the
Commission may permit the lot area of a second lower
zone only if it finds a need for land for public purposes.
The calculation of number of dwelling units shall be as
per Section 4.5.3B(1)(c).
The building design standards shall comply with Section
13.2.5D(3).
(3) Multi-family dwellings intended to permit a small development
of attached dwellings on the same lot or on separate lots (e.g.,
townhouses), or garden or terrace apartment dwellings, or any
suitable combination thereof, subject to the following.
Lots fronting on primary, secondary, or collector streets
as classified by the Plan of Conservation and
Development, as amended, shall not be designed to
allow each dwelling unit to have its own separate
driveway onto these streets.

Compliance with applicable provisions of Sections
13.2.3B(7) and 13.2.5D(1).
For a development of attached dwellings on the same
lot, the development plan shall conform to the yard
requirements of the more restrictive underlying zone
and the density of occupancy shall be that of the next
lower zone(s) (e.g., in an A Zone, the density of
occupancy shall be 2.2 dwelling units per acre of

development in the R-13 and R-8 Zones, the density of
occupancy shall be 2.7 and 3.3 dwelling units per acre of
developable land, respectively.
For a development of attached dwellings on separate
lots, the development plan shall conform to the following
yard and area requirements:
Minimum lot area – 2,400 square feet
Minimum front yard – as per Section 4.5.2B(2)(b)
Minimum side yard – 0 feet, except for the end units,
which shall have a minimum side yard on one side of 25
feet
Minimum rear yard – 40 feet
The density of occupancy shall be that of the next lower
zone(s) (e.g., in an A Zone, the density of occupancy shall

dwelling units per acre of developable land, respectively.
(4) Modifications
The Commission may modify Section 4.5.3B(2) to allow a development of
single-family dwellings on the same lot in cases where all appropriate
requirements of Section 4.5.3B(2) are met and, in the opinion of the
Commission, strict application of the requirements of the Section will
result in an overall design which is less desirable than one permitted by a
modification of the requirements of the Section. The Commission shall
not grant a request for modification of the requirements of the Section
unless justified by adverse geographical conditions, difficult site
configuration, or modifications to site design or layout requested by the
Commission.

If undevelopable land containing floodplains, steep slopes, wetlands or
watercourses is desired for public access and ownership for passive
recreation, such as providing a critical link in a trail network or access to
a water resource, the Commission may allow the transfer of residential
density according to density of the underlying zone for a limited area
determined by the Commission to be sufficient for the intended purpose.
The receiving parcel that density is to be transferred to shall be physically,
geologically, and geometrically suitable to accommodate the greater
density with minimal adverse effects on adjacent development, and
conveniently located near public and private services, mass transit, etc.
without overburdening them.
The maximum resulting density shall not exceed the following:
(1) single-family zone: twice the density of the underlying zone;
(2) AG Zone: (see Section 10.5.10);
(3) Neighborhood, New Neighborhood, and Peripheral
Neighborhood Design Developments: one additional dwelling
unit per acre; and
(4) Center Design Development: five additional dwelling units per
acre.
The resulting development may contain any combination of single-family,
semi-attached, or multi-family dwellings, in proportions established by
the Commission, provided that in single-family zones (excluding Design
Developments), buildings shall not exceed the height standard of the
underlying zone.
The maximum number of dwelling units that may be transferred to a
single-family zone in one application is 50 dwelling units.
The Commission must determine that the transfer of density concept is
preferable to conventional development on both the sending and
receiving parcels.

(iii) live or recorded entertainment shall cease no
later than 1 A.M. Sunday through Thursday and
2 A.M. on Friday and Saturday, except that the
Commission may further limit these hours where
live or recorded entertainment has the potential
to become a nuisance to the area.
In determining the appropriateness of the use and if
necessary, specifying a time limit or further limiting
either the hours of operation or the provision of
entertainment, the Commission may consider the
following conditions: traffic safety, density of similar
establishments, the size of the facility, service of
alcoholic liquor, type of entertainment provided, takeout
service, and proximity to residences and other
potential sensitive uses.
For establishments of less than 500 square feet located
in existing buildings in Windsor and Wilson Centers (as

of full-service restaurant. Substantial changes in the
provision of liquor and/or the addition of limited
entertainment facilities to an existing full-service
restaurant shall constitute a substantial change in the
character and intensity of the use, requiring a new
special use. For the purposes of this Section only,
principal use means that no more than 15 percent of the
gross floor area (including storage areas) may be devoted
to cocktail lounge or bar. This measurement shall be
derived by calculating the area encompassed by the bar,
the associated stools, and a three-foot aisle beginning at
the back of the stools. No more than 25 percent of the
gross floor area (including storage areas) may be devoted

more specifically, of the area surrounding the proposed
site.
The proposed use meets the applicable provisions of
Section 15.
(4) Exceptions
The provisions of this Section shall not apply to:
ear piercing; or
tattooing performed by a physician, osteopathic
physician, or a registered nurse in preparation for a
medical procedure.
Developments in Windsor Center (see Appendix, page A-28) and Wilson
Center (see Appendix, page A-23) involving large buildings with a first
floor area of 3,000 square feet or more. Large buildings in village settings
can create significant traffic impacts because of their relatively high
activity levels and, because of their bulk, can negatively affect the
character of Windsor Center and Wilson Center. In addition to the factors
indicated in Section 15 of these Regulations, the Commission shall
determine that the proposed development does not create excessive
traffic impacts and that all proposed large buildings are designed so that
their form, scale, materials, and details are compatible with the form,
scale, materials, and details of buildings prevalent in Windsor Center and
Wilson Center.
In order to provide flexibility while not compromising the character of the
development of Windsor Center (see Appendix, page A-28), certain
requirements of Section 5.2.4D may be modified by the Commission after
giving consideration to relevant provisions of Section 15, the appearance
of the four closest principal buildings, and as per the following conditions.
(1) The Commission may allow a one-story building if the roof of the
building is constructed with adequate pitch, dormers, and
structure so that the attic can be easily converted into a useable
second floor in the future. The plan shall provide for adequate
access ways to the second floor, insulation, rough finishes,
electric lines, and capped sewers.
(2) The minimum requirement for glazing on the sides of buildings
facing any street may be reduced by up to 20% per story (i.e. the
minimum requirement of 25% for the first story may be reduced
to no less than 20%, while the minimum requirement of 10% for

(3) Front yards may be modified by up to five feet.
(4) The Commission may allow the use of cementicious, vinyl, metal,
or similar siding material (with a maximum exposure of 4-½
inches) if it is similar in appearance to wooden clapboard or
shakes.
(5) For all Business, Industrial, and Warehouse Zoned areas shown
on the Wilson Study Area map (see Appendix, page A-29), the
Commission may approve the installation of commercial security
structures no closer than 18 inches from the interior of window
or door glazing after considering the recommendations of the
Police and Fire Departments regarding public safety and impacts
on public safety personnel if the following is complied with:
The Commission shall determine that the use is uniquely
in need of the security structure(s), the Police
Department has been unsuccessful in protecting the
existing business or other businesses similarly at risk, and
electronic security devices installed on the premises
have proven ineffective. When and if the use changes,
the structure(s) shall be removed unless re-approved by
the Commission for a new use under this Section. To
ensure the removal of the commercial security
structure(s), a cash bond determined by the Building
Official to be sufficient to cover the cost of removing the
structure(s), shall be submitted prior to issuance of a
Building Permit, which shall be returned upon removal of
the structure(s).
The window and/or door security structure(s) is/are
retractable and concealed during normal business hours.
In order not to obstruct visibility into the interior and
impact the safety of employees or responding
emergency personnel, no more than 15% of the total
window or door glazing may be obscured by the security
structure(s).
The Police and Fire Departments shall have a key(s) to
the security structure(s).
The Commission shall find that the security structure(s)
is/are minimally visible, decorative in appearance, and

concrete, and glass in the applicable sides of the original structure.
Except where lack of windows would compromise the character of the
surrounding area, the Commission may reduce the minimum glass
requirement for data centers, utility structures, or similar buildings,
where windows would compromise the security and/or cooling
requirements.
The roof of the largest part of the building shall appear to be flat from the
front and the two sides.

public, other than lodgers, will only be permitted if the
Commission finds that adequate additional site area is available
to accommodate the facilities and their generated parking needs.
(9) The maximum building height shall be 75 feet. However, for the
approval of a height greater than 60 feet, the site shall be located
100 feet or more from any residential or AG Zone, and the layout
of the site shall either allow fire apparatus to access all areas of
all floors and the roof, or allow fire apparatus to access some

standards.
(10) The minimum room size shall be 400 square feet.
Buildings with a height between 60 and 80 feet containing seven stories
or less.
While tall buildings provide opportunities to reduce building coverage
and create aesthetically impressive developments, they have unique
characteristics that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to identify
and mitigate potential negative impacts on surrounding uses and the
provision of town services. For these reasons, the Commission may allow
the construction of a building with a height between 60 and 80 feet,
provided that the Commission determines that:
(1) the building is located at least 100 feet from a residential or AG
Zone;
(2) the proposed development is served by streets with adequate
capacity;
(3) at least 75% of all exterior walls shall be of glass, brick, or a
combination thereof; and
(4) the layout of the site shall either allow fire apparatus to access
all areas of all floors and the roof or allow fire apparatus to access
some point of each floor and the roof with the building built to
high-rise standards.

(3) provided that there is sufficient parking to accommodate the
additional traffic, the Commission may permit a nursing home to
extend in-patient dialysis services to non-residents on an outpatient
basis as an accessory use.
Film Studios
(1) A film studio facility may include:
retail facilities;
commercial recreation facilities;
restaurants per Section 5.2.6D;
a trade school or college associated with the film
industry;
film studio residences, provided that these shall be
clearly an accessory use to the facility and not for public
use;
an outside film stage, provided that no area used for an
outside film stage shall be located within 500 feet of a
street; and
outside storage area, provided that an area used for
outside storage shall not be visible from any street.
(2) The Commission may approve up to 30% of the total building
area or 90,000 square feet, whichever is less, for retail,
commercial recreation, and restaurant uses for walk-in
customers, and a trade school or college associated with the film
industry that may incidentally serve walk-in customers, if the
Commission finds these accessory uses to be compatible with the
main use and a traffic and parking study shows that the film
studio facility and the accessory retail, commercial recreation,
restaurant, and trade school uses can all be supported onsite.
(3) If the Commission finds that no substantial evidence exists for
potential nuisances associated with restaurants providing
alcohol for on-premises consumption, the Commission may
eliminate the 400-foot distance requirement between the center
of the main entrance of the facility and either a daycare facility,
playground, or sports field.

open space would be two-thirds of the total area of the development).
At the discretion of the Commission, the open space can be dedicated to
the Town as provided in Section 14.1.21; to another grantee acceptable
to the Commission, such as the State of Connecticut, Windsor Land Trust,
a wildlife association or other nonprofit entity, whose main purpose is to
convey a public benefit; or where continued farming is desirable and
public access is not desirable, it can be left in private ownership and
protected by a permanent conservation easement.

DESIGN DEVELOPMENTS
INTENT
The intent of Design Developments is to permit groups of principal
buildings or uses as a unified development on a single lot or across
contiguous lots and to permit flexibility from conventional zoning
requirements under strict control and design review to assure that the
intent of these Regulations is carried out. Design Developments are
established to facilitate a more harmonious relationship between the
development, the site, and the surrounding area than is possible under
conventional zoning regulations, while protecting the community and
abutting properties. A Design Development is an optional development
that may be permitted instead of development under the requirements
of the underlying zone(s). An applicant may revert to development
permitted in the underlying zone(s) at any time prior to actual
construction and after appropriate notification in writing to the
Commission.
CENTER DESIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Purpose
The purpose and intent of the Center Design Developments are to:
encourage rehabilitation and redevelopment through flexibility of uses
and design in appropriate areas of Windsor Center and Wilson Center;
whenever possible, provide for the preservation of meaningful historic
buildings, promote appropriate architectural and site design, and provide
amenities that will encourage pedestrian use and enjoyment of the
centers;
promote improvements to vehicular circulation patterns, reduce curb
cuts on main arterials, and provide safer pedestrian, bicycle and
handicapped access, separate from driveways and streets when feasible;
promote uniform and appropriate design themes for the centers through
architectural and site design review as well as strict sign controls;
promote residential densities that maximize the limited potential for
redevelopment within walking distances of mass transit, potentially

financial services; professional and general offices; restaurants
meeting the requirements of Section 5.2.6D; public and semipublic
institutions; hotels and residential uses, including livework
units. The Commission shall find all proposed uses to be
harmonious with the goals and objectives of the Plan of
Conservation and Development; harmonious with center-type
uses (i.e. not disruptive of the general retail, service and
residential character and function of the Center(s) and its
pedestrian orientation); and not of a quasi-industrial or highwayoriented
character or overly dependent on truck or auto traffic
as a primary means of conducting business.

the elimination of yards.
(3) Outdoor lighting and signs shall comply with Sections 3.2 and 3.7
respectively, except that in the interest of public safety, the
Commission may allow limited light trespass from pedestrianscaled
lighting fixtures into the public right-of-way; or may
impose stricter lighting or signage requirements when, in its
judgment, the specific proposal demands them. The location and
design details (e.g., materials, illumination) of all outdoor lighting
and signs shall be shown on the plans.
(4) Parking Standards
Parking ratios shall comply with Section 3.3.5 and Section
13.1.3B(5)(c) where applicable;
the Commission may reduce the required number of
parking spaces in a mixed-use development in
accordance with the Standards of Section 15.2.7;
the Commission may allow parking spaces in excees of
any maximum requirement, provided that they are
deferred until a future need is demonstrated by the use
and occupancy of the development; and
the Commission may require that parking spaces in
excees of minimum or maximum requirements be
constructed of pervious pavement if it determines that
the spaces will be used infrequently.

the Commission finds that in granting an increase in
density, the benefits of the proposed development with
respect to the health, safety, convenience, and general
welfare of the community will likely outweigh any
adverse impacts associated with the increased
development density;
in granting an increase in the maximum building height
to four stories or 60 feet, which may be independent of
an increase in the base density, the Commission must
determine that the height is appropriate for the site and
that the benefits of the proposed development with
respect to the health, safety, convenience, and general
welfare of the community will likely outweigh any
adverse impacts associated with the increased building
height. Where topography allows structured parking
beneath and accessed from the side or rear of buildings,
the Commission may allow a maximum building height of
65 feet, provided that the Fire Department is able to
adequately serve the building;
to promote walking in Windsor Center and the use of
readily available mass transit in the area east of the
Amtrak railroad line, parking shall be provided at a
maximum ratio of one parking space per dwelling unit for
one-bedroom and studio units, one and one-half (1.5)
parking spaces for two-bedroom units, and two parking
spaces for all other units; and
in order to reduce hazards and improve pedestrian
access as recommended in the Plan of Conservation and
Development, the Commission may require an adequate
bridge or tunnel to allow grade separated pedestrian
crossing of the Amtrak railroad tracks if Amtrak/DOT’s
existing or planned facilities for pedestrian circulation,
safety, and access to the western side of the railroad
tracks do not provide a reasonable alternative.
Building Standards
(1) Minimum Living Area Requirements for Residential Units
Multi-Family Dwellings:
One-Bedroom/Studio: an average living area per unit of no less
than 650 square feet, averaged across the development,
provided no indivudal unit shall be less then 500 square feet.

residential communities, affording maximum opportunities for people of
different economic and social characteristics to find a housing and living
style suitable to their needs and desires;
provide for usable, suitably located recreational facilities and other public
and common facilities;
preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the existing landscape features,
amenities and natural resources of the Town and promote a distribution
of structures and open areas to prevent environmental or flood damage;
permit greater flexibility and, consequently, more varied creative and
imaginative architecture, and site design more harmoniously related to
the land than would otherwise be possible under conventional land
development procedures; and
promote the efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic
arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land use, and utilities.
General Requirements and Provisions
The following general requirements and provisions shall apply to all
Neighborhood Design Developments.
The Commission may permit retail, commercial, and service facilities
(excluding adult-oriented establishments, as defined in Section 2.2),
which are clearly accessory to and primarily serve the proposed and
immediately surrounding residential development. Approval shall be
granted only if the Commission determines that a need exists for the
proposed uses and that the buildings and site layout are well-related to
roads and adjacent development. The commercial and service facilities
shall not contain more than 15,000 square feet of gross floor area. Unless
otherwise specified or specifically changed, the requirements of Section
5.1 shall be met.

A gross density of up to three dwelling units per acre of
developable land (as described in Section 4.2.1) is
permitted, which may be increased up to four dwelling
units per developable acre in accordance with Section
4.5.8.
Roads within the development may be private. All
private streets, pedestrian sidewalks, and parking lots
shall be built to the structural specifications of the Town
of Windsor Subdivision Regulations and the Town of
Windsor Engineering Standards and Specifications,
except that the following modifications may be allowed:
(i) primary streets shall have a minimum road width
of 28 feet;
(ii) concrete sidewalks may be required, where
appropriate, but only along one side of the
street;
(iii) curbing, drainage, pavement width and cul-desac
requirements may be modified by the
Commission when such modifications will result
in a superior plan than that possible under the
regular standards adopted by the Town; and
(iv) any existing parking lots shall be considered nonconforming
and may be modified to the extent
that the non-conformity is not increased.
All buildings erected in a Recreational Neighborhood
Design Development shall observe the following location
requirements and shall be separated by at least:
(i) 20 feet from another building;

(vi) existing buildings to remain, if non-conforming,
shall be exempt from these location
requirements.
A landscape buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall
be provided along the perimeter of the property that
abuts a single-family residential zone where buildings in
the proposed development are located within 200 feet
of the property line abutting that single-family
residential zone. However, where variations in
topography or natural features, existing vegetation,
landscaped recreational amenities, or compatible land
uses obviate the need for a buffer, this requirement may
be waived. The buffer strip requirement shall be waived
to allow for existing recreational improvements and
existing parking areas to remain.
No building shall be located closer than 20 feet from the
right-of-way of any proposed public through street. No
active recreation facility such as swimming pools, tennis
courts, or clubhouses shall be built closer than 50 feet
from any external property line. Through paths,
common parking areas, or drives shall not be closer than
20 feet to any window or door of a residential unit.
In approving the mix of housing type, the Commission
shall consider the following:
(i) appropriate relationship of the development to
the physical conditions of the site including
wetlands, topography, and geologic forms; and
(ii) the primary purpose of the development
concept as an active recreational community
which also serves the general public.
Building Design Standards
In addition to the building design standards of Section 13.2.4,
Recreational Neighborhood Design Developments shall comply with the
following building standards.
(1) Multi-Family Dwellings
Multi-family dwellings without individual basements
shall be provided with individual dead storage areas (at
least 100 square feet per unit) and indoor laundry

facilities, both of which shall be accessible from within
the dwelling without the need to go outdoors. Where
basements, which would typically be used for dead
storage, provide for other uses such as covered parking,
some storage may be provided for in the basement and
the balance in individual residential units. Such storage
may be configured as requested by the resident and/or
as required by application of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA). All dwelling units shall have at
least one balcony or patio which shall provide relative
privacy by architectural articulation or, in case of patios,
by fencing, planting, or paving.
Structures shall be designed so as to avoid visually
massive and monotonous building facades. In doing so,
the proposed architectural design shall address scale and
height compatibility, rhythm of recurring patterns of
lines, shapes and forms, and articulation of entryways,
balconies, roofs, and exterior walls of individual units. In
addressing design, the proposed development shall also
take into account architectural forms, materials, and
textures.
The Commission shall be provided with information on
the colors and materials to be used on the exterior of the
buildings.
Exterior wall surfaces of all multi-family dwellings within
eight feet of grade and adjacent to activity areas where
rapid deterioration might occur (e.g., entries, balconies,
patios) shall have a veneer of durable material of suitable
color and texture compatible with the architectural
theme of the community.
Minimum dwelling unit sizes, exclusive of dead storage
in basement shall be:
one-bedroom: 800 square feet;
two-bedroom: 1000 square feet;
150 square feet of additional area for each additional
bedroom; and
where the Commission finds that patios or balconies
afford relative privacy by architectural articulation or, in
the case of patios, by fencing, planting, or paving, the
fencing is integrated into the wall structure to avoid a
“tacked-on” effect and provides adequate strength; and
that the patio or balcony is not oriented to a parking area

Two-family dwellings shall be as per Section 13.2.4B.
(3) All Buildings
The Commission may allow buildings up to three stories, but no
more than 45 feet in height, when in its judgment it would be
consistent with the overall project design, compatible with
surrounding areas and preserves valuable open space land.
When covered parking is provided under a building and to
accommodate existing topographic conditions, the average
height of a building may be up to 50 feet.
Traditional Neighborhood Design Developments
The purpose of the Traditional Neighborhood Design Development
(TNDD) is to encourage innovative mixed-use, compact development that
is sensitive to the environmental characteristics of the land and facilitates
the efficient use of services as an alternative to conventional, usesegregated
development. A traditional neighborhood diversifies and
integrates land uses within close proximity to each other and has the
potential to provide for daily employment, recreational, and shopping
needs. The TNDD seeks to connect people to places by combining
alternative housing types with office, retail, civic, educational,
recreational, medical, hotel and conference centers, and limited
industrial uses into a pedestrian-friendly walkable neighborhood. The
intent is to minimize traffic congestion, suburban sprawl, infrastructure
costs, and environmental degradation, thereby making a TNDD a
sustainable, long-term community that provides economic opportunity
and environmental and social equity for its residents.
General Requirements and Provisions
(1) A Traditional Neighborhood is generally characterized by design
elements that may include:
pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods;
a variety of housing types;
a diverse and integrated set of uses;

House Orientation
Intent
The intent of this Section is to address house siting problems created by
narrow lots in residential zones. In order to preserve property values and
especially the established architectural character of older
neighborhoods, special consideration must be given to house orientation
on narrow lots as follows.
(1) On any interior or through lot where the lot width is 65 feet or
less, the principal structure shall be oriented so that the plane of
its longer wall faces the street on which the lot fronts. For
through lots, the lot shall front on the street that is improved to
the higher standard, as determined by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer.
(2) On any corner lot where the lot width is 65 feet or less, the
principal structure shall be oriented so that the plane of its longer
wall faces the street with the greater number of houses with the
plane of their longer walls oriented toward that street.
Electrical and Communication Transmission Lines
All electrical and telecommunication cables or wires shall be buried
underground from the nearest source to the development that they are
intended to serve, in a location approved by the Town Engineer. If the
Town Engineer and the Town Planner jointly agree that an underground
connection from the source to the proposed development is inordinately
difficult due to adverse site conditions such as the presence of significant
ledge or inland wetlands, they may waive the requirement for all or part
of that underground connection.
Public and Private Roadway Design
Public and private roadway design criteria shall be as per Section 4.8.3 of
the Town of Windsor Subdivision Regulations.
Commercial Security Structures
The use of commercial security structures can greatly reduce visibility
into establishments and may compromise the safety of emergency
services personnel and the building’s occupants. When unwarranted,
commercial security structures can also negatively impact surrounding
property values. As a result, commercial security structures are not
permitted by right within the B-1 and B-2 Zones, or commercial areas in
the PUD Zone, except by special use in accordance with Section 5.2.6O(5).

(4) Maximum clear height of any floor shall be less than 20 feet.
(5) To visually break up the bulk and scale of large buildings, off-sets
of no less than 5 feet for every 100 feet in horizontal dimension
shall be required. The off-sets may be combined as designed by
the applicant and agreed to by the Commission. The total length
of required off-set(s) must be maintained.
(6) For offices, research-laboratories, research/development, and
computer centers, the roof of buildings shall be flat in
appearance when observed from all sides of the building. For flex
space, manufacturing, fabricating, compounding, or treatment of
articles, the roof of buildings shall be flat or flat in appearance on
the front and two side views.
(7) Any gutter or down spouts on front and side walls shall be within
roofs and walls.
(8) Ground or roof mounted mechanical equipment and dumpsters
shall not be visible from Day Hill Road, Northfield Drive, or
Orange Way, as applicable. The screening method shall use
materials that are the same as or most compatible with material
of the building (e.g., for parapets), except that for equipment and
dumpsters behind the building and not visible from the two

(3) Dimensional Exceptions for Certain Residential Lots
The intent of this Section is to provide a mechanism to
allow for appropriate reductions of the front yard
requirements for additions to existing dwellings and for
the construction of new residential dwellings in areas
that were substantially developed prior to the
enactment of these Regulations and generally contain
non-conforming front yards.
In order to comply with the above-stated intent, the
Town Planner and Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
determine that:
(i) the new dwelling or addition to an existing
dwelling is no closer to the property line than the
average front yard setback of the nearest two
structures on the same block face to either side
of the proposed construction (up to four
structures total) or 20 feet, whichever is greater;
(ii) when an addition or new dwelling is proposed
adjacent to a corner lot, the average front yard
setback shall be calculated from the setback of
the structure on the corner lot and the nearest
two structures on the same block face opposite
the corner lot; and
(iii) when an addition or new dwelling is proposed on
a corner lot, the average front yard setback for
each side of the dwelling facing a street shall be
calculated from the setback of the nearest two
structures on the same block face parallel to that
side.
Non-Residential Lots Adjacent to a Railroad Spur
In a non-residential district, no yard shall be required for that portion of
a lot contiguous to a railroad spur giving railroad access to that lot.
Residential Buildings Adjacent to Limited Access Highways, Railroads,
Industrial, or Warehouse Zones
(1) No dwellings may be constructed within 150 feet of the nearest
pavement line of a limited access highway or its entrance and exit
ramps.

(2) No dwellings may be constructed within 150 feet of a railroad
track unless approved by the Commission in connection with
developments under Sections 4.5 or 13.1.
(3) The distance between the rear wall of any dwelling and a rear
residential property line abutting an Industrial or Warehouse
Zone line shall be no less than 100 feet, except that the
Commission may reduce the distance by up to 10 feet where
adequate changes in topography, berms, and/or evergreen
vegetation provide adequate screening.
All Non-Residential Lots
The side or rear yard for a building connector shall be 0 feet.
Accessory Structures that Exceed Maximum Building Heights
No accessory structure described below may be erected higher than the
maximum building height specified for each district, except as follows:
In all residential zones, accessory structures such as chimneys and flag
poles are allowed if the resulting total height (including supporting
structure) is not greater than 12 feet higher than the maximum allowable
building height measured from ground level and the height of the
structure is less than its distance from any property line. Structures more
than 12 feet higher than the maximum allowable building height, but less
than 100 feet total height, may be allowed by special use if the height of
the structure is less than its distance from any property line (for accessory
buildings, see Section 4.4.1). Ground or roof-mounted dish antennas are
excluded from the provisions of this Subsection (see Sections 4.4.11,
4.5.9, 10.5.15 and applicable sections of 14.2.16 for ground or roofmounted
dish antenna regulations and for tower-mounted dish
antennas, see Section 14.2.16C(3)(f)).
In all non-residential zones, accessory structures such as storage bins,
silos, chimneys, spires, steeples, and dish antennas are allowed if the
resulting total height is not greater than 20 feet above the maximum
allowable building height measured from ground level and the height of
the structure is less than its distance from any property line. Structures
more than 20 feet higher than the maximum allowable building height,
but less than 100 feet in total height, may be allowed by special use if the
height of the structure is less than its distance from any property line.
Ground or roof-mounted dish antennas shall not be more than 12 feet in
diameter and shall be screened from street view by structures, fences,
walls, or plantings (for tower-mounted dish antennas, see 14.2.16C(3)(f).

applicable minimum yard, unless a smaller distance is otherwise
permitted by these Regulations.
Narrow Parts of Lot Not Counted Towards Area Requirements
On lots created by subdivision or free split, or modified subsequent to the
effective date of these Regulations, the following lot area restrictions
shall apply:
Any portion of a lot that is narrower than one-third of the minimum lot
width shall not be included in the minimum lot area (see Appendix, page
A-4).
Any portion of a lot exceeding one-third of the minimum lot width that is
separated from the main body of the lot by a portion of the lot that is

Mobile Food Vendors
Intent
Mobile food vendors, under the Town of Windsor Code of Ordinances,
may locate at a property with the owner's written permission and sell
their wares to persons working or living there, and then move to another
property. The Town Code does not address stationary locations, both
within public rights-of-way as well as on state and private property. The
intent of this Section is to allow mobile food vendors to temporarily
locate on suitable private property, subject to the following

(1) For the purposes of this Section, “applicant” shall refer to both
the licensed carrier and the land owner.
(2) Co-location is encouraged and preferred to the construction of a
new mount if the facility does not extend more than 10 feet
above the antenna mount, or in the case of electric transmission
tower antenna mounts, it does not extend more than 15 feet
above the antenna mount. Both the applicant and owner shall
commit to allow co-location. In the event that the applicant finds
co-location to be impractical, the Commission may retain a
technical expert to verify if co-location at the site is feasible or
not. The cost for the technical expert shall be at the applicant’s
expense.
(3) The Commission may require the investigation of alternative
sites by the applicant and evidence of a good faith effort to colocate
with other carriers. In the event that the applicant finds
alternate sites to be impractical, the Commission may retain a
technical expert to verify if the alternate sites are feasible or not.
The cost for the technical expert shall be at the applicant’s
expense.
(4) Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or
accessory use. An existing telecommunication facility or other
use on the site shall not preclude the location of a new facility on
the site if the new facility meets the intent and requirements of
these Regulations.
(5) The applicant shall present evidence that the proposal meets the
minimum requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or any other
applicable town, state or federal codes, standards, or
requirements.
(6) If the Commission determines that a proposed facility will result
in significant negative impacts, it shall not be approved.
(7) The licensed carrier shall notify the Commission of its intent to
abandon a wireless telecommunications facility by certified mail
no less than 30 days prior to abandonment.
If a licensed carrier fails to give such notice, the wireless
telecommunications facility shall be considered
abandoned upon discontinuation of operations.

an expired wireless telecommunication facility or denial of a
renewal of the facility shall be a zoning violation and subject to
the abandonment procedure specified above.
(10) Applicant(s) shall maintain the wireless telecommunications
facility, including but not limited to painting, maintaining
structural integrity, and landscaping. In the event that the
applicant(s) fails to maintain the facility, the Town of Windsor
may undertake the maintenance at the expense of the applicant
and/or landowner.
(11) Within 90 days of a wireless telecommunications facility
becoming operational, the applicant(s) shall submit actual field
measurements of radio frequency (RF) radiation and shall copy
the Commission on all further correspondence with the FCC
regarding RF radiation.
Should either actual field measurements significantly exceed
levels projected at the time of application or the Commission
requires future co-location at a new wireless telecommunication
tower, to the degree possible, the maximum future projected RF
radiation levels shall be submitted to the Commission.

(12) If a facility is constructed on Town property, the Town shall be
held harmless from any responsibility for structural failures,
nuisances or other negative impacts of the facility.
(13) In order to promote economic development, the Commission
may consider the adequacy of service in commercial and
industrial areas when evaluating any application.
(14) Application for any wireless telecommunication facility shall be
made only by a licensed carrier. The applicant(s) shall provide
written notice to the Commission within 90 days of any changes
in applicant or ownership of a wireless telecommunications
facility.
(15) Except as provided for tower-mounted dish antennas in Section
14.2.16C(3)(f) below, ground or roof-mounted dish antennas are
exempt from this Section (for residential ground or roofmounted
dish antennas, see Sections 4.4.11 and 4.5.9, and for
other than residential ground or roof-mounted dish antennas,
see Section 14.2.5B).
Specific Standards
(1) Location Standards
Facility clustering: if the Commission finds that a site,
structure, or building is well-suited to the location of a
facility, it may require the clustering of antenna mounts
in or on that site, structure, or building provided that all
facilities meet the requirements of this regulation.
Locations for facilities in descending order of preference
are as follows (see also Charts 1-3 in Section 14.2.16D):
(i) on existing or approved towers;
(ii) within existing structures (e.g., steeple, spires);
(iii) on existing structures (e.g., buildings, water
towers, and utility poles);
(iv) in non-sensitive areas; and
(v) in sensitive areas with mitigation.
The applicant shall show the Commission the applicant’s
plan or model for the coverage of all areas in the Town

of Windsor and the locations of all existing and proposed
towers that would provide that coverage.
The applicant shall show all facilities within Windsor and
within one mile of the Windsor Town line.
(2) Site Standards
All utilities serving the facility shall be underground.
Unless tower base equipment is located in underground
vaults or in an existing structure and no security fence is
required, the base area of a facility shall be large enough
to accommodate:
(i) the required tower base equipment, access drive
and parking for all carriers anticipated;
(ii) a screening and landscaping area at least 20 feet
wide around the outside of the security fence
perimeter or the area around the smallest
rectangle that can encompass all tower base
equipment if no fencing is required. This area
shall be landscaped to screen the tower base
equipment or security fence from view. The
Commission may also require walls to achieve
the screening function especially where the
tower is close to a building located on the site
and the wall can be made to seem as an
extension of the building.
Except as provided below, a tower proposed as a groundmounted
facility shall have at least the fall zone distance
from any abutting property. A tower proposed as a
ground-mounted facility shall have at least two times the
fall zone distance from any abutting sensitive area if it is
determined to be not visible and at least three times the
fall zone from any sensitive area if it is determined to be
as visible.
Tower base equipment structures, cabinets, and fencing
of ground-mounted facilities shall not be located within
any required yard.
In order to evaluate the site for use as a wireless
telecommunications facility, the Commission may
require sections of the site and environs, balloon tests,

any application.
(3) Structural Standards
Unless otherwise specifically approved by the
Commission, all towers proposed under this Section shall
be monopoles.
Unless required by the FAA or otherwise specifically
approved by the Commission, the color of towers and
other visible facility equipment shall be a noncontrasting
blue or gray.
Unless required by the FAA, no lights shall be permitted
on any facility above 14 feet of the surrounding grade.
No signs other than those for safety or security directly
involving the operation of the facility shall be permitted.
To minimize tower proliferation, towers shall be
designed structurally to adequately carry the weight,
load/stress, and height to permit at least three additional
co-locators including a municipal antenna, unless
specifically waived by the Commission. To achieve this,
the tower may be designed for incremental height
expansion.
The maximum size of a tower-mounted dish antenna
shall be 3 feet in diameter. The maximum size of a panel
antenna shall be 2 feet by 6 feet (for ground or roofmounted
dish antennas, see Sections 4.4.11, 4.5.9, and
14.2.5B).
Except as provided below, roof-mounted facilities shall
not extend more than 10 feet above the maximum height
of the building and shall be located away from the roof
perimeter to minimize visibility from the ground.
Roof mounted antennas on existing buildings may
extend higher than 10 feet to no more than base height
on buildings in industrial or commercial areas if:
(i) no tower base equipment, cabinets, fences, or
screens are visible from streets or surrounding
properties;

(ii) the Commission finds that the proposal does not
significantly and negatively impact the area;
(iii) the Commission finds that the top of the roof is
not visible from a significant number of
locations; and;
(iv) the proposed structure is not within a sensitive
area.
(v) Antennas mounted on the facades of buildings
shall be designed and located to be compatible
with the color, materials, and overall appearance
of the existing building to the greatest extent
possible.
Application Process
(1) The application process for telecommunication facility siting shall
vary depending on height, area sensitivity, base visibility, and colocation
provisions, because of the significance of these factors
in determining impact levels. The review process necessary for
each wireless telecommunication facility location shall be
determined by using the three charts on the following page (for
use of charts, see † Directions). Where two or more sensitive
areas apply, the value from the most restrictive one shall be used:

(2) For a wireless telecommunication facility requiring a special use
application, the notification area shall be within 250 feet from
any property line of the proposed site.
(3) In addition to considerations, in evaluating a
wireless telecommunication facility requiring a special use
application, the Commission shall also consider the potential for
co-location, alternative site locations, feasible alternative
technologies, and cooperation by the applicant regarding the use
of the wireless telecommunication facility for Town emergency
communication services, except that consideration of renewals
shall be evaluated by Section 14.2.16B(9) only.
(4) Where a tower is prohibited, the Commission may reconsider
such prohibition by special use. Such reconsideration shall be
subject to all applicable requirements in Section 14.2.16 in
addition to the following:
a significant stand of evergreen trees whose
characteristics, including height, density, and area of
coverage, would allow the facility to blend in with the
surrounding trees;
the wireless telecommunication facility is constructed to
look like an evergreen tree and will have characteristics
that allow it to blend in with the surrounding trees;
a conservation easement shall be placed on the area
containing the stand of trees, which shall be preserved
and maintained by the applicant in a manner reasonably
assuring their long term survival; and
the impact by the facility on the sensitive area is minimal
and is outweighed by the need for the service the
wireless telecommunication facility provides.
(5) The use of a temporary or mobile wireless telecommunication
facility, sometimes known as Cell on Wheels (COW), based on
such factors as its size, the size of the site, its placement on the
site, potential safety impacts, and the degree that the temporary
or mobile wireless telecommunication facility does not
compromise the character of the surrounding area and generally
meets the intent of this regulation, may be approved as follows:
jointly by the Building Official and Town Planner allowed
under Section 3.9 for an initial period of up to three
months if they find that the temporary or mobile wireless
telecommunication facility has not created nuisances,

to extend such time of temporary facility operation; and
for each of the applications above, the fees shall be
calculated as in Section E below.
Fees
The application fees shall be calculated as follows:
(1) for telecommunication facilities permitted by right, there is no
application fee; and
(2) for all other telecommunication facilities not otherwise
permitted by right or renewals under Section 14.2.16B(10), the
application fee is the same as for a site plan application or Section
3.9 Technical and Minor Changes to a site plan application.
Protection of Pedestrian Entry Doors
In order to protect the health and safety of employees and the general
public, pedestrian entry doors for any building additions greater than
10,000 square feet that include pedestrian entry area(s) or new buildings
greater than 10,000 square feet must have an adequately sized protected
roof area (minimum 80 square feet if it is within the building’s foundation
and surrounded by at least 2 walls or 100 square feet if it is outside the
building’s foundation) that is part of and compatible with the main
structure in material and design. Fabric roof structure areas are
prohibited. The Commission may reduce the area requirement for
overhead cover by no more than 25% or allow the substitution of
automatic doors if justified by conditions such as the size of the building,
and/or leasable area served by the pedestrian entry door and/or the
orientation of the building relative to prevailing winds. Any roof required
under this section shall be exempt from the building to pavement setback
requirements of Section 3.1.2C(2).

Airport Interchange District
The intent of this Section is to provide flexibility in design for lots with
high visibility and access to the commercial corridors served by the major
intersections of the Bradley Airport Connector (Route 20) with
Poquonock Avenue (Route 75) and Kennedy/Old County Road. The
Commission recognizes that the convenient accessibility of these
interchanges to Bradley International Airport and the existing network of
restaurants and related services make lots in this District highly desirable
for hotels, corporate headquarters, and other related uses. Proposals
under this Section shall be considered as a special use.
For purposes of this Section, the Airport Interchange District shall be
defined as Business and Industrial Zones within 1,000 feet of the
intersections of Route 20 with Route 75 and Kennedy/Old County Road.
In order to encourage high-quality, appropriate development in this
District, the proposed facility must be found by the Commission to be
significant in size, conveniently located to the surrounding development
and other amenity facilities, of a high quality in terms of building and
landscape design standards, and in accordance with Section 15.1.3.
The minimum standards of the underlying zone shall apply, except as
modified below.
The minimum standards for hotels shall be as specified in Section 5.2.6F,
except for those specified below:
(1) maximum building height shall be 35 feet, except for properties
abutting Route 20, which shall have a height limitation of four
stories or 45 feet;
(2) minimum room size shall be 312 square feet;
(3) maximum density shall be 1,502 square feet per unit; and
(4) hotels proposed for this district may, but are not required to,
provide full-service restaurants, but shall provide other
amenities such as indoor pools, fitness centers, and meeting
rooms.

Alternative Energy Considerations
For Facilities within the Industrial Zone
(1) In order to provide efficient use and generation of energy, the
use of geothermal systems is encouraged. For every 10% of
heating requirement (as determined by the total building heating
load) 1% more of the site area can be covered by hard surface
above 50% (as per Section 14.1.6) for a maximum of 60%
impervious coverage. This shall be done as per Section 14.1.20C.
(2) In order to provide efficient use and generation of energy, the
use of photovoltaic panels is encouraged. Credit will be given for
photovoltaic panels placed on either the roof or walls (facing
within 30º of south). The impervious coverage of the site (as per
Section 14.1.6) may be increased based on the total area of the
qualifying panels divided by the roof area. For every 10% of the
calculated roof area, 1% more of the site can be covered by hard
surface above 50% (as per Section 14.1.6) for a maximum of 60%
impervious coverage. This shall be done as per Section 14.1.20A.
(3) If a combination of alternative energy systems are used for the
building, the maximum impervious coverage shall not exceed
60%.
NON-CONFORMING LOTS, NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND,
NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES, AND NON-CONFORMING
USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES
(1) Intent
Where lots, structures, and uses of land and structures lawfully existed
before the effective date of adoption or amendment of these
Regulations, but are prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms
of these Regulations, it is the intent of these Regulations to permit these
non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to
encourage their survival.
Non-Conforming Lots
Except as per Section 8-26a(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes, in all
single-family zones, any lot approved by the Commission and shown on a
subdivision plan on file in the Windsor Town Clerk's Office or separately
described in the latest deed of record prior to the effective date of these
Regulations that does not meet the minimum lot area and/or lot width

This exception shall not apply to any substandard lot where sufficient
adjoining land that was under the same ownership as of September 14,
1987, can be combined to reduce the lot area and/or lot width noncompliance.
Non-Conforming Uses of Land
Where the lawful use of land existed at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of these Regulations that is no longer permissible under the
current provisions of these Regulations, such use may be continued as
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
No non-conforming use shall be enlarged to occupy a greater area of land
than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
these Regulations.
Any non-conforming use of land may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that, following a public hearing, the
Commission determines that the proposed use is equally or more
appropriate in the district than the existing non-conforming use. In
permitting such change, the Commission may require appropriate
conditions to protect the public in accordance with these Regulations.
No non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot occupied by the use at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of these Regulations.
Any non-conforming use of land that is superseded by a permitted use
shall not be resumed.
If a non-conforming use of land is abandoned by virtue of an overt act by
the property owner (such as the removal of structures, signs, or other
appurtenances associated with the non-conforming use; a change to a
conforming use; or by written notification to the Town), any subsequent
use of that land shall conform to the requirements specified by these
Regulations for the underlying zoning district.

Non-Conforming Use of Structures
If a lawful use of a structure existed at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of these Regulations that would not be allowed in the district
under the current provisions of these Regulations, the lawful use may be
continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by these Regulations
in the underlying zone shall be enlarged, moved, or structurally altered in
a manner that increases the nonconformity, except in changing the use
of the structure to a use permitted in the underlying zone.
Any non-conforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that following a public hearing, the Commission
determines that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate in the
district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change,
the Commission may require appropriate conditions to protect the public
in accordance with these Regulations.
Any non-conforming use of a structure that is superseded by a permitted
use shall not be resumed.
When a non-conforming use of a structure is abandoned by virtue of an
overt act by the property owner such as the removal of structures, signs,
or other appurtenances associated with the non-conforming use; a
change to a conforming use; or by written notification to the Town, the
structure or structure and premises shall not be used, except in
compliance with the requirements of the underlying zone.
Non-Conforming Structures
Where a lawful structure existed at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of these Regulations that could not be built under the
current provisions of these Regulations by reason of restrictions on area,
coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such non-conforming structure may remain as long as
it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions.
No non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that
increases its non-conformity.

SPECIAL USES
INTENT
The development and execution of a comprehensive zoning regulation is
based on the division of the Town into districts where the use of the land
and structures and the bulk and location of structures in relation to the
land within are substantially uniform. There are certain uses and features
that, due to their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly classified or
regulated in a district(s) without consideration of the impact of such uses
and features on neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared
with the public need for them at their intended locations. Such uses and
features are classified as special uses and are regulated as follows.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Public Hearing
Where provided for in these Regulations, the Commission may, in
appropriate cases, grant special uses after a public hearing in accordance
with Section 16.3.
Extensions, Alterations, or Changes
Where an existing use that is allowed only as a special use is proposed to
be extended or substantially altered in a manner that in any way changes
the character or intensity of the use, such proposed extension,
substantial change, or alteration shall be treated as a special use under
this Section. Any special use that is changed to another special use shall
require a new application and a public hearing.
Considerations
Special uses shall be granted only where the Commission finds that the
proposed use, extension, substantial alteration or change of an existing
use is in accord with the public convenience, health, safety, and welfare
after taking into account, where appropriate:
the nature of the proposed site, including its size and shape and the
proposed size, shape, character, and arrangement of proposed structures
and landscaping;
the resulting congestion, vehicular, and pedestrian circulation and
adequacy of the street system and other public facilities;

the nature of the surrounding area and the extent that the proposed use
or feature will be in harmony with it;
the public need of the proposed use or uses on the proposed site at the
time of application;

when evaluating a reapproval of a special use, the history of compliance
with any previous conditions or safeguards and demonstrated
performance during the term of the previous approval with respect to
the considerations of A through F above.
Conditions
In granting any special use, the Commission may attach additional or
more stringent standards than are required for permitted uses in order
to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and the surrounding area
and may include, but are not limited to, the following.
Required yards, parking, landscaping, screening, green area ratio, etc.,
greater than the minimum required by these Regulations.
Required signs, height, and size of buildings, etc., smaller than the
maximum allowed by these Regulations or other applicable codes or
regulations.
Modification of the exterior features or appearance of any building or
structure where necessary to be in harmony with the surrounding area
and not detract from property values.

use shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 3 unless
additional, more stringent requirements are imposed by the Commission
as per . For special uses that utilize existing floor area (built
prior to February 2, 1993) on currently developed B-1 and B-2 sites in
Windsor Center, its Fringe Areas, and the Wilson Study Area (south of the
Putnam Highway), as depicted in the Plan of Conservation and
Development (see Appendix, pages A-28 and A-29), the Commission may
waive any minimum or maximum requirement, with the exception of
parking, if it determines that such a waiver does not adversely affect
public health, safety, welfare, or nearby property values (for parking
reductions see Section 15.2.7).

INTERPRETATION AND
DEFINTIIONS
Reduced Parking Requirements
In order to minimize paved surfaces and eliminate the need to construct
unnecessary parking spaces, the Commission may reduce the cumulative
minimum parking requirements within a mixed-use development if the
applicant conducts a parking study (based on empirical field data or
similar data gathered by surveys by the American Planning Association,
Institute of Transportation Engineers, or similar organizations) that
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that one or more of
the following conditions exist to warrant the reduction:
(1) differences in the timing of peak parking demands among
existing and/or proposed uses result in a net-peak parking
demand that is significantly lower than the cumulative minimum
parking requirements;
(2) synergistic relationships among uses create captive markets,
resulting in multiple purpose walking trips within the
development; and/or
(3) the development is likely to generate bus, bicycle, or pedestrian
trips and accommodations exist or are proposed to support these
alternative modes of transportation.
If any use of the property changes at any time, this approval shall become
invalid unless re-approved for the new use.
Transfer of Non-Residential Coverage
In order to preserve land with historic, ecologic, aesthetic, agricultural, or
recreational value or potential, the Commission may allow impervious
coverage permitted by these Regulations on a parcel (the "sending
parcel") within any non-residential zone to be transferred and added to
the authorized impervious coverage of another parcel (the "receiving
parcel") within any non-residential zone. The Commission must find that
the transfer will better promote the health, safety, convenience, and
general welfare of the community in a manner that will likely outweigh
the adverse impacts of increased development density on the receiving
parcel.
(1) Among the factors that the Commission shall consider in its
findings are:
the location of the sending parcel and public access to it,
if it is used for recreational or cultural purposes;

the existing value or potential value of the sending parcel
for historic preservation, as a nature preserve, as an
aesthetic asset, as open space, as a recreational amenity,
or as agricultural land; and
whether the transfer of impervious coverage is
preferable to conventional development of the parcels
involved.
(2) The amount of impervious coverage that may be transferred shall
not exceed the amount of developable land contained within the
sending parcel or 50 percent of the sending parcel, whichever is
least. The resulting amount shall be added to the authorized
impervious coverage on the receiving parcel, allowing a
maximum impervious coverage of no more than 67 percent on
the receiving parcel. Portions of impervious coverage that
cannot fit on the receiving parcel may remain with the sending
parcel.
(3) The applicant may elect not to apply for site plan approval at the
time of application for this special use, but shall submit a concept
plan to demonstrate the feasibility of the transfer and to identify
the receiving parcel. If a site plan is not submitted at the time of
application for this special use, the Commission shall apply the
considerations in Section 15.1.3 and may apply other standards
of Section 15.1.4 when it reviews the site plan submitted.
(4) The sending parcel shall be dedicated to the Town as provided in
Section 14.1.21 or to another grantee acceptable to the
Commission, such as the State of Connecticut, a land trust,
wildlife association, or other nonprofit entity, whose main
purpose is to convey a public benefit.
(5) At the time of site plan approval, the Commission may grant
waivers of the requirements of Section 3 of these Regulations
when strict application of those requirements would prohibit full
use of the impervious coverage transferred. However, the
Commission may not grant waivers of Section 3 requirements for
parking spaces, buffers, yards, pavement setbacks, and
landscaped end islands in order to promote safety within parking
areas and better protect the value of abutting property. The
Commission may condition the waivers on the type of use the
applicant shows in its site plan and may require a new application
under Section 15.1.2 before a substantially different use may be
made of the parcel.
(6) Approval of the transfer shall not be effective until the applicant
has conveyed the sending parcel in accordance with the approval

and has filed a certificate on the Windsor Land Records that
contains legal descriptions of the parcels involved, identifies the
sending and receiving parcels, and states the amount of
impervious coverage transferred. Filing of the certificate shall
prevent this special use from expiring as it shall stand in lieu of
the Section 15.1.7 requirements for a Building Permit or
Certificate of Occupancy.
(7) The Commission may reverse the transfer of impervious
coverage upon a joint petition of the owners of the sending
parcel and the receiving parcel. To provide notice of the reversal,
the owners shall file a certificate on the Windsor Land Records
similar to that required in Subsection (6) above.
(8) Where the sending or receiving parcel lie in several zones or the
applicant has designated several parcels as sending parcels or
receiving parcels, the requirements of this Section may be read

covered by roofs and paving.
Adaptive Re-Use of Underutilized Buildings of Historic or
Architectural Significance
The adaptive re-use of underutilized buildings of historic or architectural
significance is allowed under the following provisions:
(1) the building is of architectural and/or historic significance, is
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is
unsuitable and unused for the original purpose that it is zoned
for;
(2) the existing character of any building involved will not be
substantially changed;
(3) the building(s) and/or site will be rehabilitated in accordance
with The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation
and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings;
(4) the proposed uses and development shall be located in an area
where traffic volumes of adjacent streets make the property
more adaptable to commercial uses, the surrounding area is
commercial in nature, and the uses will not have excessive
harmful impact on the immediate surrounding area;

INTERPRETATION AND
DEFINTIIONS
Upon a request for relief from a provision of an approved
form-based regulation, the Town Planner and Zoning
Enforcement Officer, at their discretion, shall determine
whether an administrative warrant or a variance is
required.
The Town Planner and Zoning Enforcement Officer may
jointly issue an administrative warrant when the
applicant has demonstrated and the Town Planner and
Zoning Enforcement Officer, in consultation with
relevant Town Staff, find that:
(i) special conditions exist that are peculiar to the
land or structure involved but not elsewhere in
the design development district or transect
zone, which preclude the property from meeting
the requirements of the form-based regulation;
(ii) the peculiar and unusual physical character of
the property is not the result of the applicant’s
actions;
(iii) the request is in harmony with the stated intent
of Section 13.2.8A and the approved concept
plan;
(iv) the request, if granted, will not negatively impact
public health, safety, or welfare;
(v) the request constitutes a minor change that does
not significantly alter the character or intensity
of the proposed development;
(vi) a literal interpretation of the form-based
regulations would deprive the applicant of rights
enjoyed by other property owners in the same
district or zone; and
(vii) granting the warrant will not bestow any special
privilege on the applicant that is denied to other
property owners in the design development
district or transect zone.
When a warrant is granted, the Town Planner shall place
a note on the record plan identifying the reason(s) why
regulatory relief was granted.

When the Town Planner and Zoning Enforcement Officer
determine that a request for relief from a form-based
regulation requires a variance, the applicant may apply
for a variance in accordance with Section 16.9.4, except
as provided in subsection (f) below. Such determination
by the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall not be
considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals as an Appeal
of Order.
Warrants and variances shall be considered unique and
shall not set precedent for similar requests for regulatory
relief.
Warrants and variances shall not be granted for:
(i) uses not permitted within a transect zone;
(ii) the maximum dimensions of traffic lanes;
(iii) the required provision of rear alleys/lanes, if any;
(iv) residential densities;
(v) permission to build accessory dwelling units;
(vi) parking location requirements; and
(vii) changes to an approved concept plan.
(3) No Building Permit shall be issued for a single-family home within
a Traditional Neighborhood Design Development without
certification by the Planning Department that it meets all
applicable requirements of the approved form-based regulation.
Decision Considerations
The Commission shall act on any design development application.
On a design development application involving notice to adjoining
municipalities or notice to CRCOG under Section 16.1.8, the Commission
shall consider any report or testimony received prior to or during a
required public hearing.
In order to approve any Design Development application, the

Following Approval
Prior to the issuance of any Building Permits, all public improvements or
similar common elements in private portions of a development (e.g.,
streets, sidewalks, storm drainage facilities, street lights) shall be
completed or the developer may complete those improvements that are
necessary to support the development and protect the public health,
safety, and welfare of prospective property owners (e.g., the base course
of pavement, storm drainage facilities, fire hydrants) and post a
performance bond for the balance of the improvements in accordance
with Section 16.1.11. When a development is phased into a number of
self-supporting phases, only those public improvements or similar
common elements necessary to support a particular phase shall be
completed or bonded, as required above.
Prior to the start of excavation or construction, a performance bond shall
be posted to ensure compliance with a certified Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan developed according to the minimum standards
outlined in “Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control,” as amended, to prevent excessive erosion and sedimentation
and to guarantee grading and seeding of rough-graded, unsightly areas if
construction ceases for an extended period of time.
Regardless of the requirements and provisions of Section 16.7.5A, no
Building Permit shall be issued until sewer and water system plans have
been approved by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) and all
other requirements of the MDC have been met.
Expiration and Completion
The Commission shall choose a major building, buildings, or phase that
Building Permits shall be applied for within one year of the approval of
the detailed plan. If a Building Permit application has not been submitted
by the applicant for the required building(s) and an extension has not
been granted by the Commission as provided for in Subsection D below,
the concept plan and detailed plan approvals shall become invalid.
The Commission shall choose a major building, buildings, or phase that a
Subdvision or site plan shall be applied for within one year of the approval
of a form-based regulation. If a subdivision or site plan application has
not been submitted by the applicant for the required building(s) or phase
and an extension has not been granted by the Commission as provided

cease until the Commission reviews and re-approves the project to
ensure compliance with current standards. Should a subdvision or site
plan approval become invalid, the related form-based regulation shall
remain in full force and effect for any existing development.
The Commission may extend the time period requirements of Sections
16.7.1C1(c) and 16.7.1D(3) and 16.7.6A and 16.7.6B for up to one year

construction, size or designated use of a building for which plans
and application(s) were on file with the Building Official no more
than six months prior to the effective date of these Regulations
or any amendment thereto and the construction of which shall

by the Building Official stating that the premises or building
complies with all the provisions of these Regulations. A
Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued for any development
not in compliance with these Regulations. Such Certificate is also
required for any change, extension or alteration in a use. After
notification from the permittee that the premises are ready for
occupancy or use, the Building Official shall have ten days within
which to approve or disapprove the permittee's previously filed
application for a Certificate of Occupancy.
(2) All work shall be performed in compliance with approved plans.
Unauthorized changes to approved plans may cause the
approved plans to be invalidated. If the Building Official or ZEO
finds that extensive unauthorized changes have occurred, he/she
may invalidate the approved plans and proceed in accordance

required, can be properly installed;
(5) certification that required yard drains are in place; and
(6) the location of any required sidewalk to be installed and
indication that the developer has rights to access the lot to install
sidewalks.
If any of the above requirements are not in conformance with the
approved plan, the applicant shall undertake whatever measures are
necessary to bring them into conformance. Any change in the grading or
elevations that might affect drainage shall be approved by the Town
Engineer. The above plan shall be stamped by a Registered Land
Surveyor. In order to prevent unnecessary hardship in connection with
small alterations and expansions, the Town Engineer and the Zoning

Section 1
Title and Authority
1.1 The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the State have been endowed. The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal, aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetland and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of material, the diversion or obstruction of waterflow, the erection of structures and other uses, all of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the State of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the State. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens of the State by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the State, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.
1.2 These regulations shall be known as the "Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Windsor, Connecticut."
1.3 The Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission of the Town of Windsor was established in accordance with an ordinance adopted March 4, l974 and shall implement the purposes and provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act in the Town of Windsor. 4
1.4 These regulations have been adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and these regulations.
1.5 The Agency shall enforce all provisions of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act and shall issue, issue with terms, conditions, limitations or modifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in the Town of Windsor pursuant to Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended.

1. Conservation Commission 21
2. Planning, Zoning, or Planning or Zoning Commissions
3. Building Official
4. Health Officer
5. Town Engineer
c. The Agency may also consider comments on any application from the North Central Connecticut Conservation District, the Capitol Region Council of Governments, or other regional organizations (i.e., Connecticut River Watershed Council); agencies in adjacent municipalities that may be affected by the proposed activity, or other technical agencies or organizations that may undertake additional studies or investigations.
d. Non-receipt of comments from agencies and commissions listed in subsections 10.1b and c above within the prescribed time shall neither delay nor prejudice the decision of the Agency.
e. For an application for which a public hearing is held, public
comments, evidence and testimony.
10.2 Criteria of Decision.In carrying out the purposes and policies of Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes, including matters relating to regulating, licensing and enforcing of the provisions thereof, the Agency shall take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances, including but not limited to:
a. The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses.
b. The applicants' purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses.
c. The relationship between the short-term, long term and cumulative impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands and the maintenance and enhancement of long term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses .
d. Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by proposed regulated activity, including the extent to which such activity would foreclose a future ability to protect, enhance or restore such resources, and any mitigation measures which may be considered as a condition of issuing a permit for such activity including, but not limited to, measures to (1) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (2) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (3) in the following order of priority: restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources;
e. The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health, or the reasonable use of property, including abutting or downstream property, which would be caused or threatened by the proposed activity, or the creation of conditions which may do so. This includes recognition of potential damage from erosion, turbidity, or siltation, loss of fish and wildlife and their habitat, loss of unique habitat having demonstrable natural, scientific or 22
educational value, loss or diminution of beneficial aquatic organisms and wetland plants, the dangers of flooding and pollution, and the destruction of the economic, aesthetic, recreational and other public and private uses and values of wetlands and water- courses to the community.
f. Impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for which the activity is proposed and future activities associated with or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands or watercourses.
10.3 In the case of an application that received a public hearing pursuant to a finding by the Agency that the proposed activity may have a significant impact on wetlands or watercourses, a permit shall not be issued unless the Agency finds on the basis of the record that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist. In making this finding the Agency shall consider the facts and circumstances set forth in Subsection 10.2 of this section. The finding and the reasons therefore shall be stated on the record in writing.
10.4 In the case of an application which is denied on the basis of a finding that there may be feasible and prudent alternatives to the proposed regulated activity which have less adverse impact on wetland or watercourses, the Agency shall propose on the record in writing the types of alternatives which the applicant may investigate provided this subsection shall not be construed to shift the burden from the applicant to prove that he is entitled to the permit or to present alternatives to the proposed regulated activity.
10.5 For purposes of this section, (1) “wetlands or watercourses “ includes aquatic, plant or animal life and habitats in wetlands or watercourses, and (2) “habitats” means areas or environments in which an organism or biological population normally lives or occurs.
10.6 A municipal inland wetlands agency shall not deny or condition an application for a regulated activity in an area outside wetlands or watercourses on the basis of an impact or effect on aquatic, plant or animal life unless such activity will likely impact or affect the physical characteristics of such wetlands or watercourses.
10.7 In reaching its decision on any application after a public hearing, the Agency shall base its decision on the record of that hearing. Documentary evidence or other material not in the hearing record shall not be considered by the Agency in its decision. A conclusion that a feasible and prudent alternative does not exist does not create a presumption that a permit should be issued. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating that this application is consistent with the purposes and policies of these regulations and Sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes. 23
10.8 In the case of an application where the applicant has provided written notice pursuant to subsection 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations, the holder of the restriction may provide proof to the inland wetlands agency that granting of the permit application will violate the terms of the restriction. Upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction, the inland wetlands agency shall not grant the permit approval.
10.9 In the case of an application where the applicant fails to comply with the
provisions of subsections 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations, (1) the party holding the conservation or preservation restriction, other than a state agency that holds such restriction, may, not later than fifteen days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with the inland wetlands agency, subject to the rules and regulations of such agency relating to appeals. The inland wetlands agency shall reverse the permit approval upon a finding that the requested land use violates the terms of such restriction; or (2) the state agency that holds such restriction may, not later than thirty days after receipt of actual notice of permit approval, file an appeal with the inland wetlands agency, subject to the rules and regulations of such agency relating to appeals.
10.10 Nothing in subsections 7.11c or 7.11d of these regulations shall be
construed to prohibit the filing of a permit application or to require such written notice when the activity that is the subject of such permit application will occur on a portion of property that is not restricted under the terms of such conservation or preservation restriction.

steep or erodible slopes; or any other condition determined by the Commission to make the
land unfit for building purposes, shall not be approved for subdivisions unless the
Commission is satisfied that the proposed engineering of the site will eliminate such
hazards without substantially altering the character of the land.
3.5.4 The Commission may impose reasonable and necessary modifications to subdivision plans
at the time of their approval.
3.5.5 Where it is necessary to discharge water from a public right-of-way across private lands not
included in the subdivision, the developer shall obtain an easement from the owners of the
affected property granting the right to permanently discharge water across their property,
and shall submit copies of the easement to the Commission prior to subdivision approval.
3.5.6 Where it is necessary to drain a public street across lands included in the subdivision, the
plans shall provide an easement for the discharge of water in favor of the Town of Windsor.
The location of such easements shall be satisfactory to the Commission.
3.5.7 Metal boundary-marker pins shall be permanently established at the corners of each lot. If
it is impractical to establish pins at a corner, reference pins shall be established on the lot
line as close as possible to the corner.
3.5.8 Metal boundary-marker pins shall be permanently established to define all easements.
3.5.9 All survey work and monumentation shall be conducted under the supervision of a
Professional Land Surveyor licensed in the State of Connecticut and in accordance with the
Standards for Surveys and Maps in the State of Connecticut, adopted September 26, 1996,
or as amended.
3.6 ACCESS TO LOTS AND ADJOINING LANDS
Land shall not be subdivided in a way that unreasonably restricts the future subdivision of adjoining
lands.
3.6.1 There shall be direct access to each lot from a public or private street.
3.6.2 There shall be access to a public or private street(s) provided by a street-width reserve
parcel(s) to ensure access into and allow future subdivision of adjoining land. The location
of the access reserve parcel(s) shall be determined by the Commission and shall be
designated as a future street on all subdivision plans. The Commission may require the
developer to deed or otherwise give rights to any reserve parcels to the Town.
3.6.3 Spite strips created for the express purpose of denying access between adjoining land and a
public or private street are prohibited.
3.7 OPEN SPACES
3.7.1 General Requirements. The Commission shall require that no less than 15 percent of the
total area of a subdivision be dedicated to the Town of Windsor, in accordance with Section
14.1.21 of the Windsor Zoning Regulations, as public open space, parks, and/or
playgrounds when and in places determined appropriate by the Commission. All areas of
open space shall be shown on the subdivision plan along with the construction of any
Section 3.7
3-3
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
facilities/improvements by the applicant as required by the Commission. The applicant
may request that the Commission consider open space in remote locations of the same
ownership as the land being subdivided, subject to the applicable requirements of Section
3.7. The voluntary donation or preservation of additional land in excess of the
requirements of this Section may be approved by the Commission if it is found to be in the
Town’s best interest. This additional land may be proposed for dedication to the Town of
Windsor or to any private non-profit conservation organization, including homeowners’
associations.
3.7.2 Fees in Lieu of Open Space. Recognizing that the dedication of open space land may not
be desirable or appropriate in all situations, and in fairness to all applicants, the
Commission may instead accept a fee or any combination of land and fee by applying the
following conditions and procedures:
A The fee, or combination of land and fee, shall not exceed ten percent of the fair
market value of the land prior to subdivision.
B The fee shall be placed in a fund to be used for preserving open space or acquiring
additional land for open space or for recreational or agricultural purposes.
3.7.3 The subdivider shall indicate on the application and subdivision plans whether land, a fee
in-lieu of open space, or a combination of land and fee is being proposed. Exemptions
under Section 3.7.7 shall also be indicated on the application and subdivision plans.
A The Commission shall examine each proposal and may accept, reject, or modify each
proposal based on, but not limited to, the following criteria: the land’s size, shape,
location, and public access; the conservation and protection of wildlife and natural or
scenic resources including lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, riparian areas, inland
wetlands, aquifers, and woodlands; the protection of historic and archeological sites;
the presence, absence, or expansion of any existing open spaces, parks, or
playgrounds in the neighborhood; and/or the Plan of Conservation and Development
objectives.
B The percentage of wetlands, steeply sloped areas in excess of 25 percent, and areas
designated as a Special Flood Hazard Area within the required open space area shall
not exceed that of the entire subdivision.
3.7.4 Land Appraisal. The fair market value of the land prior to subdivision shall be determined
by an appraiser chosen jointly by the applicant and the Commission (or its designee) at the
applicant’s expense. If agreed to by the applicant and the Commission, an alternative
method of determining total payment is a fee of $3,000 per lot.
3.7.5 Payment. Any fees in-lieu of open space may be paid in full prior to filing final mylar
plans with the Town Clerk or shall be paid at the time of first sale or transfer of each
individual lot, on a prorated basis as described in Section 8-25(a) of the Connecticut
General Statutes. The prorated fees due to the Town of Windsor shall constitute a first lien
on each individual lot and shall be reflected on the Land Records of the Town. Such liens
shall be released upon receipt of payment by the Town of Windsor. The attorney for the
applicant shall provide the Town Planning and Zoning Commission with a certificate of
title assuring the Town Attorney and the Commission that the Town has a first lien on the
Section 3.8

A minor street that mainly serves residences in a neighborhood. All new local streets
in a residential zone, whether public or private, shall be constructed with a minimum
right-of-way width of 50 feet and a minimum road width of 28 feet, unless reduced in
width under Section 3.8.3.
Section 3.8
3-5
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
E The Commission shall determine the classification of all streets proposed as part of a
new subdivision.
3.8.2 Notice of Intent to Construct a Street
The construction of a new street or any part of a new street shall not begin until the
contractor has notified the Town Engineer in writing.
3.8.3 Design Criteria for New Streets
The design of new streets shall be based on the following:
A Unless requirements and/or standards are specifically waived by the Commission
under these Regulations, all public and private streets shall be constructed under the
requirements of the Town of Windsor Engineering Standards and Specifications.
B The arrangement of streets in all subdivisions shall ensure that the continuity of
streets is maintained to provide adequate traffic circulation. If the subdivision is
proposed in an area where the Commission has adopted a street plan, the
arrangements of streets shall conform to the adopted plan.
C Where a subdivision contains lots that front on an existing road or street, the existing
road or street shall have adequate right-of-way width, suitable road surface, and
suitable drainage for increased traffic.
D Streets shall intersect as near as possible at right angles (90 degrees) and no street
shall intersect any other street at less than a sixty-degree angle.
E Multiple street intersections where more than one street converges with another
street to intersect at the same intersection or in close proximity to another intersection
are prohibited.
Examples of Prohibited Intersection Configurations
F The total length of any combination of cul-de-sacs and/or loop streets shall not
exceed 850 feet, as measured along the center line of the right-of-way of these streets
from their point of intersection with the center line of the adjacent through street to
the point where the right-of-way begins to flare into the turnabout circle or loop of
Section 3.8
3-6
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
these streets unless a greater length is authorized by the Commission because of
adverse topographical conditions, difficult site configuration, future road extension,
or other good cause. All cul-de-sac streets shall contain a turnabout circle at the end
of the street. If a cul-de-sac street is intended to be extended at a future date, the
turnabout circle or loop shall be constructed with a street right-of-way width stub
extension. The turnabout circle of a cul-de-sac extending beyond the 50-foot rightof-
way shall be located on an easement in favor of the Town of Windsor, which shall
be restored to lawn and driveway by any developer extending the street, and released
by the Town of Windsor to the owners.
Cul-de-sac Diagram
G No cul-de-sac or loop street shall be approved if there is sufficient land and suitable
terrain to allow the street to be extended to connect with another street in the
subdivision.
H All required street monumentation shall be installed prior to the construction of any
buildings. If the subdivision is to be developed in phases, the required street
monumentation for a particular phase shall be installed prior the construction of any
buildings within that phase.
I In the event that a building is constructed prior to the completion of the adjoining
street, that building shall not receive a Certificate of Occupancy unless the Town
Engineer or his authorized representative approves a partially constructed street
finished to at least a processed aggregate base condition and the required
performance surety for the completion of the street is in place.
J Street name signs shall be installed at the developer’s expense in accordance with the
Town of Windsor Engineering Standards and Specifications.
K Traffic signs shall be installed at the developer’s expense as required by the Town’s
Legal Traffic Authority and in accordance with the Town of Windsor Engineering
Standards and Specifications.
L The approval and filing of a subdivision plan does not constitute acceptance of any
public street, park, open space, or other improvement by the Town of Windsor, or in
the case of private streets and improvements, acceptance by a homeowners’
association.
Section 3.8
3-7
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
M The Town Council, or a homeowners’ association in the case of private
improvements, will only accept streets, parks, open space, and other improvements
after all requirements of the Commission have been met. The owner of a proposed
subdivision shall be required to deed to the Town of Windsor and/or a homeowners’
association all streets, parks, and other proposed public lands in the subdivision.
N If the applicant provides adequate justification in accordance with Section 5.3.1I, the
Commission may permit street pavement width reductions for the development of
nine or less residential units on a non-extendable cul-de-sac or loop street with posted
on-street parking restrictions and at least four off-street parking spaces per dwelling
unit provided by residential driveways in front of the dwelling unit or garage and/or
designated off-street parking areas. The Commission may allow a pavement width
reduction to a minimum of 24 feet, measured between the curbing. The design of the
street shall otherwise be in accordance with the Town of Windsor Engineering
Standards and Specifications.
3.8.4 Design Criteria for New Sidewalks
A Unless waived by the Commission under Section 3.8.4(F), sidewalks shall be
required on all proposed streets, and when a new street is proposed, sidewalks shall
be required along the frontage of the existing intersecting street.
B All sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the Town of Windsor
Engineering Standards and Specifications.
C In the interest of pedestrian safety, when a subdivision has frontage on an arterial
street, as identified in the Windsor 2004 Plan of Conservation and Development,
sidewalks shall be required on both sides of the street. The developer shall only be
responsible for the sidewalk along their frontage on the side of the street contiguous
to the proposed development. Sidewalks beyond the frontage of the proposed
development and on the opposite side of the street shall be provided as those
properties are developed or as the Town may provide at its discretion.
D When a subdivision has frontage on a collector street, as identified in the Windsor
2004 Plan of Conservation and Development, sidewalks shall be required on only one
side of the street. Based on the current location of sidewalks in the vicinity, as well
as plans and other information provided by the Town Engineer and Town Planner,
the Commission shall determine which side of a collector street is the most
appropriate side for the installation of sidewalks. If required, the developer shall only
be responsible for sidewalks along the frontage of their proposed development.
Sidewalks beyond the frontage of the proposed development or on the opposite side
of the street shall be provided as those properties are developed or as the Town may
provide at its discretion.
E In Windsor Center, its fringe areas, and the Wilson Study Area (south of Interstate
291), as depicted in the Windsor 2004 Plan of Conservation and Development, the
Commission may require increased sidewalk widths and the use of alternative paving
materials such as brick or stone, in keeping with a shopping street environment.
Section 3.9
3-8
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
F In accordance with Section 5.3.1I following a written request for a waiver by the
applicant and a two-thirds vote of the Commission, the Commission may waive the
requirement for sidewalks on existing or proposed streets under the following
conditions where applicable:
1. the width of a proposed street shall not be waived below 28 feet and the width
of a cul-de-sac shall not be waived below 26 feet; and
2. one or more of the following conditions exist:
a. the street is a non-extendable cul-de-sac serving six dwelling units or
less; or
b. the provision of a sidewalk would cause significant environmental harm
to adjacent wetlands or wildlife habitat; or
c. the provision of a sidewalk poses significant engineering challenges; or
d. a sidewalk already exists on the opposite side of an existing local or
collector street, as identified in the Windsor 2004 Plan of Conservation
and Development; or
e. the provision of a second sidewalk along an arterial street, as identified
in the Windsor 2004 Plan of Conservation and Development, is not
warranted due to the low density of current and future development
combined with a relatively low volume of traffic; or
f. the area is zoned business or industrial and a bituminous concrete path of
eight feet in width or greater in an alternate location is preferable to a
standard sidewalk. The design of such a path shall be approved by the
Town Engineer.
3.9 ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION
3.9.1 All engineering and construction shall be in accordance with the Town of Windsor
Engineering Standards and Specifications.
3.9.2 In the event that it is difficult to meet the required standards, the applicant shall obtain
approval for any modification from the Town Engineer or his authorized representative,
and shall describe the modification in his application.
3.9.3 The construction in the field shall be in accordance with the plans approved by the
Commission, except that minor field changes may be authorized by the Town Engineer or
his authorized representative.
3.9.4 The land on all side and rear lot lines of all lots shall be graded by the owner/developer in
accordance with the approved grading plan to provide for adequate drainage of surface
water. No change to the grading on the ground or the grading plan may be made by anyone

violation. A note to this effect shall be placed upon the subdivision plan and the grading
plan recorded on the land records.
3.9.5 Post-construction stormwater management shall be designed and permitted in accordance
with the Town’s Stormwater Management Ordinance, Chapter 3, Article IX, of the Windsor
Code of Ordinances.
3.9.6 Post-construction stormwater management improvements, including those necessary for the
Town’s storm drainage system, shall be paid for by the developer of the subdivision.
3.9.7 When the storm drainage system is constructed prior to house construction and sidewalks
are proposed, all proposed piping onto building lots shall be installed to a point not less
than six feet within the lot.
3.9.8 The construction in the field shall be carried on with a minimum of nuisance to the general
public, and effective measures shall be taken to reduce the hazards of dust and flooding.
3.9.9 Safety measures shall be implemented during construction to protect the public against
hazards that may be caused by construction machinery and heavy equipment, earthmoving,
eroding slopes, excavated holes, and similar construction works.
3.9.10 Erosion and sediment control measures shall be planned and permitted in accordance with
the Town’s Erosion & Sediment Control Ordinance, Chapter 3, Article VIII, of the Windsor
Code of Ordinances.
3.9.11 Proposed development shall meet all provisions of the Town’s Floodplain Management
Ordinance, Chapter 3, Article III, of the Windsor Code of Ordinances.

removal of trees shall be held to a minimum. The developer shall leave not less than two
naturally growing trees in the front yard of each lot, or shall plant two major deciduous
trees in the front yard of each lot.
3.10.2 Plantings shall not include invasive species specified in Public Act No. 04-203, as
amended. Preference shall be given to native species that are similar in appearance and
function to a non-native species whenever possible.
3.10.3 All watercourses shall be protected during construction of the subdivision and shall be left
in a condition satisfactory to the Town Engineer or his authorized representative.
3.10.4 No watercourse shall be disturbed, rerouted, or otherwise altered unless approved by the
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission.
Section 3.11
3-10
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
3.11 SANITARY SEWER
3.11.1 Sanitary sewers shall be installed to serve all lots in any residential subdivision containing
lots less than one acre. In all other residential subdivisions containing lots of one acre or
more, the Commission shall require sanitary sewers if any part of a proposed lot:
A has topographic or geologic conditions such as ledge, or slopes exceeding 10 percent,
which may cause septic tank effluent to leach from the ground;
B is a wetland identified in the field by a certified soil scientist or designated on the
official Town of Windsor Wetland Map;
C is designated as a Special Flood Hazard Area;
D is within a streambelt as delineated by the Soil Conservation Service; and/or
E is over an aquifer and has a potential value as a water supply or drains into water
bodies having recreational potential.
3.11.2 In all commercial and industrial subdivisions, the Commission may require sanitary sewers
if any of the conditions mentioned in Section 3.11.1 are applicable.
3.11.3 If a developer constructs a subdivision with a sanitary sewer system and constructs
structures for occupancy prior to connection of that system to the MDC sewer system, the
developer shall obtain approval from the MDC to seal the subdivision’s sanitary sewer
system, creating a capped sewer, rendering the system unusable until connected to the
MDC sewer system.
3.11.4 A subdivision with capped sewers shall contain soil suitable for private septic systems and
shall comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing their use.
3.11.5 The use of all private septic systems shall be discontinued within one year of the capped
sewer being unsealed and connected to the public sewer system unless any of the
conditions noted in Section 3.11.1 are applicable, in which case the affected septic systems
shall be discontinued within 90 days.
3.11.6 The sewage generated from structures provided with a capped sewer system may be
disposed of by means of a collective or communal system of treatment and disposal,
provided that the system is approved by the Connecticut Department of Public Health, the
MDC, the Town of Windsor Health Department, or any other state or local agency that may
have jurisdiction. A community sewage treatment plant shall only be considered temporary
and shall not be used longer than 90 days after the MDC reports that the related trunk
system is usable.
3.11.7 When sanitary sewers are constructed prior to structure construction, the building sewers to
serve each lot in the subdivision shall be installed to a point not less than six feet within
each lot.
Section 3.12
3-11
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
3.11.8 When a structure is built in a subdivision containing capped sewers, the building sewer
shall be connected to the building drain, which shall be installed to a point inside the
building where it can be easily connected to the drain vent stack when the sewers are
uncapped in the future. The building drain shall be capped to prevent it from being used
until the capped sewer system is connected to the MDC sewer system. The building drain
shall not be an obstruction in the basement, and shall be arranged so that the basement floor
will not be disturbed when connection of the building drain and vent stack is made in the
future.
3.12 PUBLIC WATER UTILITY PROVISION
3.12.1 All residential subdivisions shall be served by MDC water lines.
3.12.2 All lots within a residential subdivision shall be served with a lateral water line, installed
after the main water line has been sterilized. The lateral water line shall be installed to a
point not less than 12 inches within the lot.
3.12.3 The lateral water line shall enter the lot at the approximate center of the lot frontage, unless
an existing house foundation requires a water line in a different location.
3.12.4 Water lines shall be constructed in a straight line from the water line stop-cock to the side
of the house facing the stop-cock.
3.12.5 The meter on services installed under Sections 3.12.2, 3.12.3, and 3.12.4 shall be in an
accessible location just inside the front wall of the building.
3.12.6 The meter on a house with a slab foundation shall be installed in an outside setting and the
service may enter the house where convenient.
3.13 FIRE HYDRANTS
3.13.1 Fire hydrants shall be installed at the developer’s expense.
3.13.2 In residential subdivisions, the hydrants shall be spaced at intervals not to exceed 500 feet,
unless greater space between hydrants is approved by the Fire Marshal.
3.13.3 In no event shall the distance between a hydrant and any house location in a subdivision
exceed 500 feet.
3.13.4 In commercial subdivisions, hydrants shall be placed at intervals not to exceed 250 feet,
unless a greater space between hydrants is approved by the Fire Marshal.
3.13.5 In industrial and warehouse subdivisions, hydrants shall be placed in the most appropriate
locations to ensure adequate fire protection for all properties. The hydrant spacing shall be
approved by the Fire Marshal. In no event shall the distance between a hydrant and an
industrial building exceed 250 feet.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
3.14 ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION LINES
All electrical and telecommunication cables or wires shall be buried underground from the nearest
source to and within the subdivision that they are intended to serve, in a location approved by the
Town Engineer. If the Town Engineer and Town Planner jointly agree that connection from the
source to the subdivision is inordinately difficult due to adverse site conditions such as the presence
of significant ledge or inland wetlands, they may waive the requirement for, or part of, that
underground connection.
3.14.1 All primary and secondary lines placed between street lines shall be buried at a minimum
depth of three feet below the approved final grade of streets, walks, or tree belts.
3.14.2 Related equipment cabinets shall be located to minimize hazards to the public, and such
locations shall be approved by the Town Engineer.
3.15 PASSIVE SOLAR DESIGN
Applicants for residential subdivisions shall demonstrate to the Commission that they have
considered the use of passive solar energy techniques (as defined in Section 2) in the design of the
subdivision.
The purpose of these techniques is to encourage energy conservation, primarily by taking advantage
of southern exposures to the maximum extent possible. Through proper lot design and house
orientation, a wider range of choices are made available to the future owner regarding building
design alternatives that can maximize this solar access advantage.
As a minimum, the passive solar energy techniques considered shall include:
Section 3.15
3-13
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
3.15.1 House Orientation. In order to take maximum advantage of the winter sun for heating
purposes, a building’s longest plane should be positioned no more than 30° off the
east/west axis. For the Commission’s consideration and for the information of the future
lot owner, the subdivision plan shall show house orientations that provide the best solar
access.
Section 3.15
3-14
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
SUBDIVISION OF LAND
3.15.2 Street and Lot Layout. Street patterns and lot lines generally determine building orientation.
Where no topographic constraints exist, streets shall have an east/west orientation to the
greatest extent possible, preferably within 30° of the east/west axis. Where this orientation
is not possible or desirable, side lot lines are encouraged to be oriented as close as possible
to a north/south orientation.
3.15.3 Vegetation. Trees can serve as valuable tools in conserving energy in residential buildings.
If existing plant materials serve as wind barriers by being positioned north or northwest of
homes, they should be retained. Street trees should be planted in a type and location based
upon avoiding conflict with a building’s southern exposure.
3.15.4 Natural and Man-Made Topographical Features. Solar access is dependent on the slope of
the land. When open space is part of a subdivision proposal, consideration shall be given to
locating open space on north facing slopes, which are not conducive to good solar access.
Consideration shall also be given to locating lots on south facing slopes, which are
favorable to good solar access.
3.15.5 Protection of Solar Access within the Development. For the information of the future lot
owner, areas shall be shown on each lot where tree removal would be necessary to provide
solar access for the building’s south-facing wall. Lots with major yard areas to the south of
the buildings are encouraged as these are under the owner’s control. Where necessary, the
placement of solar easements on lots is encouraged.

Bonding for subdivisions and other instances where a bond may be required by these
Regulations shall conform to the following procedures.
A Performance Bonds
1. Prior to issuance of a Building Permit within an approved subdivision, the
developer shall have completed all public improvements and/or similar
common elements (e.g., roads, sidewalks, storm drainage facilities), or may
complete those improvements that are minimally necessary to support the
development and protect the public health, safety, and welfare of prospective
residents (e.g., the base course of pavement, storm drainage facilities, fire
hydrants) and post a performance bond for the balance of the improvements.
2. A licensed Professional Engineer shall prepare a bond estimate containing the
type, estimated quantities, and costs of labor and materials needed to complete
the required improvements, including but not limited to:
a. street grading, roadway paving, and street plantings;
b. installation of curbs, gutters, storm drainage facilities, landscaping,,
sidewalks, lighting, monuments, bridges, and culverts;
c. erosion and sedimentation control measures; and
d. all other such improvements that the Commission determines to be
necessary to promote public health and safety and to safeguard the Town
in regard to the future maintenance of the required improvements.
3. The performance bond shall be in the amount equal to the cost of constructing
any remaining improvements but no less than ten percent of the cost of all
improvements, excluding water and sanitary sewer lines, as estimated in
accordance with Subsection (2) above and approved by the Town Engineer.
4. Prior to issuing a Certificate of Occupancy for a new residential building in a
subdivision, the following improvements shall have been provided on the
associated lot in accordance with the approved subdivision plan:
a. all permanent metal boundary marker pins in accordance with Section
3.5.7;
Section 5.2
5-8
PROCEDURES
b. all required trees in accordance with Section 3.10.1; and
c. final grading over all disturbed areas in accordance with the approved
plan, including stabilization of the soil (e.g., seeding and topsoil, wood
chips, landscaping). In cases where problem soils exist, and where there
is disagreement regarding the quality of the soil, the standard shall be a
minimum of five percent organic content, which the Town may test to
verify.
5. In specific cases where the improvements specified in Section 5.2.11A(4)
cannot be installed on individual lots due to unusual weather or site conditions
at the time the Certificate of Occupancy is sought, their installation may be
deferred to a specific time, not to exceed one year, by the Town Engineer, or
the Town Planner in the case of required trees. To be granted this extension,
the developer shall execute a Town prepared written agreement stating that all
unfinished improvements will be made within the specified time. This
agreement shall also state that in the event these improvements are not installed
by the deadline, he waives his right to contest the utilization of the posted cash
bond by the Town to have these improvements made, and that the Town (or a
designee contracted by the Town to make the improvements should the bond
called) has rights of access to the property to make the improvements. In no
event shall the monies used by the Town exceed the amounts specified in the
original subdivision bond.
6. The developer shall install sidewalks before two-thirds of the lots on the side of
a street requiring sidewalks have either been conveyed or issued a Certificate
of Occupancy or no additional Certificates of Occupancy may be issued for lots
on that side of the street unless the Town Engineer finds that the sidewalks
cannot be installed at that time due to unusual weather or site conditions and
defers their installation for up to one year. To defer a required sidewalk, the
developer shall execute a Town prepared written agreement stating that in the
event sidewalks are not installed within the specified time, he waives his right
to contest the utilization of the performance bond by the Town to install the
sidewalks, and that the Town (or an agent contracted by the Town to make
improvements should the bond be called) have the right to enter the property to
install the sidewalks.
B Maintenance Bonds
Upon the completion of all public improvements and/or similar common
improvements associated with a subdivision to the satisfaction of Town staff and
acceptance by the Town Council in the case of public improvements and/or open
space, a maintenance bond equal to five percent of the cost of the all of the public or
common improvements shall be submitted to and approved by the Town Engineer.
Alternatively, up to 95 percent of a performance bond may be released, retaining five
percent in cash as the required maintenance bond. Unless otherwise specified, the
maintenance bond shall be held for a period of one year after acceptance or in the
case of private improvements, from the date that all site improvements have been
completed, so that the Town and/or homeowner’s association are protected against
faulty construction.
Section 5.2
5-9
PROCEDURES
C Bonding Procedure
1. A Subdivision Bond Application shall be submitted to the Planning
Department along with the appropriate application fee and performance or

the bond estimate prepared in accordance with Section 5.2.11A(2) is sufficient
to cover the costs of constructing remaining improvements.
3. The Planning Department shall transmit the bond to the Finance Department,
who will issue a receipt to the applicant.
4. Release of Bonds
a. At the written request of the applicant upon completion of required
improvements totaling 50 percent or more of the cost of the bonded
improvements, the Town may release at least 50 percent, but not more
than 95 percent, of a performance bond upon submittal of documentation
and verification by Town staff that an equivalent portion of the required
improvements have been completed in accordance with approved plans.
b. At the written request of the applicant, the Town may release any
remaining balance of a performance bond, but not more than 95 percent,
provided that all required improvements and conditions of the
Commission's approval have been satisfactorily completed.
c. The last 25 percent of any performance bond remaining with the Town
shall be in the form of cash (certified check).
d. Once public improvements are constructed, the Town shall require a
maintenance bond in the amount of five percent of the original bonded
amount to be held for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of
the improvements by the Town, to ensure that none of the required
improvements have failed, or in the event of their failure, have been
repaired to the Town Engineer’s satisfaction. The maintenance bond
may be provided by a new maintenance bond application or the applicant
may request that the Town hold the remaining 5 percent of the
performance bond as a maintenance bond.
e. After one year from the acceptance of a maintenance bond, if none of the
required improvements have failed, or in the event of their failure, have

D The Commission shall process the application within the time periods specified in
Section 5.2.9.
E In addition to any other modifications that the Commission may attach to an

Application subject to Town Staff review and approval to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare and ensure compliance with these Regulations.
Approvals with modifications subject to Town Staff review and approval shall be
limited to technical and minor changes that have a reasonable assurance of being
approved by Town Staff. The Commission shall state the nature of each change in
the motion to modify and approve.
F If an approval involves a waiver of these Regulations, the waiver must be approved
by a vote of at least three-fourths of the Commissioners seated at the time of the
decision. The Commission shall state upon its records the reasons for each waiver
granted.
5.3.3 Following Approval
A In addition to any requirements outlined below, the Commission shall document its
action in accordance with Section 5.2.10.
B Following approval, the applicant shall deliver three complete paper sets of
subdivision plans (including engineering plans and profiles) to the Planning
Department for distribution to Town Staff for final review:
1. bearing the raised seal of the appropriate professionals who prepared the
drawing(s);

5-13
PROCEDURES
2. bearing a copy of the Floodplain Development Permit and/ or the Inland
Wetlands and Watercourses Permit, if applicable; and
3. bearing a copy of the decision letter of the Commission.
C When all of the plans are found to be in conformance with the approval and any
modifications that may have been made by the Commission, the Planning
Department will request the applicant to provide one mylar set of subdivision plans
for filing with the Town Clerk (recording mylars) and one complete mylar set of
subdivision plans (including engineering plans and profiles), both for endorsement by
the Chair or Secretary of the Commission.
D The endorsed recording mylars shall be released to the applicant for filing with the
Town Clerk not more than thirty days after the time for taking an appeal from the
action of the Commission has elapsed or not more than thirty days after the date that
plans modified in accordance with the Commission's approval and that comply with
CGS Section 7-31 are delivered to the Commission, whichever is later. In the event
of an appeal, the recording mylars shall be released to the applicant for filing not
more than thirty days after the termination of such appeal by dismissal, withdrawal,
or judgment in favor of the applicant or not more than thirty days after the date that
plans modified in accordance with the Commission's approval and that comply with
CGS Section 7-31 are delivered to the Commission, whichever is later.
E No subdivision plans shall be recorded by the Town Clerk until the recording mylars
have been endorsed by the Chair or Secretary of the Commission, and the recording
of a subdivision plan without such approval shall be void.
5.3.4 Expiration and Completion
A All public improvements or similar common elements within an approved
subdivision shall be completed within five years of approval of the plans. Failure to
complete all work within such five-year period or any extension thereof shall result in
automatic expiration of the approval of the subdivision provided that the Commission
records a notice of expiration in the Town Clerk’s Office. No additional lots in the
subdivision shall be conveyed without approval by the Commission of a new
application for subdivision.
B The Commission may grant one or more extensions of the time to complete all or part
of the work in connection with the subdivision, provided the total extension(s) does
not exceed ten years from the original date of approval.
C The Commission may condition an extension on a determination of the adequacy of
the performance bond.
5.4 SUBDIVISION REVISION APPLICATION PROCEDURES
Technical and minor modifications to an approved subdivision or re-subdivision plan may be
jointly approved by the Town Planner, Town Engineer, Building Official, Fire Marshal, and other
relevant Town Staff when proposed changes are limited to: development phasing; erosion and
sedimentation controls; grading; landscaping; lot area or frontage; sidewalks, stormwater drainage;
street lighting; utilities and varied front yards. When Inland Wetlands and Watercourses

day of application for subdivision revision and the revision shall not be approved unless in
accordance with the approval of the IWWC. Plans indicating technical and minor modifications
shall be filed in the Commission files and the Town Planner shall report all approvals to the
Commission at its next meeting. If there is disagreement on any issue between the staff and the
applicant, the application will be referred to the Commission for subdivision revision approval. If
