PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Portland, Connecticut. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1991 Code, as supplemented through June 11, 2003, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of selectmen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Portland Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Shelly Hayes, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Bernadette Dillon, Town Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

If any contract has been entered into by the town prior to the effective date of this Charter, or any bond or undertaking has been given by or in favor of the town, which contains provisions that the same may be enforced by any board or department therein named which is hereby abolished or superseded by the creation herein of a new board or department to which are granted similar powers and jurisdiction, such contracts, bonds or undertakings shall continue in full force and effect. The powers conferred and the duties imposed with reference to the same upon any such board or department shall, except as otherwise provided in this Charter, hereafter be exercised and discharged by the chief executive officer of the town. 
Section 103. - General grant of powers. 
    In addition to all powers granted to the town under the constitution and general statutes, particularly section 7-148 and section 7-149 of the general statutes, the town shall have all of the powers granted by or implied in this Charter, and all other powers necessary to the management, government, and affairs of the town. The town shall have the power to enter into contracts for any purposes not prohibited by law. The enumeration of specific powers in this and any other chapter of this Charter shall not be construed as limiting this general grant of powers, but shall be considered as an addition thereto. 
Section 104. - Effect of Charter. 
    This Charter shall be the organic law of the town in the administration of local affairs. Special acts, ordinances, bylaws and resolutions inconsistent with this Charter and superseded by it shall have no further force or effect after the effective date of this Charter.

The board of education shall be empowered to fill its vacancies. Any such vacancy shall be filled by the appointment of a member of the same political party as the person vacating the office in the event the person was affiliated with a political party, or by the appointment of an unaffiliated elector if the office shall be vacated by an unaffiliated elector. Endorsement alone by a political party in this instance shall not constitute an affiliation either for the vacating member or the replacement member.

(Ord. of 10-1-1951) 
DIVISION 1.5. - ETHICS CODE 
Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 2-33.1. - Declaration of policy. 
(a)  A successful representative democracy requires that citizens be secure in the trust they place in their representatives. That trust is based on the citizens' belief that their representatives share community values, such as honesty, integrity, fairness, moral responsibility, sense of right and wrong, and that these values will guide the representatives in the conduct of community business. 
(1)  All those who serve the town in any way accept a public trust which they share with all other representatives of the town. Citizens' belief in town representatives' trustworthiness comes about when citizens observe town representatives fulfilling their duties faithfully and honestly, subordinating their personal interests to the public good in any circumstances or possible circumstances in which the two conflict. 
(2)  Citizens need to see the town's business being conducted openly, providing citizens with access to the information on which town decisions and actions are based. At the same time, citizens should be assured that the privacy rights of all persons are protected and confidentiality regarding their affairs is assured. 
(3)  Citizen confidence in town government and in the conduct of all town representatives is further supported when public interest is defined and when violations of public interest are prohibited, when ethical behavior is supported and when unethical behavior is disciplined. Citizens must see established a process for addressing ethical questions that is open, fair and effective. 
(4)  This division provides these assurances with clear, written statements for making community judgments in which the interests of the public are foremost in all decisions made and actions undertaken. This division also ensures town representatives that they will be supported by the community when they behave ethically and will be protected if they notify the appropriate individual or group of unethical behavior. 
(b)  Town representatives have a responsibility to act with integrity, avoiding any behavior, lawful or unlawful, which could call the integrity of town government into question. Town representatives have a duty to abide by the general laws of the state and town. Repeated violations of state and town laws may indicate disrespect for the law and may contribute to the erosion of public trust. 
(c)  The town recognizes that: 
(1)  Town representatives are also members of the community, sharing similar personal and economic interests as all members of the community; 
(2)  Town representatives retain their rights to express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal and economic interests or rights; 
(3)  Standards of ethical conduct that distinguish between minor and inconsequential conflicts, unavoidable in a free society, and those that are personal, material and avoidable, are sound public policy; and 
(4)  Town representatives are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain investments, none of which impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the town. 
(d)  This division is necessary to identify minimum standards below which a town representative's conduct may not fall without risk of penalty. However, it is understood that a healthy ethical environment for the provision of public service cannot be achieved or maintained by mere adherence to minimum standards. The principal policy which forms the foundation of this division is to encourage internal commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports integrity with pride and enthusiasm. A work environment which supports integrity includes town representatives who: 
(1)  Recognize that the primary reason they hold a public position is to serve the public; 
(2)  Recognize that the public's trust in government and in them is diminished when any public representative acts unethically; 
(3)  Recognize that their public service is an opportunity to help maintain public trust in their government; 
(4)  Are fair and impartial, as well as courteous and enthusiastic in serving the public and each other in the performance of their duties; 
(5)  Are adequately educated in the principles of ethics and exemplify the ethical conduct which protects, advances, and promotes the public interest; 
(6)  Are motivated to pursue ethical ideals which exceed minimum standards and often achieve the highest standards; 
(7)  Express approval of positive ethical principles and behavior, and refrain from disparaging or demeaning those who advocate ethical principles or practice ethical behavior; 
(8)  When they observe serious unethical practices, discourage the unethical behavior and promptly disclose it to the appropriate authorities and encourage others to do the same; and 
(9)  Ensure that those for whose performance they are responsible are aware of the minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of disciplinary consequences; and when circumstances warrant, recommend appropriate discipline of those who are proven to have engaged in unethical behavior. 
(Ord. of 1-16-2008, § 1-1) 
Sec. 2-33.2. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division shall be: 
(1)  To state principles of ethics which are to be applied to public service; 
(2)  To identify minimum standards of ethical conduct for town representatives; 
(3)  To require that town representatives engage in ethical practices which meet or exceed minimum standards; 
(4)  To encourage town representatives to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve; 
(5)  To provide a process by which town representatives may identify and resolve ethical issues; 
(6)  To inform town representatives and the public of the minimum standards to which town representatives must adhere; 
(7)  To promote public confidence in the integrity of town representatives; 
(8)  To encourage members of the public to seek public office or employment to serve on public boards, to assist town representatives, and to take pride in participating in the governmental process; 
(9)  To establish a process for the commission to determine if a town representative has violated this division; and 
(10)  To provide for a just and reasonable balance among the rights of all individuals who are directly affected by the operation of this division.

(17)  Anything of value received as a devise, bequest or inheritance.

It is to be stressed that the term "personal interest of a town representative" includes not only the personal interest of the individual town representative, but also the personal interest of any partner-in-interest. 
    Town representative means any member of the board of selectmen or of any town agency, board, commission, committee, or other voting body, and any agent, department head, employee, official, supervisor, or other person, whether elected or appointed, or otherwise authorized by contract to make decisions or exercise discretionary power on behalf of the town.

Sec. 5-4. - Regulation of vicious dogs. 
(a)  Purpose. It is hereby declared that vicious dogs have become a serious threat to the safety and welfare of the citizens of our community. Unprovoked attacks by vicious dogs upon persons and animals throughout the country have occurred at an increasing rate and the existing laws are inadequate to deal with the threat to the public. The owning, keeping or harboring of vicious dogs is a nuisance and many of the attacks have been attributed to the failure of owners to register, confine and properly control their vicious dogs. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following words and terms shall have the following meanings unless the context shall indicate another or different meaning or intent: 
    Domestic animals: Includes, but is not limited to, all forms of livestock. 
    Enclosure: A fence or structure not more than six feet in height and at least five by ten feet, forming or causing an enclosure suitable to prevent the entry of young children and suitable to confine a vicious dog in conjunction with other measures which may be taken by the owner or keeper, such as tethering of the vicious dog. Such "enclosure" shall be securely enclosed, locked, designed with secure sides, top and bottom, designed to prevent the dog from escaping the enclosure and also provide the dog protection from the elements. 
    Impounded: Taken into custody of the municipal dog pound. 
    Owner: Any natural person or legal entity including, but not limited to, a firm, corporation, organization, partnership or trust, possessing, harboring, having, keeping an interest in or having control or custody of the dog. 
    Panel: A panel of three individuals, which shall include the first selectman, one veterinarian licensed in the state and the health officer. 
    Vicious dog: A dog is not "vicious" by virtue of any past behavior or propensity until the panel makes the determination based upon evidence presented to it that a dog: 
(1)  Which bites, inflicts injury, assaults or otherwise attacks a human being or domestic animal without provocation on public or private property; is owned or harbored primarily, or in part, for the purpose of dog fighting or any dog trained for dog fighting; 
(2)  Notwithstanding the definition of a "vicious dog" above, no dog may be declared vicious if an injury or damage is sustained by a person who, at the time such injury or damage was sustained, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon premises occupied by the owner of the dog or was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. 
(3)  No dog may be declared vicious if an injury or damage was sustained by a domestic animal, which at the time that such injury or damage was sustained, was teasing, tormenting or assaulting the dog. No dog may be declared vicious if the dog was protecting or defending a human being within the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault. 
(c)  Control of vicious dogs. All vicious dogs shall be confined in an enclosure. It shall be unlawful for any owner to maintain a vicious dog upon any premises which does not have a locked enclosure. It shall be unlawful for an owner of a vicious dog to permit the dog to be outside the enclosure unless the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a chain type leash and under the direct control and supervision of the said owner. The chain shall have a minimum tensile strength of 300 pounds and not exceed three feet in length. The muzzle shall be made in such a manner that will not cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration but shall prevent it from biting any person or animal. The owner shall display a sign on the premises warning others of a vicious dog on the premises. Said sign shall be visible and capable of being read from the street, road or highway, whether public or private, which abuts said premises. 
(d)  Prohibited activities. No person shall own or harbor any dog for the purpose of dog fighting or train, torment, badger, bait or use any dog for the purpose of causing or encouraging said dog to unprovoked attacks upon human beings or domestic animals. 
(e)  Impoundment; issuance of citations; hearing procedures; appeals. 
(1)  In the event the animal control officer has probable cause to believe that a dog is vicious, upon notification the first selectman, or his designee, shall be empowered to convene a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the dog in question should be declared vicious. The first selectman, or his designee, shall notify the owner of the dog that a hearing will be held, at which time such owner shall have the opportunity to present evidence why the dog should not be declared vicious. The hearing shall be conducted by the panel. Said hearing shall be held promptly within no less than five days but no more than ten days after service of notice upon the owner of the dog. The hearing shall be open to the public. 
(2)  After the hearing, the owner of the dog shall be notified in writing of the decision. If a decision is made that the dog is vicious, the owner shall comply with the provisions of this section in accordance with a time schedule established by the animal control officer or his designee, but in no case more than 30 days subsequent to the date of the determination. If the owner of the dog contests the determination, he may request a hearing before the state commission of agriculture when such is provided by G.S. § 22-358. 
(3)  In the event the animal control officer has probable cause to believe the dog in question is vicious and may pose a threat of serious harm to human beings or domestic animals, the animal control officer shall seize and impound the dog pending the hearing. The owner of the dog shall be liable to the town for the costs and expenses, including shelter, food and veterinary expenses, necessitated by the seizure of such dog. 
(f)  Violations and penalties. 
(1)  Any vicious dog which is not maintained within an enclosure on the premises or outside of the dwelling of the owner or outside of an enclosure and unmuzzled and/or unchained, as provided herein, shall be confiscated by the animal control officer and impounded for a period of 14 days. Following the second impoundment under this section, the dog may be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner, but only after written notice to the owner of a hearing and order of the animal control officer. The owner may request a hearing before the state commission of agriculture, when such is provided for by G.S. § 22-358, or when not so provided, then by the panel within 14 days of said order. In the event that the owner requests said hearing, the destruction of the dog shall be stayed until such time as the commissioner of agriculture affirms the order of the animal control officer. In addition, the owner shall pay a fine of $99.00 and such costs and expenses necessitated by each seizure of the dog, including such expenses as may be required for the destruction of such dog. 
(2)  If any vicious dog should attack, assault, wound, bite or otherwise injure or kill a human being or domestic animal, when unprovoked, the owner of said dog shall pay a fine of $99.00 and the animal control officer is empowered to confiscate and impound said dog for a period of 14 days. Following impoundment under this section, the dog may be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner but only after the owner has been advised by written notice of a hearing and order of the animal control officer. The owner may request a hearing before the commissioner of agriculture, when such is provided for by G.S. § 22-358, or when not so provided, then by the panel within 14 days of the issuance of said order. In the event the owner requests said hearing, the destruction of the dog shall be stayed until such time as the commissioner affirms the order of the animal control officer. In addition, the owner shall pay such costs and expenses necessitated by the seizure of the dog, including such expenses as may be required for the destruction of such dog. The penalties set forth herein shall not limit the right of any victim to bring a civil action against the owner or keeper of a vicious dog, as provided for by state law. 
(g)  Responsibility of parents for ensuring compliance. In the event the owner of the vicious dog is a minor, the parent or guardian shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with this section.

Secs. 12-5-12-30. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - ADULT-ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 12-31. - Findings and purpose. 
    The board of selectmen finds: 
(1)  There are or may in the future be adult-oriented establishments located in the town which require special supervision from the town's public safety agencies in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishments as well as the health, safety and welfare of the town's citizens. 
(2)  Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States indicate that: 
a.  Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such adult-oriented establishments, especially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studies and rooms for the private viewing of so-called adult motion pictures and/or videotapes and/or live entertainment. 
b.  Persons under the age of 18 may be attracted to adult-oriented establishments and seek to enter or loiter about them without the knowledge or permission of their parents or guardians. 
c.  Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons, clients or customers of such adult-oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in certain sexual acts. 
d.  Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms. 
e.  Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while said areas are in use encourage patrons using said areas to engage in sexual acts therein with prostitutes or others, thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the commission of sexual acts which cause blood, semen and urine to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of said areas, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such deposits. 
f.  The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented establishments tends to discourage such sexual acts and prostitution and thereby promotes the health, safety and welfare of the patrons, clients and customers of such establishments. 
g.  The nature of adult-oriented establishments and the traffic which they generate and the potential and the propensity for such establishments to attract persons interested in explicit sexual activities or erotic art forms and the potential for outdoor assembly of such persons around the premises of such establishments are such as to make them incompatible with nearby uses of land where concentrations of children or youth tend to congregate. 
(3)  The continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments, including without limitations those specifically cited in subsection (1) hereof, is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the town. 
(4)  The constitution and laws of the state grant to the town powers, especially police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise adult-oriented establishments as hereinafter defined in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(5)  It is not the intent of the board of selectmen, in enacting this article, to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States and/or state Constitutions nor is it the intent of the board of selectmen to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents or any communicative materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and/or other materials. Further, by enacting this article, the board of selectmen does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain and/or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States and/or state Constitutions nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such materials.

After the removal of the temporary patch and prior to the placement of the permanent bituminous material, the existing pavement will be cut back as directed by the director of public works or his authorized representative to create vertical faces which will either be parallel or perpendicular to the new pavement. The vertical faces will be sealed with 85/100 asphaltic material to ensure a good bond between the old and new pavement material. The surface of the repaved excavation shall be flush with the adjacent pavement. Curbs and sidewalks are considered a part of the pavement and are to be restored to their original condition in accordance with applicable town standards and specifications. 
(c)  All grassed or open areas are to be rough graded with boulders larger than six inches removed from the site. All lawned areas are to be fine graded with four inches of topsoil and seeded as approved by the director of public works.

Secs. 18-11-18-14. - Reserved. 
Sec. 18-15. - Supplementary tax relief. 
(a)  Eligibility for benefits; age, disability and income requirements. 
(1)  Subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth, real property tax deferral benefits shall be available with respect to real property located in the town owned and occupied as their principal residence by residents of the town who are: 
a.  65 years of age and over or whose spouse, living with them, are 65 years of age or over; or 60 years of age or over and the surviving spouse of a taxpayer qualified under this plan at the time of spouse's death; or with respect to real property located in the town occupied as their principal residence on which such residents or spouses are liable for taxes under section 12-48 of the state General Statutes; or 
b.  Under age 65 and eligible in accordance with applicable federal regulations to receive permanent total disability benefits under social security or who have not been engaged in employment covered by social security and accordingly have not qualified for benefits thereunder but have become qualified for permanent total disability benefits under any federal, state or local government retirement or disability plan, including the Railroad Retirement Act and any government-related teachers' retirement plan in which requirements with respect to qualifications for such permanent total disability benefits are comparable to such requirements under social security. 
(2)  All such residents or their spouses shall have been taxpayers of the town for one year immediately preceding their receipt of tax benefits under this plan and their total adjusted gross income for purposes of the federal income tax, plus any other income not included in such adjusted gross income (the total of which shall be called "qualifying income"), shall not exceed $2,000.00 over the state limits of the homeowners' tax relief program. Evidence of such income shall be required and a signed affidavit shall be submitted to the town assessor when application for benefits under this plan is filed. The amount of any Medicaid payments made on behalf of such homeowner or the spouse of such homeowner shall not constitute income. 
(3)  Such person has resided at and paid real estate taxes on a residence located in the town for a period of five consecutive years prior to his application for tax relief and does not owe delinquent taxes to the town. 
(b)  Participation in state programs required. All such residents or spouses who may qualify for tax relief under G.S. §§ 12-129b through 12-129d, inclusive, 12-129n and/or 12-170aa must apply for and be included, if qualified, in such program or programs as a condition precedent to qualifying for and receiving benefits under supplementary tax relief plan (STRP). 
(c)  Limitations on benefits. 
(1)  For those such residents or spouses receiving or eligible to receive benefits under the state tax relief program referred to in subsection (b) above, the benefit available under STRP shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 75 percent of the total amount of the tax which would be laid against the taxpayer for said real property, except for said G.S. §§ 12-129b through 12-129d, inclusive, 12-129n and/or 12-170aa and STRP. Thus, the tax deferment available to such residents or their spouses under STRP shall be equal to the difference between the abatement afforded by such state programs and 75 percent of the taxes laid against the taxpayer for such real property. If benefits received under state programs exceed 75 percent of the total taxes due, no tax deferment benefit shall be available under STRP. 
(2)  For those residents or their spouses who otherwise meet the requirements for such state program or programs but whose incomes are in excess of the state limits, the following schedule of tax deferments will apply if the applicant meets the income requirements specified in subsection (a)(2) above for that year: 
a.  For unmarried homeowners, a tax deferment of 50 percent of the total tax levied against the taxpayer shall be applied. 
b.  For married homeowners, a tax deferment of 60 percent of the total tax levied against the taxpayer shall be applied. 
(3)  There shall be no tax deferment benefits available under STRP where income exceeds said limits specified in subsection (a)(2) above. 
(d)  Fractional interests or multiple-family dwellings. The real property tax deferral relief provided under STRP may, in any case where title to the real property is recorded in the name of the taxpayer or his spouse and any other person or persons, be prorated to reflect the fractional share of such taxpayer or spouse, or, if such real property is a multiple-family dwelling, such relief may be prorated to reflect the fractional portion of such property occupied by the taxpayer. 
(e)  Unit owners of cooperatives. Pursuant to G.S. § 12-129n, subsection (g), the tax relief provided under STRP shall be available to persons who qualify in accordance with the requirements of this section and who are unit owners of a cooperative. The amount of relief shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of G.S. § 12-129n, subsection (g)(2). 
(f)  Interest, lien and repayment. 
(1)  All tax deferments granted under STRP shall bear interest from the date said deferred taxes become due (July 1 and January 1 of each year) until fully paid. The rate of interest payable on such deferred taxes shall be set annually and based on the prime interest rate set by the Federal Reserve Board on June 30 of each fiscal year. 
(2)  As a condition precedent to receiving the tax deferral benefits, an applicant shall execute a tax deferral lien on a form provided by the assessor, in favor of the town at the time application for benefits hereunder is made, to be recorded on the town land records by the town tax collector upon the approval of such application by the town assessor. 
(3)  Upon approval the applicant shall cause his insurer to name the town as an additional insured on any insurance policy covering the subject property. 
(4)  Taxes deferred under STRP shall be due and payable, together with accumulated interest thereon, at such time as the real property in question is sold and conveyed, whether or not for value, or title is transferred or upon the death of such taxpayer (unless a spouse qualified under subsection (a) hereof survives), whichever event first occurs. 
(g)  Annual application required. 
(1)  Any resident believing themselves entitled to tax deferments under STRP for any assessment year, shall complete an application form and submit the form for approval to the town assessor at any time from February 1 to and including May 15 of the year for which the tax deferment benefit is claimed. In completing such application, the applicant shall present to the assessor, in substantiation of his application, a copy of applicant's federal income tax return, including a copy of social security statement of earnings for such applicant and that of applicant's spouse, if filed separately, for such applicant's taxable year ending immediately prior to the submission of such application or, if not required to file a return, such other evidence of qualifying income in respect to such taxable year as may be required by the assessor. 
(2)  When the assessor is satisfied that the applicant is qualified for the tax deferment in accordance with STRP, the assessor shall issue a certificate of tax deferment showing the amount of the taxes deferred to the applicant and deliver a copy of said certificate of deferment, together with the executed tax deferral lien, to the town tax collector. 
(3)  The amount of the tax deferment approved shall be applied to the real property tax payable by the resident taxpayer for the assessment year in which such application is submitted and approved. If any such resident taxpayer has qualified for a tax deferment under STRP, the deferment shall be applied or prorated uniformly over the number of installments in which the real property tax is due. 
(4)  The total of all deferment granted under the provisions of this ordinance for any tax year shall not exceed an amount equal to one-quarter percent of the town's current adopted operating budget in effect as of February 1. In the event it exceeds one-quarter percent of the budget, the tax deferment given to eligible persons shall be prorated uniformly to keep the total amount of town tax deferments within the statutory limit using the following formula: 
FORMULA:

(a)  Qualification and requirements. 
(1)  An owner of real property or any tenant for life or for a term of years liable for property taxes under G.S. § 12-48 who meets the qualifications stated in this subsection shall be entitled to pay the tax levied on such property, calculated in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this section for the first year the claim for such tax relief is filed and approved in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, and such person shall be entitled to continue to pay the amount of such tax or such lesser amount as may be levied in any year, during such subsequent year that such person meets such qualifications, and the surviving spouse of such owner or tenant, qualified in accordance with the requirement pertaining to a surviving spouse in this subsection, or any owner or tenant possessing a joint interest in such property with such owner at the time of such owner's death and qualified at such time in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, shall be entitled to continue to pay the amount of such tax or such lesser amount as may be levied in any year, as it becomes due each year following the death of such owner for as long as such surviving spouse or joint owner or joint tenant is qualified in accordance with the requirements in this subsection. After the first year a claim for such tax relief is filed and approved, application for such tax relief shall be filed biennially on a form prepared for such purpose by the town assessor. Any such owner or tenant who is qualified in accordance with this section and any such surviving spouse or joint owner or joint tenant surviving upon the death of such owner or tenant shall be entitled to pay such tax in the amount as provided in this section for so long as such owner or tenant or such surviving spouse or joint owner or joint tenant continues to be so qualified. To qualify for the tax relief provided in this section, a taxpayer shall meet all of the following requirements: 
a.  On December 31 of the calendar year preceding the year in which the claim is filed, be: 
1.  70 years of age or over; 
2.  The spouse of a person, 70 years of age or over, provided such spouse is domiciled with such person; or 
3.  62 years of age or over and the surviving spouse of a taxpayer who at the time of such taxpayer's death had qualified and was entitled to receive tax relief under this section, provided such surviving spouse was domiciled with such taxpayer at the time of the taxpayer's death; 
b.  Occupy such real property as his home; 
c.  Either spouse shall have resided within the state for at least one year before filing the claim under this section; 
d.  The taxable and nontaxable income of such taxpayer, the total of which shall hereinafter be called qualifying income, in the tax year of such homeowner ending immediately preceding the date of application for benefits under the program in this section, was not in excess of limits set forth in G.S. § 12-170aa, adjusted annually, evidence of which income shall be submitted to the town assessor in such form and manner as the assessor may prescribe. The amount of any Medicaid payments made on behalf of the homeowner or the spouse of such homeowner shall not constitute income. The income of the spouse of such homeowner shall not be included in the qualifying income of such homeowner for purposes of determining eligibility for tax relief under this section, if such spouse is a resident of a health care or nursing home facility in this state, and such facility receives payment related to such spouse under title XIX Medicaid program; 
e.  The assets of the taxpayer excluding the real property for which the taxpayer is seeking tax relief shall not exceed a value of $150,000.00. 
(2)  The tax on the real property for which the benefits of this section are claimed shall be the lower of: the tax due with respect to the homeowner's residence for the assessment year commencing October 1 of the year immediately preceding the year in which the initial claim for relief is made, or the tax due for any subsequent assessment year. If title to real property is recorded in the name of the person or the spouse making a claim and qualifying under this section and any other person, the claimant hereunder shall be entitled to pay the claimant's fractional share of the tax on such property calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section, and such other person shall pay the person's or persons' fractional share of the tax without regard for the provisions of this section. For the purposes of this section, the term "mobile manufactured home," as defined in G.S. § 12-63a shall be deemed to be real property. 
(3)  If any person with respect to whom a claim for tax relief in accordance with this section has been approved for any assessment year transfers, assigns, grants or otherwise conveys subsequent to October 1, but prior to August 1 in such assessment year, the interest in real property to which such claim for tax relief is related, regardless of whether such transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance is voluntary or involuntary, the amount of such tax relief benefit, determined as the amount by which the tax payable without benefit of this section exceeds the tax payable under the provisions of this section, shall be a pro rata portion of the amount otherwise applicable in such assessment year to be determined by a fraction of the numerator of which shall be the number of full months from October 1 in such assessment year to the date of such conveyance and the denominator of which shall be 12. If such conveyance occurs in the month of October, the grantor shall be disqualified for such tax relief in such assessment year. The grantee shall be required within a period not exceeding ten days immediately following the date of such conveyance to notify the assessor thereof, or in the absence of such notice, upon determination by the assessor that such transfer, assignment, grant or conveyance has occurred, the assessor shall determine the amount of tax relief benefit to which the grantor is entitled for such assessment year with respect to the interest in real property conveyed and notify the town collector of revenue of the reduced amount of such benefit. Upon receipt of such notice from the assessor, the collector of revenue shall, if such notice is received after the tax due date, no later than ten days thereafter mail or hand a bill to the grantee stating the additional amount of tax due as determined by the assessor. Such tax shall be due and payable and collectible as other property taxes and subject to the same liens and processes of collection, provided such tax shall be due and payable in an initial or single installment not sooner than 30 days after the date such bill is mailed or handed to the grantee and in equal amounts in any remaining, regular installments as the same are due and payable.

A taxpayer may make application to the assessor prior to August 15 of the claim year for an extension of the application period. The assessor may grant such extension in the case of extenuating circumstances due to illness or incapacitation as evidenced by a physician's certificate to that extent, or if the assessor determines there is good cause for doing so. The taxpayer shall present to the assessor a copy of such taxpayer's federal income tax return and federal income tax return of such taxpayer's spouse, if filed separately, for such taxpayer's taxable year ending immediately prior to the submission of the taxpayer's application, or if not required to file a federal income tax return, such other evidence of qualifying income in respect to such taxable year as the assessor may require. Each such application, together with the federal income tax return and any other information submitted in relation thereto, shall be examined by the assessor and a determination shall be made as to whether the application is approved. Upon determination by the assessor that the applying homeowner is entitled to tax relief in accordance with the provisions of this section, the assessor shall notify the homeowner and the town collector of revenue of the approval of such application. The collector of revenue shall determine the maximum amount of tax due with respect to such homeowner's residence and thereafter the property tax with respect to such homeowner's residence shall not exceed such amount. After a taxpayer's claim for the first year has been filed and approved, such taxpayer shall file such an application biennially. In respect to such application required after the filing and approval for the first year the assessor shall notify each such taxpayer concerning application requirements by regular mail not later than February 1 of the assessment year in which such taxpayer is required to reapply, enclosing a copy of the required application form. Such taxpayer may submit such application to the assessor by mail provided it is received by the assessor not later than March 15 in the assessment year with respect to which such tax relief is claimed. Not later than April 1 of such year the assessor shall notify, by certified mail, any such taxpayer for whom such application was not received by said March 15 concerning application requirements and such taxpayer shall submit not later than May 15 such application personally, or, for reasonable cause, by a person acting on behalf of such taxpayer as approved by the assessor. 
(2)  Any person knowingly making a false application for the purpose of claiming property tax relief under this section shall be fined not more than $500.00. Any person who fails to disclose all matters relating thereto or with intent to defraud makes a false statement shall refund to the town all tax relief improperly taken. 
(3)  The town shall establish a lien on such property in the amount of the total tax relief granted, plus interest at a rate of three percent per year, applicable to the total unpaid taxes represented by such tax relief. Any such lien shall have a priority in the settlement of such person's estate. 
(4)  Upon approval of property tax relief granted to any such resident in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the approved applicant shall cause the town to be named an additional insured on any homeowner's insurance policy insuring the subject property. 
(5)  Any such property tax relief granted to any such resident in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not disqualify such resident with respect to any benefits for which such resident shall be eligible under the provisions of G.S. §§ 12-129b through 12-129d, inclusive, and G.S. §§ 12-129n and 12-170aa and any such property tax relief provided under this section shall be in addition to any such benefits for which such resident shall be eligible under G.S. §§ 12-129b through 12-129d, inclusive, and G.S. §§ 12-129n and 12-170aa.

(e)  Severability. The provisions of this section are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this section or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of this section. 
(f)  Ultimate responsibility. The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this section are minimum standards; therefore this section does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. 
(g)  Discharge prohibitions. 
(1)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the storm drainage system any materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drainage system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
a.  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this chapter: Water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
b.  Discharges specified by the first selectman as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
c.  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a written notification to the first selectman prior to the time of the test. Said written notification may be in the form of electronic mail, facsimile transmission or hard copy letter format. 
d.  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
(2)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
a.  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
b.  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
c.  A person is considered to be in violation of this section if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the storm drainage system, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(h)  Suspension of storm drainage system access. 
(1)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The first selectman may, without prior notice, suspend storm drainage system discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the storm drainage system or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the first selectman may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the storm drainage system or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(2)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of this section may have their storm drainage system access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The first selectman will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its storm drainage system access. The violator may petition the first selectman for reconsideration and hearing. 
(3)  [Reinstatement approval required.] A person commits an offense if the person reinstates storm drainage system access to premises terminated pursuant to this subsection, without the prior approval of the first selectman. 
(i)  Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the first selectman prior to the allowing of discharges to the storm drainage system. 
(j)  Right of entry, evaluation, and monitoring of damages. 
(1)  Applicability. This subsection applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial or construction activity, and any other commercial or residential facilities that discharge stormwater to the storm drainage system. 
(2)  Access to facilities. 
a.  The first selectman shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this section as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this section. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives or designees of the first selectman. 
b.  Facility operators shall allow the first selectman ready access to all parts of the facility for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination, and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of a town, state or federal NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
c.  The first selectman shall have the right to set up on any NPDES permitted facilities such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the first selectman to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
d.  The first selectman has the right to require the installation of sampling and monitoring equipment on any NPDES permitted facility by the discharger at its own expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
e.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the first selectman and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
f.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the first selectman access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this section. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the first selectman reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this section. 
g.  If the first selectman has been refused access to any part of the facility from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this section or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the first selectman may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
h.  While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in subsections (2)a. through e. of this section, the first selectman shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the facility. 
(k)  Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. The first selectman will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the storm drainage system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or facility, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the storm drainage system as directed by the first selectman. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial or construction activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(l)  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and attempt to maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(m)  Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or water of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the first selectman in person or by phone, electronic mail or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the first selectman within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
(n)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Notice of violation. Whenever the first selectman finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section, he/she shall order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation: 
a.  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
b.  The elimination of illicit discharges or connections; 
c.  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
d.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and 
e.  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property are required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the first selectman may order the work be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the violator fined an amount equal to the expense thereof, in addition to any fines imposed in subsections (1)b. or (1)c. of this subsection. 
(2)  Procedure for issuance of citations. 
a.  The first selectman shall issue a written notice to any person who violates any provision of this section. No written notice may be issued against the state or any state official or state employee acting within the scope of his employment. Such written notice shall explain the nature of the violation and the steps required for compliance, and shall allow a 72-hour period within which to correct the violation or within which a written plan for correction shall be submitted to the first selectman, setting forth a reasonable time period for correction of the violation as agreed upon by the first selectman. A written notice issued pursuant to this subsection shall be served by hand delivery, at which time the 72-hour period shall begin; or by certified mail return receipt requested and by regular first class mail. Three business days shall be allowed for mail delivery of the notice prior to the commencement of the 72-hour period. 
b.  Within two business days after the period for correction established in subsection (n)(1) expires, the first selectman shall reinspect the subject property to determine compliance. 
c.  If the violations set forth in the written notice have not been corrected at the time of reinspection, the first selectman, in his/her capacity as chief executive officer, may issue a citation and fine of up to $100.00 for each violation by hand, by certified return receipt requested, by leaving a true and attested copy of the citation at the usual place of abode or residence of the person in violation, or in the case of a corporate or business entity, delivery to the business address or the address of the statutory agent of said entity. No such fine shall be levied against the state or any state official or state employee acting within the scope of his employment. All citations issued pursuant to this section shall state the violation for which the citation is being issued, the fine imposed for the violation, the time period within which the fine must be paid, and an address for remittance of the fine. 
(3)  Compliance periods after citation. 
a.  Any violation for which a citation is issued and which is not corrected within the time period specified in subsection (n)(2) of this section shall be a new violation of this chapter, and every 72-hour period thereafter in which the violation is not corrected shall constitute a new violation. The citation shall include a notice to the alleged violator that each 24-hour period of noncompliance after the time period specified in subsection (n)(2) shall constitute a new violation and a new fine of up to $100.00. 
b.  The first selectman shall not be responsible for a daily reinspection. Rather, the person to whom the citation has been issued shall be responsible for reporting subsequent compliance by way of written report to the first selectman. The first selectman shall reinspect to confirm compliance within one business day of receipt of such report. 
(4)  Payment of fines. All fines imposed under this section which are uncontested shall be made payable to the town and shall be received by the first selectman within ten calendar days from date of notice of the citation. All fines collected by the first selectman shall be deposited into the town's general fund. 
(o)  Appeals. 
(1)  If the first selectman issues a notice of violation, the first selectman shall send written notice of action and a statement of the right to an appeal to the facility operator or facility owner. 
(2)  The facility operator or facility owner may appeal a notice of violation to the first selectman by setting forth in writing the reasons for the appeal within 15 calendar days after date of the notice of violation. 
(3)  The facility operator or facility owner may appeal the decision of the first selectman to the hearing officer as follows: 
a.  The facility operator or facility owner may file a written request for a review by paying an appeal fee of $25.00 and setting forth the reasons for the appeal within 20 calendar days after the date of notification of the decision from the first selectman. Appeal fees shall be returned to the appealing facility operator or facility owner if the appeal is upheld. 
b.  The hearing officer shall conduct a hearing within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the request. The hearing shall be informal in nature. The person requesting the hearing may testify concerning the facts, circumstances and nature of his/her appeal and may present supporting documentation. 
The hearing officer shall render a written decision within 15 calendar days of the hearing. The decision will affirm or reverse the decision of the first selectman. 
(4)  Filing of a request for appeal shall stay the action by the first selectman requiring payment of a surcharge until the hearing officer has completed his review. If a request for appeal is not made within the 20-calendar day period, the action of the first selectman is final. 
(p)  Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section, the first selectman may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. 
(q)  Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this section, the first selectman may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, watershed cleanup, or other related activities. 
(r)  Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this section is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
(s)  Criminal prosecution. Any person that has violated or continues to violate this section shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. The first selectman may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this ordinance, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
(t)  Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the first selectman to seek cumulative remedies.

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1.1 Authority
These Subdivision Regulations have been adopted by the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Portland in accordance with the authority conferred by Chapter 126 of the Connecticut General Statutes.
Section 1.2 Purpose
These Regulations are intended to achieve the following purposes:
a. that the land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety;
b. that proper provision shall be made for water, sewerage and drainage, including the upgrading of any downstream ditch, culvert or other drainage structure which, through the introduction of additional drainage due to such subdivision, becomes undersized and creates the potential for flooding;
c. in areas contiguous to brooks, rivers or other bodies of water subject to flooding, including tidal flooding, that proper provision shall be made for protective flood control measures;
d. that any streets within a proposed subdivision are in harmony with existing or proposed principal thoroughfares shown in the current Plan of Conservation and Development, especially in regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares, and so arranged and of such width, as to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs;
e. that open spaces, parks and playgrounds are provided when, and in places, deemed proper by the Commission.
f. that the subdivision does not impose burden on municipal services in excess of their capacity and planned expansion;
g. that buildings, lots, and streets are arranged to afford adequate light and air to all occupants, to facilitate fire protection, and to provide ample access to property for emergency apparatus;
2
h. that proper provisions are made to control erosion caused by wind or water and to control sedimentation;
i. that energy conservation techniques are considered for all subdivisions by designing energy efficient lot layouts and site development plans, and by using solar and other renewable forms of energy to the maximum extent possible and practical;
j. that the layout and infrastructure of the proposed subdivision will be consistent with the policies set forth in the current Plan of Conservation and Development and all applicable requirements in the Regulations for Public Improvements;
k. that the proposed subdivision will comply with all applicable Zoning Regulations;
l. that the proposed subdivision would not have, or be reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural or historic resources of the Town or the State; and
m. that the proposed subdivision would not unreasonably harm or destroy significant natural features of the landscape.
Section 1.3 Applicability
These Regulations shall apply to any subdivision of land (including any resubdivision of land) within the town of Portland.
Section 1.4 Approval of Subdivision Plans Required
No subdivision of land shall be made, and no land in any subdivision shall be sold or offered for sale, until a subdivision plan, prepared in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations, has been approved by the Commission, signed by the Chairman or other authorized agent to indicate such approval, and filed or recorded in the office of the Town Clerk within the time period specified in Section 8-25 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Subdivision plans that have been recorded without meeting the foregoing requirements may be deemed null and void.
Section 1.5 Modification of Subdivision Plans
No modifications may be made to a subdivision plan approved by the Commission unless an application for such modifications has been reviewed and approved by the
3
Commission. The requirements of this section shall apply to all plan modifications, regardless of whether they would constitute a resubdivision, as defined in Section 8-18 of the Connecticut General Statutes. If such modifications would constitute a resubdivision, the Commission must hold a public hearing on the application. If such modifications would not constitute a resubdivision, the Commission shall have the full discretion to determine whether the application should receive a public hearing.
Section 1.6 Responsibility for Subdivision Construction
The approval of a subdivision plan by the Commission entitles, but does not require, the landowner or its agents to construct the roads, drainage facilities, and other improvements shown on, or otherwise incorporated into, the approved subdivision plan, provided such construction also complies with all other provisions of these Regulations, as well as all other applicable provisions of Town, state and federal law. The approval of a subdivision plan by the Commission does not relieve the applicant of any obligations it may have under any such requirements. In addition, although these Regulations may authorize and empower public officials and their designees to inspect premises and work in progress or completed, and to order cessation and re-execution of work where work does not conform to the provisions of these Regulations, nothing in these Regulations shall be deemed to place any obligation on the Commission or the Town of Portland, or on any of their employees, officials, or agents to monitor or inspect any work on the subdivision, nor shall they be responsible for any means, methods, controls, techniques, sequences, procedures, or safety measures that the subdivider or its employees, agents or contractors may use in connection with such work.
Section 1.7 Consistency with State and Federal Law
These Regulations are intended to comply with all applicable provisions of state and federal law. In particular, many of the procedural requirements set forth in these Regulations are based solely on state requirements that were in effect at the time of adoption. In the event that state or federal law is later modified or is determined by a court to be inconsistent with any provisions of these Regulations, it is the intention of the Commission that the relevant provisions shall be deemed superseded by the applicable requirements of state or federal law and that those requirements shall be applied as though they were expressly incorporated herein.

CHAPTER 2. INTERPRETATION OF THE REGULATIONS
Section 2.1 General Provisions
For the purposes of these Regulations, the terms listed in Section 2.3 shall have the meanings given in that section, unless the context of a regulation in which such a term appears clearly requires a different interpretation, or unless the definition is controlled by a state or federal law that is currently different (see Section 2.2). When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in the plural number include the singular number, words in any gender (including neutral gender) include any other gender, and words in the singular include the plural. The words shall and must are mandatory, and the words may and should are discretionary. References to specific statutes or regulations shall be deemed to refer to those statutes or regulations as most recently amended or recodified unless the context clearly requires reference to an earlier version of the statute or regulation.
Section 2.2 Words and Terms Defined by State Law
State or federal law controls the definitions of some terms listed in Section 2.3. In such instances, the definitions provided in Section 2.3 are intended to be consistent with such controlling law or laws. If any definitions in the controlling laws have changed since the adoption of the definitions in Section 2.3, the earlier definitions will be deemed to be superseded by the current state or federal definitions.

Zoning Regulations: The current Town of Portland Zoning Regulations.
11
CHAPTER 3. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND
Section 3.1 Character of Land to be Subdivided
A. General Requirements. All land that is to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and without unreasonable risk of polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources or historic resources of the state.
B. Compliance with Zoning Regulations. The Zoning Regulations establish certain minimum dimensional and physical requirements for the lawful use of lots. Applicants for the approval of subdivision plans must show that each proposed lot, together with all proposed utilities and infrastructure, will satisfy, at a minimum, the applicable Zoning Regulations for the use of lots in the relevant zoning districts. The Commission may require, however, that the size of proposed lots be increased or that the shape of lots be modified if it finds that the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations cannot otherwise be satisfied.
C. Water Supply. Each lot that would not be served by a public water supply system must be capable of supporting an individual, on-site water supply system consistent with good engineering practice, the applicable requirements of the Public Health Code (including, but not limited to, Sections 19-13-B51a through 19-13-B51m of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies) and any other applicable governmental regulations
D. Sewage Disposal. Each lot that would not be served by a public sanitary sewerage system must have sufficient area and suitable dimensions to readily accommodate the proper layout and installation of an on-site sewage disposal system and required reserve area in accordance with good engineering practice, the applicable requirements of the Public Health Code, including the technical standards, and any other applicable governmental laws and regulations.
E. Flood and Erosion Protection. All subdivisions shall be designed so as to minimize exposure of property and improvements to damage by flooding and erosion.
12
Section 3.2 Subdivision Land Design
In addition to the other standards and criteria set forth in these Regulations, the following provisions and requirements shall apply to all applications for approval of a subdivision plan.
A. Energy Efficiency and Solar Access.
1. Energy Efficiency. Energy-efficient patterns of development and land use, the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy conservation are encouraged. The site design techniques should include but not be limited to: (a) house orientation; (b) street and lot layout; (c) vegetation; (d) natural and man-made topographical features; and (e) protection of solar access within the development.
2. Solar Access. In accordance with CGS Section 8-25(b), each applicant must demonstrate that such person, in developing the proposed subdivision plan, has considered using passive solar energy techniques that would not significantly increase the cost of the housing to the buyer, after tax credits, subsidies and exemptions.
B. Preservation of Natural Features. The general layout and design of the subdivision shall avoid, to the maximum extent possible, large scale changes in topography and watercourse locations. The applicant shall demonstrate a conscious effort to preserve and enhance natural features such as vegetation, natural watercourses, paths, scenic points, and other natural assets of the site. The felling of trees should be held to a minimum. The developer shall leave not less than two (2) naturally growing shade trees having a 2 1/2 inch or larger caliper in the front yard of each lot, or in the event that the trees do not presently exist the developer shall plant two such shade trees of similar caliper ten (10) feet from the front property line. The above shall be shown on the site development plan.
C. Lot Design.
1. General Layout. Building lots should be arranged and located to create and preserve unique characteristics for the actual building sites; to utilize the existing topography to a maximum degree; to maximize the environmental privacy of each building site; to provide each building site with safe and convenient vehicular access; and to avoid the use of land unsuitable for building sites, including, but not limited to bedrock, flood
13
plains and steep slopes.
2. Zoning Conformance. Each lot must be capable of being used in accordance with the applicable dimensional standards (e.g., lot frontage, area, front yard, rear yard, and side yard) of the Town of Portland Zoning Regulations. Each lot shall have its minimum frontage at the street line except to the extent interior lots are allowed in accordance with these Regulations.
3. Street Access.
a. Usable Frontage Requirement. All lots must have usable frontage on an accepted Town or State road or on a street proposed for public acceptance in the subdivision plan and meet the specifications for construction of driveways abutting Town highways as outlined in Town ordinances. For purposes of this subsection, the term usable frontage means frontage from which the applicant can demonstrate the availability of safe, legal and technically feasible vehicular access. For purposes of this subsection, vehicular access will be deemed technically feasible if the applicant demonstrates that a paved driveway could reasonably be installed, in accordance with subsection b, below, from the lots frontage to an interior location at which a home or other principal building could properly be constructed. If vehicular access from any lots road frontage would require crossing a wetland or watercourse, the applicant must obtain a permit for such crossing from the Town of Portland Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency in order to demonstrate that the access is usable, if the applicant plans to use this access point.
b. Driveway Location. In order to comply with subsection a, above, the potential driveway location used to demonstrate that the lot frontage is usable must comply with the applicable provisions of the Regulations for Public Improvements and meet the specifications for construction of driveways abutting Town highways as outlined in Town ordinances. In addition, no such driveway shall be located within 75 feet of the intersection of two (2) or more existing or proposed streets, and grades shall conform with requirements in the specifications for construction of driveways abutting Town highways as outlined in Town ordinances.
D. Water Supply and Sewage Disposal. Each lot must have sufficient area and suitable dimensions to provide code complying locations for a private water
14
supply system where public water supply is not available and for the proper layout, installation and future extension of a private sewage disposal system where public sewer systems are not available. See also Section 3.3 of these Regulations.
E. Lot Shape. Lots with generally square or rectangular shapes are preferred. Lots with unusual shapes should be avoided where feasible. For purposes of this subsection, the term lots with unusual shapes includes, but is not limited to, lots that are generally non-rectangular, narrow lots (e.g., lots having one dimension (e.g., length) more than three times the perpendicular dimension (e.g. width). The Commission may require subdivision plans to be modified to eliminate or reduce the number of unusual lot shapes if it finds that such shapes are not necessary to allow a reasonable use of the land to be subdivided. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from approving one or more lots with unusual shapes or irregular lot lines if the Commission finds that such shapes or lot lines will best fulfill the purposes set forth in Section 1.2 or these Regulations (for example, if the Commission finds that such shapes or lot lines will help protect or define desirable open space or conservation areas).
F. Lot Numbers. All lots shall be numbered beginning with the numeral 1 and shall continue consecutively throughout the entire subdivision with no omissions or duplications. No fractions or letters shall be used, even in the case of resubdivisions, in which case numbers of a higher order such as 101 or 1001 should be used. Adjoining subdivisions and sections of a subdivision having the same title shall not duplicate numbers but shall continue the sequence of numbers previously used for the adjoining land. All of the lot numbers shall be conspicuous and noted on the map in the approximate center of the lots.
G. Open Space. In approving, or modifying and approving, any subdivision plan, the Commission shall require the provision of open spaces, parks and playgrounds in locations deemed proper by the Commission. The following standards, criteria and procedures shall apply to each subdivision application:
1. Purpose of Open Space. A set-aside of open space may be necessary or desirable to achieve a variety of objectives, including the preservation of significant natural resources, including wetlands and water-related resources, as well as other environmentally important or sensitive lands and soils; the protection of scenic vistas and of historically and culturally
15
significant sites and features; and the provision of additional opportunities for passive or active recreation.
2. Need for Open Space. Subdivisions may create the need for additional open spaces, parks and playgrounds both by increasing the population density in local areas, thereby generating additional demand for such resources; and by producing additional environmental impacts through the alteration, removal and destruction of natural, cultural or historic resources and the establishment of additional sources of potential pollution, thereby requiring the amelioration of local impacts through the preservation and protection of certain portions of the land. In determining the proper location, amount and type of open space to be provided in any subdivision, the Commission shall consider the nature and scope of the impacts the subdivision is likely to generate.
3. Amount of Open Space to be Reserved. The Commission has determined that, on average, a set-aside of up to twenty percent of the land area of a subdivision represents a fair balance between the burdens to be created by the additional development, as described in subsection 3.2.G.2, and the land to be required for open spaces, parks or playgrounds to compensate for or ameliorate those burdens. Therefore, except as may otherwise be provided in these Regulations, a subdivision applicant must propose an open-space set aside of up to twenty percent of the area of the subdivision. Set-asides of less than twenty percent may be most appropriate when the land to be dedicated would otherwise be suitable for building purposes, as opposed to land that is subject to natural development restrictions, such as, but not limited to, wetlands or watercourses, steep slopes, rocky soils, or other factors that make such land inherently more suited to conservation or passive uses. The Commission shall not be bound by the applicants proposal, either as to the amount or location of the suggested open space area, if it finds that the specific physical conditions and circumstances of the subdivision require a greater or different area to be set aside.
4. Factors for Determining the Location of the Open Space Set-Aside. In determining whether to accept or modify any proposed location for an open-space set-aside, the Commission shall consider:
16
a. the physical character and quality of the proposed open space in terms of its value for active or passive recreation, including the ability to provide reasonable access to such areas;
b. the existence of, and need to protect, any significant natural, cultural, agricultural or historic resources on the site;
c. the special significance of any of the land in the subdivision to scenic or historic vistas worthy of preservation;
d. the existence, location and function of any open space areas on abutting parcels and the opportunity to connect the new open spaces to such areas;
e. recommendations in the Plan of Conservation and Development; and by the Conservation Commission;
f. the opportunity to preserve or protect significant natural resources;
g. accessibility of the open space;
h. any other relevant factors that may be brought to its attention by any person during the course of the Commissions proceedings on the subdivision application.
5. Percentage of Subdivision Area to be Set Aside. Each subdivision plan submitted for approval by the Commission must indicate a proposed open-space area having a percentage based on the criteria stated in subsection 3.2.G.3, above, unless one or more of the following circumstances exist:
a. Fee-in-Lieu of Open Space. The minimum set-aside may be reduced or eliminated if the applicant proposes a fee-in-lieu of open space in accordance with CGS Section 8-25.
b. Transfer of Other Land. The minimum set-aside may be reduced or eliminated if the applicant proposes to transfer other land to the Town of Portland, in accordance with CGS Section 8-25, in lieu of providing open space within the subdivision itself.
17
c. Potential for Substantial Resubdivision. The minimum set-aside may be reduced or eliminated if the subdivision as proposed would create fewer than fifty percent of the number of lots that could reasonably and practically be created in accordance with the lot densities allowed under the Zoning Regulations and the physical conditions of the land; i.e., if one or more future resubdivisions could reasonably be expected to result in more than two times the number of lots presently proposed. In such circumstances, the Commission may reduce the set-aside requirement on a proportional or roughly proportional basis. For example, if the applicant is proposing to create only thirty percent of the number of lots that could reasonably be created from the parcel to be subdivided, the Commission may accept a proposal to dedicate only three to six percent of the total area as open space for the current application. However, in order to avoid piecemeal dedication of small, less valuable open-space areas, the proposed subdivision plan must still designate a single area of up to twenty percent of the parcel to accommodate both the presently proposed open space set-aside and any future open-space areas that could ultimately be set aside upon resubdivision.
d. Existing Open Space Restrictions. The minimum set-aside may be reduced or eliminated if the property being subdivided is already subject to conservation or preservation restrictions that serve a purpose similar in nature to those described in subsection 3.2.G.1 and that would not be subject to termination or revocation by any one or more property owners in the subdivision or by lapse of time.
e. Parcels Smaller than Ten Acres. The minimum set-aside may be reduced or eliminated if the parent parcel is smaller than ten acres.
f. Lack of Benefit. The minimum set-aside may be reduced or eliminated if the Commission finds that a set-aside would not reasonably serve any of the purposes listed in subsection 3.2.G.1, whether because of the character of the land to be subdivided, the uses of the surrounding area, or other reasons. The Commission shall not reduce or eliminate the minimum set-aside under this subsection 3.2.G.5.f unless it states on the record its reasons for finding that such dedication would not serve any of the purposes listed in Section 3.2.G.1.
18
g. Commission Discretion. Nothing in subsections 3.2.G.5.a through 3.2.G.5.f shall be deemed to require the Commission to accept any specific proposal to dedicate less than ten percent of the land in a proposed subdivision for open-space purposes. The Commission may approve, modify and approve, or deny any such proposal in accordance with its findings as to the manner and extent to which the proposed dedication would meet or conflict with the standards and criteria of this Section 3.2.G.
6. Manner of Dedicating Open Space. Areas designated as open space shall generally be proposed for dedication to the Town of Portland. However, the Commission may accept a dedication in any one or more of the following manners if it finds that such alternate form of dedication would accomplish the purposes of this Section 3.2.G, and further provided that the legal status of the dedicated area as open space cannot be terminated without the express written consent of the Town of Portland:
1) The open space may be dedicated to the Town of Portland by deed;
2) The open space may be made subject to a conservation easement or similar form of protection, such easement or protection to be in favor of the Town of Portland as grantee or beneficiary;
3) The open space may be conveyed to a non-profit land conservation trust or corporation;
4) The open space may be owned in common by lot owners in the development, provided any restrictions on access to the open space are found to be consistent with the purposes of this Section 3.2.G.
Suitable legal agreements for any acceptable manner of dedication must be approved in form and content by the Commission and its legal counsel.
7. Use of Open Space Land. Open space land shall be preserved in its natural state except as the Commission may otherwise approve to accommodate designated conservation or recreational purposes. With the approval of the Commission, structures and facilities for recreational purposes, such as graded trails, signage, and parking areas, may be constructed. Except as the Commission may expressly approve in accordance with specific plans, open space land SHALL NOT be used for
19
the storage of equipment or deposition of debris and shall not be excavated, filled or regraded, and trees and shrubs shall not be removed.
8. Access to Designated Open Space. Any dedication of open space shall include a lawful route of access to such area consistent with the purposes of the dedication. When applicable, the Commission may require an applicant to provide a right-of-way for public access to open space areas that do not abut a public street. The area of such right-of-way shall not be included in the required open space area. The right-of-way shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide, but not greater than fifty (50) feet wide. The Commission may require that such right-of-way be leveled off and surfaced in a manner suitable for foot traffic or vehicular traffic.
H. Interior Lots. For existing subdivisions, the maximum number of interior lots allowed shall be in accordance with the following table:
1. Number of Interior Lots Permitted.
Total Number of Lots Interior Lots Allowed
1 - 3 lots 1 interior lot
4 - 19 lots 2 interior lots
20 - 24 lots 3 interior lots
More than 24 lots 1 additional interior lot for every 5 lots
Whenever a resubdivision involves a parent parcel from which one or more interior lots were previously created, the foregoing table shall be applied to the total number of lots that have cumulatively been created from such parent parcel. For example, if a parent parcel that was subdivided into four lots included two interior lots, and the landowner of the remaining area proposed to resubdivide it to create four more lots, no additional interior lots would be permitted because the cumulative number of lots created from the parent parcel would be only eight. New or unbuilt subdivisions are exempt from the lot number restrictions.
2. Landscaping of Interior Lots. A permanent continuous landscaped buffer strip shall be provided on the interior lot, excluding the access strip, set back at least twenty (20) feet from any lot line shared by a front lot and an interior lot. At least 50% of the required plantings shall consist of evergreen species at least six (6) feet in height and 1.5 inches in caliper, unless existing trees and shrubs, possibly augmented by additional
20
plantings, would provide an equivalent amount of privacy. The initial buffer strip landscaping shall be provided by the developer prior to the sale of any interior lot created by subdivision. The landscaping shall thereafter be maintained by the owner of the interior lot, and a restrictive covenant noting the obligation shall be recorded on any deed of conveyance of such lot. A notice of such restrictive covenant shall also be filed in the Land Records of the Town prior to endorsement of any record subdivision map.
3. Zoning Requirements. The Zoning Regulations of the Town of Portland may contain other requirements for the use of interior lots. Any such requirements must also be met in order for an interior lot to be approved in a proposed subdivision.
I. Conservation Subdivisions. To the extent authorized by the Zoning regulations, the Commission may approve a conservation subdivision, subject to the following standards and criteria:
1. The parcel to be subdivided must be no less than five acres in area.
2. A minimum of 33% of the property to be subdivided must be set aside as open space.
3. The following land characteristics shall be given preference for preservation:
a. Land occupied by a farming operation including pasture land.
b. Inland wetlands or watercourses as defined by the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations for the Town of Portland.
c. Structures or landscapes having historic or cultural value including archaeological sites.
d. Land along ridge lines, defined as areas lying in the upper half of the area above the mean elevation of the subregional watershed where the subject property is located. The subregional watersheds are defined on maps prepared by the Natural Resources Division of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
e. Land containing areas proposed as open space or recreational areas as shown in the Plan of Conservation and Development.
f. Land containing areas of special concern as identified by the Connecticut Natural Diversity Data Base as prepared by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
21
Habitats of species that are endangered, threatened, or considered by State or Federal agencies to be significant at the state level; and other ecologically unique or special areas.
g. Land containing one or more specimen trees, defined as trees having a diameter at breast height of 36 inches or more.
4. The location, configuration and manner of dedication of the open space areas shall be subject to the approval of the Commission in accordance with Section 3.2.G of these Regulations.
J. Impact on Future Development. Land shall not be subdivided in such a manner as to prejudice the convenient subdivision of adjoining lands. Sufficient street-width reserve parcels and slope rights shall be provided to allow reasonable access into adjoining lands and to promote safe, efficient, and convenient traffic movement, utility service, storm drainage, or other appropriate connections. The location of the access reserve parcels may be established or modified by the Commission, which may also require such reserve parcel to be designated as a future street on all subdivision plans. The Commission may require the developer to deed any reserve parcels to the Town of Portland if the Commission determines that such parcels would be necessary to continue a public street to adjoining property upon future development of that property.
Section 3.3 Design of Subdivision Improvements
A. Regulations for Public Improvements. In addition to all other provisions of these Subdivision Regulations, the Commission hereby adopts, and incorporates by reference herein, the Regulations for Public Improvements, as those regulations may pertain or be relevant to any activities proposed in a subdivision plan, including, without limitation, streets, drainage, landscaping, and sediment and erosion control measures.
B. Water Supply.
1. General Requirements. The proposed subdivision design must be proved capable of accommodating all infrastructure needed to supply potable water to each lot. Each lot to which a public water supply is not available must be designed to accommodate an on-site potable water supply. If historic, geologic, or other available information or data indicate that on-site water supplies may not be readily available due to pollution or other subsurface conditions, the Commission may require the applicant to install a test well or wells in order prove that a suitable water supply can be obtained. The applicant must also prove that sufficient water supplies
22
(e.g., hydrants, fire tanks) are available to provide timely and adequate fire-fighting capacity within the subdivision.
2. Public Water Supplies. The Commission shall require public water supply connections or extensions to be made available to each undeveloped lot in a subdivision if any portion of the parcel to be subdivided is located within 200 feet of an existing, legally available public water supply system. The developer shall be required to install a lateral water line to the lot line. The lateral water line shall enter the lot at a point which is approximately at the center of the lot frontage, unless the lot is shaped such that the house foundation would require the lateral service at a different point on the lot frontage.
C. Sewage Disposal.
1. General Requirements. The proposed subdivision design must be proved capable of accommodating all infrastructure needed to safely and lawfully dispose of sewerage. Each lot to which a public sewerage system is not available must be capable of accommodating an on-site sewage disposal system and required reserve area in accordance with good engineering practice, the applicable requirements of the Public Health Code, and any other applicable governmental laws and regulations. Approval of such design by the local health department.
2. Public Sewer Systems. The Commission shall not approve a subdivision plan proposing a connection to a public sewer line unless the applicant provides evidence that such connection has been or will be approved by the Town of Portland Department of Public Works. For each lot that would be connected to the public sewer system, the applicant shall be required to install the sanitary sewer line to the lot line for each lot in the subdivision.
D. Drainage Facilities. The proposed subdivision design must be proved to provide for adequate surface-water and subsurface drainage, including the upgrading of any downstream ditch, culvert or other drainage structure which, through the introduction of additional drainage due to the proposed subdivision, would become undersized and create the potential for flooding on any public street. In areas contiguous to brooks, rivers or other bodies of water subject to flooding, including tidal flooding, proper provision must be made for protective flood control measures.
23
E. Existing Streets. Whenever any subdivision abuts an existing public street having a right-of-way less than fifty feet wide, a strip of land abutting the existing right-of-way must be deeded to the Town to increase the width of the street right-of-way. The minimum width of the strip of land to be deeded to the Town for these purposes shall be one-half the difference between the existing width of the street right-of-way and the road width required by Section 70B of the Regulations for Public Improvements.
F. New Streets. In addition to the applicable requirements of the Regulations for Public Improvements, the following criteria and standards shall be applied to new streets or extensions of existing streets in a proposed subdivision:
1. General Design Principles. Proposed streets must be in harmony with existing or proposed thoroughfares shown in the Plan of Conservation and Development or otherwise established or determined by the Commission, especially in regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares. Proposed streets must be so arranged and of such width as to provide an adequate and convenient system for both present and prospective traffic needs.
2. Solar Access. Where new or extended streets are proposed, an east-west street layout, if feasible, is generally preferred to provide the optimum building orientation for solar access, especially for smaller lot sizes. However, east-west street layouts may be reasonably avoided if they would produce undesirable gradients or excessive disruption of the natural topography.
3. Intersections. See Section 70G of the Regulations for Public Improvements. Also, road block lengths shall generally not exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 600 feet.
4. Dead-End Streets. In addition to the requirements set forth in the Regulations for Public Improvements, the following criteria shall apply to proposed dead-end streets:
a. Dead-end streets shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length, as measured along the center line from the gutter line of the intersecting road, unless the Commission finds, based on evidence in the record, that the street is likely to be extended through an adjoining parcel to a second intersecting street upon future development of the adjoining parcel.
b. Dead-end street systems shall not be constructed in a manner that would require a motor vehicle to travel more than 1,200 feet from the intersection of origin to the most remote point of the street system, unless a greater length is authorized by the Commission because
24
of adverse topographical conditions, difficult site configuration, future road construction or other legitimate condition.
c. If the Commission finds that a proposed dead-end street should be, or is likely to be, extended to adjoining property in the future, the required turnaround circle shall be constructed with a street right-of-way width stub extension, and there shall be a notation on the plan stating that all segments of the turnaround outside of the normal road right-of-way shall revert to the record owners of adjacent properties at such time as the turnaround is eliminated. Such notation shall also be entered on the deeds for the lots affected. If a development includes land reverting back to abutting owners, the surplus pavement shall be removed and the area regraded and seeded at the developers expense.
d. Dead-end streets shall not be approved if there is sufficient land and suitable terrain to allow the street to have two connections with another existing or proposed street.
e. No more than three (3) driveways shall have any access through the arc of the turnaround right-of-way.
5. Street Trees. Street trees shall be provided in accordance with Section 120B.2 of the Regulations for Public Improvements unless the Commission finds that the applicant has the ability, and has proposed, to preserve a roughly equivalent number and quality of trees within the street right-of-way.
6. Private Streets. All new streets and extensions of existing streets in any proposed subdivision shall be required to meet the construction standards for public streets, as set forth in these Regulations. All new streets or extensions of streets proposed in a plan of subdivision shall be deemed to be proposed as public streets unless the applicant requests, in writing, that the streets be approved as private streets. The Commission shall consider the Plan of Conservation and Development and the potential need for public streets in determining whether to approve or deny requests for the approval of private streets.
G. Reserve Strips. Privately owned reserve strips will not be permitted if such reserve strips would control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use or for future development.
25
H. Storm Drainage.
1. General Design Principles. Storm drainage collection systems shall be installed along the frontage of the lots or parcels to collect all street runoff, to prevent flooding of roads and other properties, to minimize the possibility of road icing, and to prevent erosion and sedimentation off the site. Provisions must be made for the upgrading of any downstream ditch, culvert or other drainage structures which, through the introduction of additional drainage due to such subdivision, would become undersized and create the potential for flooding.
2. Construction Controls. Before construction commences soil and erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed and maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements in the Regulations for Public Improvements, including but not necessarily limited to the requirements of Sections 40B.9 and 110, and with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protections then-current General Permit for the Discharge of Stormwater from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems.
3. Drainage Construction Standards. See subsection 3.3.A.
I. Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided along all new streets or extensions of streets in a subdivision unless the Commission waives the requirement by a three-quarters vote of all of the members of the Commission. No such waiver may be granted unless the Commission finds (a) that, on existing streets that would be extended into the subdivision, there are no existing sidewalks to which the new sidewalks would be connected, and that the future construction of sidewalks on the existing portion of the street would be unlikely or undesirable; and (b) that an average of no more than two lots would be created for each additional 200 feet of new or extended street(s) to be constructed, and that the proposed lots could not later be further subdivided to exceed such average.
When required, sidewalks shall be installed in accordance with the following standards and Sections 70Q, 80M and the Standard Detail Drawings in the Regulations for Public Improvements:
1. Sidewalks shall be installed along the entire new or extended street frontage, including the circumference of any cul-de-sac.
2. In commercial zones, sidewalks shall be five (5) feet in width;
26
3. In residential and industrial zones sidewalks shall be four (4) feet in width;
4. On all streets that are within a one and one-half mile radius of a school or a library, sidewalks shall be four (4) feet in width;
5. Where an existing street with sidewalks is extended into a subdivision, the width of the new sidewalk shall be the greater of (a) the width of the sidewalk on the existing street, or (b) four (4) feet;
6. Sidewalks shall be constructed in the street right-of-way, except that, if a transition would be required to extend an existing sidewalk to conform to the above requirements, the Commission may choose either (a) to require the extended portion to conform to the location of the existing portion of the sidewalk, or (b) to specify an alternative sidewalk geometry to accommodate the transition over a reasonable distance.
J. Utilities. Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, the following provisions apply to all sewer, water, telephone, cable, electric, gas, and other utilities needed to serve the lots and parcels in a proposed subdivision:
1. Underground Installation Requirement. Except as provided below, electric and telecommunications utilities shall be installed in the ground unless the Commission finds that the physical conditions on the property would cause the installation to be substantially more costly than would otherwise be typical for such installation.
2. Underground Utility Locations. Underground utilities shall be located within the street right-of-way, as required in Section 70K and the Standard Detail Drawings in the Regulations for Public Improvements.
3. Fire Tanks. Unless the Commission finds that the proposed subdivision would be adequately served by existing, nearby fire suppression and control facilities already available to the subdivision, the applicant shall include, as part of the subdivision plans, the construction of fire tanks and appurtenant structures, such as dry hydrants, in any subdivision containing 15 or more lots or in any commercial or industrial zoning district not having access to the public water supply for the purpose of fire protection. On or before the day on which the applicant submits the relevant subdivision application to the Commission, the applicant shall
27
submit a copy of the plans for construction of the fire suppression facilities to the Chief of the Fire Department in which the subdivision is located.
K. Easements and Rights-of-Way. Permanent easements shall be granted or obtained for access to and use of all land associated with subdivision improvements located outside the street right-of-way. All such easements shall be shown on the record subdivision map with adequate survey information to accurately locate the easement or right-of-way in the field. All easements and rights-of-way shall be filed on the Land Records prior to the endorsement of the final subdivision approval. Subdivision improvements that require easements or rights-of-way include but are not limited to the following types:
1. Construction and Maintenance. All bridges, culverts, permanent sediment and erosion control measures, storm water retention structures, and recreational facilities shall be located within an easement granted to the Town in order to allow for necessary repairs and maintenance. The easement shall be large enough to accommodate the entire structure or facility and appurtenances, and to allow reasonable room for appropriate repair equipment to be maneuvered.
2. Access. Bridges, culverts, permanent erosion and sediment control measures, stormwater retention structures and public recreational facilities shall have access easements for construction and maintenance equipment. Access easements shall be graded and cleared suitably for use by the appropriate equipment.
3. Utilities. Water mains, sanitary sewers, all other utilities and all related appurtenances located outside of the street right-of-way shall be subject to utility easements for use and access. The easements shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet wide, be substantially centered on the utility, and be centered on or parallel to property lines whenever possible.
4. Shoulders and Slopes. Shall conform to the requirements in Section 70I in the Regulations for Public Improvements.
5. Sight Lines- Shall conform to the requirements in Section 70G in the Regulations for Public Improvements. Sight line easements across corners of lots at intersections shall be required to assure safe lines of sight for motorists. Bushes, hedges, fences, walls, and other obstructions over 2.5 feet in height, as well as tree branches hanging less than six (6) feet high, are prohibited. The size
28
of the easement shall be based upon the required sight distances and general site characteristics.
6. Pedestrian Walkways. Pedestrian walkway easements shall be required for walkways entering parks, playgrounds, school sites, and other public or semi-public places where the road system does not conform to a convenient pattern for pedestrian circulation and to open space and recreation areas within subdivisions. Pedestrian easements shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide, suitably graded and located so as to promote pedestrian usage.
7. Storm Drainage. Drainage easements shall be provided for all parts of the storm drainage system that are located outside of the street right-of-way. Where it is necessary to drain a public street across lands included in the subdivision, the plans shall provide an easement for the discharge of water in favor of the Town of Portland. Such easements shall be recorded on the Land Records prior to the conveyance of the lots affected by such easement. Where necessary to discharge water from a public right-of-way across private lands not included in the subdivision, the developer must obtain any necessary legal rights for the Town of Portland to initiate and permanently maintain such discharge from the relevant landowners. See also Section 90A.8 of the Regulations for Public Improvements.
L. Monuments.
1. General Requirements. Monuments shall be placed along new streets or extensions of existing streets in accordance with Section 70N of the Regulations for Public Improvements. The Commission may require additional monumentation or property markers to delineate easements provided to the Town pursuant to these Regulations. Property markers shall be set at all property corners that are not identified by street monuments.
2. Monument and Property Marker Specifications.
a. Property markers shall consist of iron pipes or iron or steel bars at least thirty-six (36) inches long and not less than three-quarters (3/4) of an inch in diameter.

30
CHAPTER 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS FOR APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLANS
Section 4.1 Requirement of Approved Subdivision Plan
No subdivision of land shall be made and no land in a subdivision shall be sold or offered for sale until such time that a subdivision plan, prepared in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations, has been approved by the Commission and filed in the Office of the Town Clerk.
Section 4.2 Pre-Application Review
Before filing a formal subdivision application, a prospective applicant may request that the Commission conduct an informal, pre-application review of preliminary plans for the subdivision. The purpose of a pre-application review is to provide for an exchange of ideas between the applicant, the Commission and, potentially, other local officials. Discussing subdivision designs in the formative stages helps to assure coordination with the goals of the Plan of Conservation and Development and to assure that the applicant is aware of all pertinent regulations and any other considerations that may be appropriate for the land being subdivided. There are no specific requirements for the level of detail that must be provided during a pre-application review, but a greater amount of detail will enable the Commission to provide more specific feedback to the potential applicant. The Commission will not vote on any pre-application submission. In accordance with CGS Section 7-159b, any comments or feedback given by Commission members or staff in response to a pre-application submission shall be for purposes of discussion only and shall not be deemed binding in any manner on the Commission if an application is later submitted, regardless of whether such application is consistent with all pre-application submissions.
Section 4.3 Formal Subdivision Applications
A. Application Forms. Formal applications for approval of subdivision plans shall be made to the Commission in writing on such forms as may be prescribed by the Commission.

Whenever a subdivision application is filed for a parcel of land that abuts or includes land in an adjoining municipality, the Commission shall, before deciding on the application, give written notice of the subdivision plan to the regional council of governments for the region or regions in which Portland and the other municipality are located. Such notice shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by electronic mail to the electronic mail address designated by the regional council of governments on the councils Internet web site for receipt of such notice, not later than 30 days before any public hearing to be held in relation thereto or, if no public hearing is to be held, no later than 30 days before rendering a decision on the application.

2. Modification of Subdivision Applications by Applicant. The subdivision application as originally submitted to the Commission, including all plans provided at the time of submission, shall be the application on which the Commission renders its decision. If the applicant wishes to amend or modify the application or plans after the date of receipt of the application, it may choose either (i) to withdraw the pending application and submit a new application with the proposed revisions; or (ii) submit the proposed modified plans to the Commission as part of the pending application, in which case the Commission will treat such submission as a proposal to modify and approve the original application in accordance with Section 5.2.B.2 of these Regulations. The purpose of this provision is to assure that the Commission has an adequate amount of time to consider any proposed revisions. If the Commission finds that any proposed revisions would modify the application in a substantial way, and that such revisions were proposed too late in the application process for the Commission to give them adequate consideration, the Commission may refuse to consider such revisions and may deny the application as originally submitted.
3. Consideration of Subdivision Application by Commission. The Commission may approve, modify and approve, or disapprove any subdivision application or maps and plans submitted therewith, including existing subdivisions made in violation of these Regulations or of state law. The Commissions decision shall be based upon its findings of the extent to which the proposed subdivision plans satisfy the applicable provisions of these Regulations. The Commissions decision shall be based solely upon the information provided during the administrative proceedings (including any public hearing) on the application. In rendering their decision, Commission members may use any information within their particular individual knowledge, provided such information is disclosed on the administrative record prior to rendering the decision and the applicant is given an opportunity to respond. If a public hearing is held, such information should be disclosed before the hearing is closed.
4. Modification of Subdivision Application by Commission. The Commission may modify any element of a subdivision plan to conform to the standards and requirements of these Regulations and may approve such plan as so modified. Such modifications may involve, for example, the alteration of the size, shape, location, and boundaries of lots or the elimination of such lots for use as building sites in which case the Record Subdivision Map shall be appropriately revised. Whenever the Commission shall modify and approve a plan of subdivision, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to prepare and
44
file revisions of all documents as deemed necessary to reflect such modification with the Commission. No Record Subdivision Map shall be endorsed or delivered to the applicant until all such revisions have been received by the Commission. The Commission shall require whatever layout changes it feels are necessary to eliminate or improve any problems relating to health, fire safety, traffic safety, storm drainage, and the provision of future streets in accordance with these Regulations. Such requirements may include:
a. Traffic signs, control facilities, and area lighting;
b. Improvement of sight distances;
c. Conformance to Plan of Conservation and Development street plan;
d. Reduction of number of driveways on streets designated as arterial by the Plan of Conservation and Development or as arterial or collector streets in these Regulations;

g. Sidewalks; and
h. Any other improvements the Commission may deem necessary to promote public health and safety and to safeguard the Town from undue expense in regard to the future maintenance of the subdivision infrastructure as required in in the Regulations for Public Improvements.
5. Performance Security.
a. General Requirements. To assure that the physical fulfillment of an approved subdivision will conform to the approved plans and other required documents, a performance bond or other financial guarantee may be required by the Commission. When performance security is required, it shall be posted prior to the endorsement of the record subdivision map and site development plans and the issuance of any zoning permits. No construction work shall be started prior to the final approval of the site development plans.
b. Form of Security. The Commission shall accept cash bonds, passbook or statement savings accounts and other financial guarantees other than surety bonds including, but not limited to, letters of credit, provided such financial guarantee is in a form acceptable to the Commission and that the financial institution or other entity issuing any letter of credit is acceptable to the Commission.
45
c. Amount of Security. The amount of the performance security shall be established by the Commission. Applicants shall furnish the Commission with a listing of the estimated quantities of materials needed to complete all required improvements. The security shall cover the full cost of the improvements as if let-to-bid by the Town without advantages of on-site building materials or the sale of removed earth material. In addition, the security shall include an amount to cover the escalation of all improvement costs over a two-year period.
d. Items Included by Security. The amount of the performance security shall be sufficient to cover the cost of any proposed or required site improvement such as street grading; roadway paving and street planting; the installation of curbs, gutters, storm drainage facilities, landscaping, sidewalks, monuments, bridges, and culverts; erosion and sediment control measures; site stabilization measures; and all other such improvements. All improvements shall be designed in accordance with established standards, rules and regulations applicable in the Town of Portland. The Commission may require a separate cash performance bond be posted for all erosion and sediment control and site stabilization measures.
6. Conditional Approval. In lieu of either the completion of any subdivision work or the furnishing of performance security as provided in Section 5.2.C.5 of these Regulations, the Commission may authorize the filing of a plan with a conditional approval endorsed thereon. Such approval shall be conditioned on (1) the actual construction, maintenance and installation of any improvements or utilities prescribed by the Commission, or (2) the provision of performance security as provided in Section 5.2.C.5. Upon the occurrence of either of such events, the Commission shall cause a final approval to be endorsed on the approved plans in the manner provided by Section 5.3.C.2 of these Regulations. Any such conditional approval shall lapse five years from the date it is granted, provided the applicant may apply for and the Commission may, in its discretion, grant a renewal of such conditional approval for an additional period of five years at the end of any five-year period.

SECTION 1. Title and Authority
(a) Aquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public drinking water. for
the State of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will increase as the population grows and
opportunities for new surface water supplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and
increasingly intense development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have
(b)
(c)
been contaminated by certain land use activities, and others are now threatened. To address
this problem, Connecticut has established· the Aquifer Protection Area Program
(Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a tq §22a-354bb) to identify critical water supply
aquifers and to protect them from pollution by managing land use. Protection requires
coordinated responsibilities shared by the state, municipality and water companies to ensure
a plentiful supply of public drinking water for present and future generations. It is therefore
the purpose of these regulations to protect aquifer protection areas within the Town of
Portland by making provisions for:
(1) implementing regulations consistent with state regulations and An Act Concerning
Aquifer Protection Areas, Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb
("the Act");
(2) delineating aquifer protection areas on the city/town zoning or inlanq wetland and
watercourse areas maps;
(3) regulating land use activity within the aquifer protection area including: prohibitfug
certain new activities; registering existing regulated activities; and issuing pennits for
new regulated activities at registered facilities; and
(4) administering and enforcing these regulations.
These regulations shall be known as the Aquifer Protection Area Regulations (the "AP A
Regulations") of the Town of Portland.
These regulations were adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance.
with the provisions of §22a-354p of An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, the
Connecticut General Statutes §22a-354a to §22a-354bb and the Regulations of Connecticut
State Agencies §22a-354i-1 through §22a-354i"10.
(d) The Planning & Zoning Commission of the Town of Portland is established as the Aquifer
Protection Agency (the "Agency") in accordance with the "Ordinance for the Establishment
of an Aquifer Protection Agency," (the "APA Ordinance") effective July 11, 2005, and
shall implement the purposes and provisions of the AP A Ordinance and the Act.
( e) The Agency shall administer all provisions of the Act and shall apprqve or deny

Section 1 Title and Authority
l. l The inland wetlands and watercourses of the State of Connecticut are an indispensable and
irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed.
The wetlands and watercourses are an interrelated web of nature essential to an adequate supply
of surface and underground water; to hydrological stability and control of flooding and erosion; to
the recharging and purification of groundwater; and to the existence of many forms of animal,
aquatic and plant life. Many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in
danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition, filling or removal of
material, the diversion or obstruction of water flow, the erection of structures and other uses, all
of which have despoiled, polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses. Such unregulated
activity has had, and will continue to have, a significant, adverse impact on the environment and
ecology of the state of Connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the
environment thus adversely affecting the ecological, scenic, historic and recreational values and
benefits of the state for its citizens now and forever more. The preservation and protection of the
wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses,
disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety
of the citizens of the state. It is, therefore, the purpose of these regulations to protect the citizens
of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the
inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; maintaining and
improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local
authority; preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation; preventing loss of fish and other
beneficial aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation and the destruction of the natural habitats
thereof; deterring and inhibiting the danger of flood and pollution; protecting the quality of
wetlands and watercourses for their conservation, economic, aesthetic, recreational and other
public and private uses and values; and protecting the state's potable fresh water supplies from the
dangers of drought, overdraft, pollution, misuse and mismanagement by providing an orderly
process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the
need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the
state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and
enjoyment of generations yet unborn.

4.2.2	Application of Density Factor

A.	Parcels proposed for residential use shall observe the density factors in Table 4.2.1. These factors shall be applied to parcels of land proposed for residential use to determine the maximum number of permitted lots. The calculation shall be applied as follows:

1.	Controlling density factor times net buildable area equals maximum lots permitted.


Illustration of Density Factor Computation  Parcel Zoned RR
	
Total Parcel	100 Acres
Area of Wetlands	5 Acres
Area of Steep Slopes	1 Acre
Area of Flood Plain	4 Acres
Total Excludable Area	10 Acres
Net Buildable Area	90 Acres
Density Factor	0.73
Total Lot Yield	66 Lots *
*  Yields that are fractional shall be rounded up or down to
the  nearest whole number	

B.	The density factor shall not apply to subdivisions or re-subdivisions of 4 or less total lots with frontage on an existing public street.

C.	The Commission may, through granting of a special permit, allow an increase of up to 15% of the applicable density requirement under the following conditions.

1.	The configuration of the property is such that the additional density can readily be accommodated on the site without the necessity of introducing either rear lots or lots of unusual configuration, i.e., lots that are not generally rectangular in configuration, and/or existing  public  road  frontage  is  such  that  the  additional  density  can  readily  be
 


accommodated on the site without the necessity of introducing either rear lots or lots of unusual configuration, i.e., lots that are not generally rectangular in configuration.

2.	Wetlands, water bodies, flood plains, and slopes in excess of 25% are situated on the site such that the additional density can readily be accommodated on the site without encroaching upon these resources.

D.	As part of the application for a special permit, the applicant shall submit a plan which complies with the applicable density standard and an alternate plan that shows the desired increase in density. Submitted plans shall comply with the requirements of Section 03.05.02 of the Subdivision Regulations.

4.2.3	Requirements Based on Availability of Utilities

The availability of public water and/or public sewer shall be a factor when computing minimum lots sizes within the Town of Portland. Minimum lot sizes as dictated by the availability of public utilities shall comply with Table 4.2.3. However, should the minimum zoning requirements of Table 4.2.1 exceed the lot size requirements based upon the availability of public utilities, the minimum requirements of Table
4.2.1 shall be complied with.

B.	In areas where no public water or sewer exist, it is recognized that occupancy of a two-family dwelling may at some time place additional demands on the subsurface sewage disposal system through increases in water usage. Prior to granting an approval for a two-family dwelling, the Portland Sanitarian must verify to the Commission that the building lot can satisfy all the current requirements of the Connecticut Public Health Code for subsurface sewage disposal.

C.	In addition to the Site Plan review requirements specified in Article 10, the applicant shall submit architectural renderings and/or elevations, an exterior facade materials list, landscaped yard area and any other information the Commission may feel essential to accompany the application.

Section 7.4  Flood Plain Zone/Special Flood Hazard Area Regulations

7.4.1	Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose, Objectives & Severability

A.		Statutory Authorization: The Legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Title 7, Chapter 98, Section 7-148(c)(7)(A) and in Title 8, Chapter 124, Section 8-2 of the General Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizemy. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Cormnission of the Town of Portland, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:


B.		Findings of Fact: The flood hazard areas of the Town of Portland are subject to periodic flood inundation which could result in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection  and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community.


c.	Statement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this regulation  to  regulate  floodplain  development, promote public health, safety, and general welfare,  and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

1.	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion  hazards,  or which  result  in damaging  increases  in erosion  or  in flood heights  or velocities;

2.	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

3.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;


7-4	PORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS
 

4.	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and

5.	Prevent  or regulate the construction  of flood barriers which  will unnaturally  divert  flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.


D.	Objectives:  The objectives of this regulation are:

1.	To protect human life and health;

2.	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

3.	To minimize  the need  for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

4.	To minimize prolonged business interruptions;

5.	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;	·

6.	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;

7.	To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area; and

8.	To  ensure  continued   eligibility   of  owners  of  property  in  the  Town  of  Portland  for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

E.		Severability: If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of these regulations should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of these regulations, which shall remain in full force and effect; and to this end  the provisions of these regulations are hereby declared to be severable.

The special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Portland dated August 28, 2008 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated August 28, 2008, and any subsequent revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by reference into  the regulation it must take precedence when more restrictive  until such time as a map amendment is obtained.

c.	Establishment of the Flood Hazard Area Permit
As per Zoning Regulation Section 11.1.1, an application for a Zoning Permit shall be required prior to the commencement of any development activities.

1.	Permit Expiration: Permits issued under these regulations shall expire if actual construction of a permitted structure does not connnence within 180 days of the permit approval date, or if for good cause shown, a 180 day extension is granted prior to the expiration of the original permit.

D.   Compliance
No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, modified or structurally altered without full compliance with the tenns of these regulations and other applicable regulations.

E.	Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
This Regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where these regulations and another conflict  or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
 

F.	Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of these regulations,  all provisions shall be: 1) considered as minimum requirements; 2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and; 3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

G.	Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this Regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses pennitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Portland or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.

6.	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the system into flood waters;

7.	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and

8.	In any portion of a watercourse which is altered or relocated, the flood carrying capacity shall be maintained.

9.	Accessory Structures:

a.	In Zones A and AE, the requirement  of Sections 7.4.6.C.2.a  and 7.4.6.C.2.b shall not apply to the following:

 





7-14
 
l)	A one-story attached garage, provided said garage is not an integral pa1t of a residential structure, and that any upper loft floors shall neither be accessible, nor reasonably modified to be accessible, from the residential structure. In addition, the

PORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS
 
ARTICLE 7: OVERLAY ZONES

use of any such upper loft floor shall be limited solely for storage purposes;

2)	Accesso1y  buildings,  which  are less that  401  square feet in floor area  and are accessory to a residential structure; and

3)	One-story row garages located on a lot in a residential district containing multiple dwelling units.

b.	Accessory buildings and attached garages as defined in Section 7.4.6.A.9 shall conform to the following:

1)	Shall not be used for human habitation;

2)	Shall be designed to have low flood damage potential and constrncted with flood resistance materials below the base flood elevation;

3)	Shall be constrncted and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;

4)	Shall be fimtly anchored to prevent flotation which may result in damage to their strnctures;

5)	Shall have all service facilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within components during conditions of flooding or elevated above base flood elevation; and

6)	There shall be no basement or excavated area  below  any accessory building  or garage.


10.	Manufactured Homes:  Manufactured homes are prohibited in all special flood hazard areas.

11.	Aboveground Oil Tanks: Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.) which are located outside or inside of the strncture must either be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.

12.	Portion of Strncture in Flood Zone: If any portion of a structure lies within the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The entire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other structure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire strncture to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone.

13.		Strnctures in Two Flood Zones: If a  strncture lies within two or more flood zones, the constrnction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., VE zone is more restrictive than AE zone; strncture must be built to the highest BFE). The strncture includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other strncture attached to the main strncture. (Decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more restrictive zone.)

14.	Equal Conveyance: Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as designated  on the Flood  fusurance Rate Map  (FIRM)  for the community,  encroachments resulting from filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint  of the  strncture,  are prohibited  unless the applicant  provides  certification  by  a

PORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS	7-lS
 

registered professional engineer demonstrating, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood elevation). Work within the floodplain and the land adjacent to the floodplain, including work to provide compensatory storage shall not be constructed in such a way so as to cause an increase in flood levels or flood velocity.

15.	Compensatory Storage: The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas that are tidally influenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction, or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint to the structure shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from adjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously used for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the municipality.

B.	Standards for Stream without Established Base Flood Elevations, Floodways and/or Flood Mapping

1.	The Town Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available  from a Federal, State or  other source, including data developed pursuant to Section 7.4.5.D.l.f or Section 7.4.7.D of these regulations as c1iteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the Community's FIRM meet the standards in 7.4.6.C.

2.	In A zones where base flood elevations have been determined, but before a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted which will increase base flood elevations more than one foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.

3.		The Town Engineer may request floodway data of an applicant for watercourses without FEMA-published floodways. When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is available from any other source, in response to the Town's Engineer request or not, the Town of Portland shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point along the watercourse.

4.	The Town Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in any area of potential, demonstrable or historical flooding within  the community meet the standards in Section 7.4.6.C.

c.	Specific Standards


In all special flood hazard areas A and AE, where base flood elevation data has been provided, the following provisions shall apply in addition to all general standards contained in Section 7.4. 6.A.


1.	Residential construction: New construction or substantial improvement of any existing residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least to the base flood elevation.

2.	Non-Residential Construction:


7-16	PORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS
 
ARTICLE 7: OVERLAY ZONES

a.	New constrnction or  substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or  non­ residential structure located in Zone A or AE, shall have the lowest floor,  including basement, elevated at least to the base flood elevation; or

b.	Non-residential structures located in all A and AE zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that together with all attendant utilities and sarutary facilities the areas of the structure below the required elevation are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall review and/or develop structural design specifications and plans for the construction, and shall ce1tify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the Portland Town Engineer.


3.	Fully-Enclosed Areas Below Base Flood Elevation:

New construction or substantial improvements of buildings in A and AE Zones that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation, excluding basements, shall be designed to preclude firushed living space and designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.

a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum critetia:

I)	Provide a mirumum of two  operungs having  a total net area of not  less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

2)	The bottom of all openings shall be not higher than one foot above the slab elevation and set at or above the exterior ground elevation so as to pennit free drainage away from the structure;

3)	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings  or devices provided  they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. Other cove1ings must be designed and certified by an engineer and approved by the Portland Town Engineer.

b.	Electrical, plumbing, HVAC (including duct work) and other utilities, including fuel oil tanks, are prohibited below the base flood elevation; and

c.	Use of the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises or entry to the living area via a stairway or elevator.

4.	Manufactured (Mobile) Homes and Recreational Vehicles

a.	Manufactured (Mobile) Homes are prohibited in all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs). This includes SFHAs in a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.

b.	Recreational Vehicles are prohibited in all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).
PORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS	7-17
 
5.	Floodways

Located within special flood hazard areas established in Section 7.4.3.B are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris and potential projectiles and  have erosion potential, no encroachments, including fill, new constrnction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless  certification, along with suppmiing technical data provided by a registered professional engineer is submitted demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. Fences located in the floodway must be aligned with the flow and be of an open design.

a.	A permit may be given which allows encroachments resulting in increases in base flood elevations provided the community first obtains a conditional floodway revision by meeting the requirement ofC.F.R. 44, Chapter l, Subsection 65.12.

6.	Critical Facilities:  New construction of critical facilities shall be elevated or dry floodproofed to two feet above the base flood elevation(! 00-year flood elevation).



7.4.7	Standards for Subdivision Proposals:

Inall special flood hazard areas the following requirements shall apply:


A.	All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

B.		All subdivision proposals that have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;

c.	All subdivision proposals shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards;

o.		All subdivision proposals shall provide the boundary of the SFHA, the floodway boundary, and the base flood elevation; and

E.		Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which are five acres or fifty lots, which ever occurs first, and are located in Zone A.

7.4.8	Variance Procedures

The Town of Portland Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of these regulations.


A.	The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Enforcement Officer under the direction of the Town Engineer in the enforcement or administration ofthis Regulation.

B.	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals or any person owning land which abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet (!00) of the land in question may appeal within 15 days after such decision to the State Superior Court of the Middletown Judicial District as provided in Section 8-8 of the General Statutes of Connecticut.

c. A variance issued under these regulations shall become effective as such time as is fixed by the Zoning Board of Appeals, provided a copy thereof shall be filed in the Office of the Portland Town


7-18	PORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS
 
ARTICLE 7: OVERLAY ZONES

Clerk and in the land records of the Town of Portland in the same marmer as reqnired for filing of variances from zoning regnlations.

o.	Specific Situation Variances

1.	Buildings on an Historic Register

Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National  Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation.

2.	Functionally-Dependent  Uses


Variances  may  be  issued  for  new  construction  and  substantial  improvement  and  other development necessaiy for the conduct of a functionally  dependent permitted use provided the structure or other development  is protected  by methods  that minimize  flood damage, creates  no  additional  threat  to  safety  and meets  the requirements  of  Sections 7.4.8.F. l 7.4.8.F.4.

3.	Floodway Prohibition


Variances  shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.


E.	Considerations for Granting of Variances


In passing upon such applications for variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the items listed below as 7.4.8.E. l - 7.4.8.E. l 1. Upon consideration of these factors and the purposes of this Regulation, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Regulation.


1.	.	The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2.	The danger to life and property due to flooding or other erosion damage;

3.	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4.	The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5.	The necessity of the facility to waterfront  location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;

6.	The availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use;

7.	The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8.	The relationship  of  the proposed  use to the comprehensive  plan  of  development  and  the floodplain management program for that area;

9.	The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10.	The expected  heights, velocity,  duration, rate of rise and sediment  transport  of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and


PORTLAND ZONING REGULATIONS	7-19
 
ARTICLE 7: OVERLAY ZONES
11.	The costs of providing governmental services during and  after flood conditions  including maintenance and repair  of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
F.	Criteria for Variances


I.	Variances shall only be used upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the 1ninimum necessary as not to destroy the histmic character and design of the building and result in the loss of historic designation of the building. Variances pertain to a piece of prope1ty and are not personal in nature. A properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the regulation would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. For example, economic or financial hardship is not sufficient cause for a variance, nor are inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or disapproval of one's neighbors. Use variances are specifically prohibited.

2.	Variances shall only be used upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will  not result  in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, damage the rights or property values of other persons in the area, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws, regulationss or regulations. Only hardships that are based on unusual or unique physical characteristics of the property in question, characteristics that are not shared by adjacent parcels, shall quality to meet subsection (ii) above. Claims of hardship based on the structure, on economic gain or loss, or on personal or self-created circumstances are not sufficient cause for the granting of a variance.

3.	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation (BFE) and the elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation.

f.	For Quarry/Mining Operations - the existing grade shall be maintained for a distance of 25 feet parallel to the property line from the top (cut) or toe (fill) of slope. Excavation occurring from 25 to  50 of a property line or street line
shall maintain a slope of 3:1 horizontal:vertical). When deemed appropriate by
the commission and where a joint agreement between property owners has been filed with the Commission, an excavation may be allowed to adjoin adjacent properties when such adjoinment will not create a hazard and will provide a more harmonious blend of graded land.
g.	No building or structure shall be erected in the disturbed/active area on the lot during earthwork except temporary shelter for machinery and portable sanitary
facilities, subject to approval by the Commission. For Quarry/Mining
Operations, structures typically required for these operations such as weigh stations and office should be shown on the operations plans reviewed and approved as part of the Special Permit.
h.	At all states of the operation, and upon completion, proper drainage shall be provided to prevent collection and stagnation of water and prevention of harmful  effects upon surrounding properties through soil erosion or interference with Wetlands or watercourses, as specified in the Environmental and Performance Standards of these Regulations.
i.	The plans shall provide that all access roads from the project to public highways or streets maintain a combined 50 foot crushed stone construction entrance (CT Guidelines for Erosion and Sediment Control) and 50 foot paved entrance/egress to minimize tracking of soil onto Town and State Roads.

k.	Whenever any owner, developer or excavator shall remove topsoil in or upon any land in town, and is to store said topsoil, provisions shall be made for the storage of said topsoil within the boundary of said property. Disturbance within the preservable section of the area shall be minimized to avoid erosion, loss of vegetation and windblown material products by means of a seeded cover crop or other organic mesh covering or seeding process. Topsoil to be used for purposes of the implementation of a Site Development Plan/Subdivision or Reclamation Plan must be maintained on site.
l.	Except as hereinafter provided, when topsoil is stored, it shall be uniformly replaced over the entire site or surface of the land on or before the completion date set forth in the soil removal Special Permit so that the final grades of said replaced topsoil shall conform to the proposed final grades shown on the topographic map. In the case of filling operations, a layer of topsoil shall be uniformly placed over the area to conform to proposed final grades.
m.	Due to the extended period of operation and long term impact on surrounding uses, removal, filling, grading or hauling from any approved project shall only occur between the hours of 7 am to 6 pm Monday thru Friday There shall be no removal, filling, grading, or hauling on Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays.

(By way of example, 125,000 square feet of commercial/retail establishment would require that not less than 25 housing units nor more than 75 housing units be included in the MUD.) Residential units in a MUD shall consist of studio, one, or two bedroom units only, with a maximum of 55% as two-bedroom units. Under no circumstances shall a MUD contain more than 240 residential units.

In the event that a Mixed Use Development incorporates the preservation of significant historic resources identified in the Towns Plan of Conservation and Development, the ratio between residential and commercial uses shall be not less than one (1) residential unit for each 5,000 square feet of commercial/retail establishment nor more than sixteen (16) residential units for each 5,000 square feet of commercial development.

9.17.5	Standards and Requirements

A.	Waiver: Those sections of the Portland Zoning Regulations which otherwise conflict with this section are deemed to be waived and superseded by the Final Development Plan for the Mixed Use Development when an approval is granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. In particular, the Commission may waive Minimum Yard requirements, except as otherwise noted in Section 9.17.5.E., buffer requirements (Section 8.1.2), RMD Zone requirements (Section 4.3), Off-street Parking requirements (Section 8.2), and Alcoholic Liquor requirements (Section 3.2) when requested in writing by the applicant and provided that the Commission is provided with information demonstrating that the unique design and mixed uses within the MUD justify the waiving of such regulations without creating hazards for public health, safety or welfare. The applicant shall be required to demonstrate that the development of the MUD shall not create any adverse impacts on abutting residential uses or residentially zoned properties.

B.	Lights: Outdoor Lighting shall be shielded and directed so that the direct light source shall not be seen at the property line of adjacent properties or from the view of streets and highways abutting the property. No direct light shall fall outside the MUD and all indirect light falling outside the MUD shall be less than 1 lumens increase over existing ambient lighting. The lighting plan shall demonstrate compliance with the standards of Section 8.3 of the Regulations.

C.	Drainage: Drainage design and improvements shall comply with Section 8.6 of these regulations.

D.	Building Coverage: Buildings shall cover a total of not more than 40% of the net buildable area of a Mixed Use Development. Net buildable area, for the purposes of this section, shall be defined as the gross land area minus: (1.) Area of land with slopes in excess of 25%; (2.) Area of land containing wetland soils; (3.) Area of land designated as Flood Plain and/or
 


Flood Hazard Areas; and then from the remaining area subtract 10% for access drives, storm drainage facilities and other infrastructure (excluding parking). The total area of all impervious surfaces shall not exceed 80% of the total area of the site.

E.	Building Height: No building shall exceed a height of 35 feet, Section 3.9 of the Zoning Regulations notwithstanding. Provided that the final development plan indicates that not less than 30% of the ground floor of the mixed use building (commercial and residential uses) shall be utilized for commercial uses, and that more than 20% of the total mixed use development site shall be committed as permanent green space, a multi-family, mixed use building shall not exceed 70 feet in height; otherwise the height shall not exceed 35 feet. For each additional two (2) feet in height (to a maximum of seventy (70) feet ), the mixed use building with commercial and residential components shall attain an additional one foot of building setback greater than the minimum yard setback for the underlying zone from any abutting residential zone or residential use.

F.	Maximum Area of any Retail Establishment and Proportionality: Not withstanding Section 5.2.B, no single commercial establishment within the MUD shall exceed 65,000 square feet in gross floor area, and no MUD shall contain more than one establishment of maximum size with all other establishments not to exceed 40,000 square feet in gross floor area. The commercial/ retail element of the MUD shall contain opportunities for smaller retail and/or commercial establishments, with not less than 25% of the total retail and commercial element area dedicated to retail establishments of less than 10,000 square feet each. (By way of example, if the total proposed commercial/retail establishment square footage is 125,000 sq.ft. then 31,250 square feet must be shown on the plan as being dedicated to commercial/retail establishments of less than 10,000 sq.ft. each.)

G.	Green Space: A minimum area of 20% of the total site for accessible, permanent green spaces (defined as all lawn and landscaped areas) shall be set aside or established, including areas for public use. Adequate provisions shall be made for the maintenance and upkeep of such green spaces, including recreational and public facilities provided therein, by an organization set up by the developer with the power of obtaining assessments through enforceable covenants against privately owned buildings or units within the development. Nothing set forth above shall be construed either as a requirement or obligation on the part of the Town of Portland to make any repairs or improvements subject to these covenants and restrictions or to enforce any covenant or restriction contained therein.

H.	Inspection Fees and Bonding: Prior to the commencement of any activities pursuant to the Special Permit for the MUD, the applicant shall provide inspection fees and bonding in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.2 of the Zoning Regulations, as required by the Commission. The Commission may require a separate bond for each phase of the Mixed Use Development.

J.	Signage: The MUD shall be permitted a free standing, internally or externally illuminated, monument sign, identifying the development and its major, anchor tenants (not to exceed three (3) tenants) at each main entrance to the development, to a maximum of two entrances. The combined total maximum area of all entrance signs shall not exceed one hundred twenty
(120) square feet. All other signage within the development shall be of the same general style, configuration and illumination to create an overall consistent sign plan that shall comply with
the standards of Section 8.4 of the Zoning Regulations.
 


K.	Liquor Sales: All establishments that propose sale of alcoholic beverages shall comply with Section 3.2, except that the Commission may waive the distance requirements of Section 3.2 as part of the Special Permit approval process. All premises that propose the sale of alcoholic beverages shall comply with all applicable State and Federal liquor licensing, permitting and other legal requirements.

L.	Frontage: Each MUD site shall maintain minimum frontage of not less than 200 feet on an arterial or collector street or state highway and shall maintain direct access to an arterial or collector street or state highway within the municipal boundaries of the Town of Portland.

M.	Phasing of Development:

1.	In the event that the developer proposes to develop the MUD in phases, the plan shall identify all phases, the development plan for each phase, a detailed narrative construction sequencing plan, and any other information required by  the Commission.

2.	The phasing plan of development shall identify the schedule of development of the commercial/retail elements and the residential elements of the plan. The approved plan shall contain a schedule that provides development of both commercial/retail and residential elements concurrently, with neither eligible to receive a Certificate of Occupancy while the other element is less than fifty percent (50 %) completed. This ratio shall be measured by the percent (%) of residential units in proportion to the percent (%) of square footage of buildings to be utilized for commercial/retail. For good cause shown, and following a public hearing, the developer may secure relief from this requirement as a modification to the approved plan provided that the Commission is satisfied that conditions beyond the control of the developer will prevent the execution of the schedule of development as approved.

N.	Architectural and Landscape Planning: The applicant shall provide a detailed narrative prepared by a licensed architect describing the architectural details and overall theme of the development. The details shall include elevation views for all buildings within the Mixed Use Development.  The applicant shall provide a detailed overall landscape plan, prepared by a licensed landscape architect that details the types and locations of all landscaping elements, including street furniture, for the entire site and streetscape. The plan shall take into account the use of native, non-invasive species of vegetation and shall provide for appropriate outdoor passive and/or active recreational activity areas, and landscaped parking strips, in accordance with Section 8.2.6.C. of the Zoning Regulations.

O.	Trash Receptacles and Outside Storage: All dumpster locations and/or outside storage areas shall be clearly identified on the site plan and shall be fully screened with permanent fencing, structures or plantings or a combination thereof. The locations for such facilities shall be determined by the Commission to provide safe, convenient and sightly locations that do not detract from the overall site design. The site plan shall also indicate specific locations for public trash receptacles, boxes for newspapers, and advertising materials.

P.	Utilities: Unless the developer demonstrates to the Commission that it is not feasible to place all utilities underground, the plans shall include underground utilities. The developer shall provide a report to the Commission, prepared by a licensed professional engineer, indicating that all utility services, including water and sanitary sewer, are adequate to service the MUD and are available to the site.

Q.	Public Improvements: In any circumstance in which access to a MUD is proposed from an existing Town road that does not meet current town design standards, the Commission may negotiate with the applicant to improve said road or roads to conform to the current standard. The Commission may require the applicant to install sidewalks on adjoining public roadways
 


if they will facilitate pedestrian traffic movements.   All sidewalks to be constructed shall meet the standards of the Regulations for Public Improvements.

R.	Fire Protection: The application and plans shall indicate compliance with Section 4.3.12.D of the Zoning Regulations.

S.	Parking and Loading: The applicant shall submit a comprehensive parking plan, including an analysis of parking demands based on current industry standards for the proposed uses within the MUD in order to demonstrate to the Commission that the proposed parking and loading areas will be adequate to provide safe and convenient parking for customers, vendors, patrons and residents of the MUD. All parking and loading areas shall be internal to the site, screened from public roadways by buildings or landscape elements.

T.	If the Commission deems it desirable and of benefit to the public, the Commission may require that the developer grant to the Town of Portland a free license to permit public parking within a portion of the MUDs parking area to accommodate public events and to encourage pedestrian traffic within the surrounding commercial area.

U.	Time Limits for Development: The applicant shall present a schedule of development to the Commission. The Commission may impose a time limit on the development for its phased completion. The Commission has the authority to revoke the special permit if the time limits are not adhered to, provided the applicant is first afforded an opportunity at a public hearing to establish good cause for the delay in completion.

9.17.6	Procedure and Application

A.	The procedure of making application for and obtaining approval of a Mixed Use Development Special Permit shall be governed by the laws applicable to Special Permits in the Town of Portland, as more particularly required in Section 10.4 of the Zoning Regulations.

D.	Preliminary Development Plan Workshop: The applicant may submit eight (8) copies of a Preliminary Development Plan to the Commission for purposes of a workshop review. The purpose of this workshop is to receive input, comments and suggestions from the Commission, which would allow the applicant to decide whether to proceed with the expense of preparation of the Final Development Plan and Special Permit application. The applicant may return for further guidance from the Commission prior to the filing of a Special Permit application. Any opinions or suggestions expressed by members of the Commission as to the Preliminary Development Plan shall be tentative only, and shall not hinder or preclude
 


such members from making an independent judgment as to the Final Plan of Development based upon all evidence in the record at the time of a final decision.

E.	The plans submitted for the Special Permit shall include or be accompanied by the information as more particularly required in Section 10.4 of the Zoning Regulation and shall also include a traffic study of the area as it may be affected by the proposed development, including present and anticipated traffic counts, flow patterns, traffic speeds, and capacity analysis of present and proposed interchanges, intersections and entrances serving the development shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Connecticut.

4.	The streets and drives will be suitable, and adequate to carry anticipated traffic and increased densities that will not generate traffic in such amounts as to exceed the level of service or adversely impact the capacity of the street network in the area.

5.	The development will be in keeping with the general interest and spirit of  the Portland Zoning Regulations and comprehensive plan.

B.	In acting to approve a MUD, the Commission may impose additional conditions as it deems necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community and to comply with the Zoning Regulations.

9.17.8	Modifications of an Approved Plans

After approval of a MUD, no subdivision or resubdivision of the merged single parcel as approved shall be permitted. Changes in any Approved Plan shall be made in accordance with Section 10.4.E of the Zoning Regulations.

Section 10.6 Adaptive Reuse for Historic and Cultural Preservation


10.6.1	Purpose: The Town of Portland has conducted an inventory of historically and/or architecturally significant sites and structures which are identified on the Historic Resources Plan (HRP) located within the Town of Portland Plan of Conservation and Development (POCD). The purpose of the adaptive reuse provisions of these Regulations is to foster the restoration and renovation of these significant buildings and structures which have value to the community and to
 

preserve and adaptively reuse them by incorporating them into new development and/or change of use proposals to the fullest extent feasible.

10.6.2	Procedure: When any development or change of use proposal includes one or more sites or structures identified within the HRP, the applicant is required to submit an application to the Commission in accordance with ZR Section 10.4 (Special Permit Standards and Procedures). The Town shall refer the application to the Portland Historical Society at least 30 days prior to the public hearing for its review and comment.

10.6.3	Criteria: The Commission shall consider requiring adaptive reuse when:

A.	There is historic, architectural, cultural, economic or other value to the Town to justify renovation and preservation, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission.

B.	The long term benefits of the proposed adaptive reuse outweigh any negative impact on the neighborhood of the proposed project and on the Town as compared with the alternative of having the structures demolished or remaining vacant or under-utilized.

10.6.4	Performance Standards: In addition to Section 10.4, the following standards are required:

A.	The proposal incorporates the existing building(s) or structure(s) in the present location, or includes a proposal for relocation which is found to be as suitable and appropriate as the present location.

B.	The renovation and remodeling of buildings and structures for adaptive reuse may not destroy or obscure essential architectural features. In addition, such architectural features must be maintained and enhanced to the extent that it is feasible and prudent to do so.

C.	For purposes of properties identified in the HRP, buffer areas may include any area available for landscaping.. When the Town or State grants permission, the owner or developer must also use areas within the public right-of-way to satisfy landscaping requirements.

D.	For purposes of properties identified in the HRP, if necessary parking cannot be provided on site, reasonable provision for parking shall be provided off site.
